218,King Julius,review 800another incredible nestyle ipa from the alwaysamazing tree house if this one was disappointing at all it’s only because it didn’t seem so extraordinary as to be one of the top 3 ne ipas ever as rated on ba  but this was still an amazing brew nonetheless maybe i waited a little too long with this one  canned date 72919 but i had wanted to wait to make this review 800 looks wonderful pours a nice hazy orangepale yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and glorious thick wide rings of lingering lacing that stayed throughout smells of very ripe fruit with food hoppiness  pineapple guava tangerine mango melon grapefruit and passionfruit some nice aromas of malt creamy vanilla bread and then some more faint floral and dank notes in the background taste follows the nose extremely well balanced and with good depth and complexity again a little dankness towards the finish especially as the beer warmed very well hidden higher abv smooth luscious slightly sticky fairly soft mouthfeel that coated the palate and was very juicy and easy to enjoy good amount of carbonation i thoroughly enjoyed this one just wish it could have had a little more power behind the bitter hops in order to tip the scales versus the solid malt backbone,4.5,0.700682693
219,Oude Geuze Vintage,ogv 12 375ml on 172207pours a clouded amber color with a small soon disappearing head which is unusual for 3fs geuze which normally stays coated by a fluffy lacing the whole timesmells of oak sweeter blue cheese stale malts earthen mushrooms and a wet cellar quality the typical 3f funk settles also in together with a nice lemon zest sourness softer than on their regular geuze leans heavily on the oaken barrel with an intriguing sweet and sour interplay on tophas a soft mouthfeel with a pleasant complexity to it amped up by an effervescent finish holding the sourness in balancetastes aqueous almost flat with some wood bark and muted toffee malts turns more wooden during midpalate with an uncompromising lemon tartness during the finish the beer ends utmost dry with a lingering lemon zest tartness revealing mushrooms mold and cream cheeseactually this appears less balanced than the regular geuze especially next to ag the ogv is just not as complex its late sourness is almost too much to take overpowering everything else with just a crisp lemon appearance cutting noteably through,3.67,0.700665708
220,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,strong head production with over two fingers of fluffy gorgeous snow white head from a moderate pour retention is good leaving no lacing behind almost a milky haze to the burnished gold body light straw color in the sun some liveliness as well but its not a sparkling bodysour and funky nose along with waves of oak honey and wildflowers that occasionally waft over from feet away vinegar hay flowers honey oak must very light skunk grass apple its a complex melange of potent aromas that is really difficult to describe like the wind blowing through the trees and carrying with it all of the notes of the forest mixed togethertart and mildly fizzy on the palate with a sourness that comes across almost neutral and a touch vinegary the sourness yields to robust oaky tones but as the finish quickly sets in with tones of apple pear and cider the sour clings to the gums similarly musty and very slightly skunky on the palate with tones of earth leather tannins and mushroomsthe flavor ends with a light dancing quality but up front its more of a soft playful punch gentle but with a surprising firmness very lively fairly dry and overall a very short sip on the palate yet with lingering sour and funk on the tongue and gums one can very quickly be ready for the next sip or just as easily savor the lasting funkoverall one of the more difficult beers to rate and review i have encountered in ages in terms of flavor it is so complex and well blended that it truly is tough to describe and yet the overall presentation is nearly flawless i quibble a touch with the mouthfeel although its by no means poor rather it is perhaps the only part of this entire experience that i find less that world class primarily due to the fizz up front that makes savoring the entire sip difficult instead of focusing on the back half and aftertaste which is about all that it allows that lingering finish is truly the feels saving grace along with the dry character and lingering funk and sournesswithout question a superb expression of brewers art fully deserving of its high ratings and worthy of carrying the burden of drie fonteinens lofty reputation,4.51,0.700513324

271,King Sue,date canned on 081919 enjoyed on 090919appearance sound the haze alarm sue looks like a glass of full on fresh pureed oranges with a finger and a half of sudsy almost whipped cream looking white colored head just straight up bright almost floresant orange in color but a thick and chewy looking beastaroma pow up front there is just this huge blast of tropical fruits but it is a very multifaceted aspect as the mango brings a thick syrupy sweet element while the pineapple and orange contribute a juicy sweetness as well they also have a soft and at times somewhat acidic quality the more i try to pick out another part the orange i get underneath all the various fruity aromas there is an awesome slightly dank but very pungent ultra green and herbal dry hopping component it may not be the most varied nose ever but its what toppling goliath has managed to do with it that is the most impressivetaste the first sip is a well balanced mixture of equal parts assorted citrus fruits and that incredibly thick almost blanket like dry hopping which brings in pine some grapefruit and a mild dankness much like on the nose the mango orange and pineapple have a unique ability to feel at once soft and sweet yet sharply acidic at the same time bitterness is present but doesnt taste like it is anywhere approaching 100 ibus beyond this point the taste doesnt change all that much and these aspects tend to carry through to the end which is just fine out of the back end there is a mildly aggressive hop bite that becomes more assertive as the beer warms coming up to temperature also unleashes more flavors of orange much like was the case with the aroma there is also a tartness which brings to mind kiwi nothing overt but it is there the texture is full and mostly creamy with some active carbonation i probably lean more toward west coast ipas but what really does it for me here is the magnificently pungent almost explosive dry hopping that surrounds everything,4.49,0.697201049
272,Nelson,its a light gold color the appearance is not representative of the overall huge flavor it has the smell is fresh like orange juice and very piney the taste is super refreshing and light and very flavorful and the ending notes are exceptionally loaded with fresh hops its very high on the drinkability scale its an amazing beer in the ipa category,4.63,0.697091164

282,Parabola,100th review  a decent little start at least 2019 another fantastic addition to my parabola verticals  this is the beer that keeps on giving year after year uniquely beautiful earth and fire dark garnet in color perfectly clear and rather more transparent than you might expect wonderful rich nose with milk chocolate dark chocolate biscuity malts and espresso if i would ever give any beer a 55 for anything which i won’t i’d give parabola that perfect score for taste if i could give it a 495 i would it is so wonderfully deep and rich and delicate and complex i can’t even really begin to describe it taste it for yourself the mouthfeel is also world class light and chewy at the same time just about as good as it gets so this was so good i decided to pull a 2016 out of my cellar and try it against the fresh well there just aren’t enough superlative adjectives in the english language to adequately describe this beerdrinking experience i could resort to long strings of expletives but that would be rather gauche suffice to say that everything great about the 2019 has improved markedly in the threeyearold version richer more smoothly blended better integrated abv more thunderously powerful blowyoursocksoff intensity unbelievably wonderful i’ve upped the numerical score to reflect this amazing beer’s potential for cellaring,4.74,0.696553487

284,King JJJuliusss,drank from a 1 pint can purchased at tree house brewing company charlton ma 061219 served in a tekucloudy marigold yellow appearance the nearly opaque body was topped by a frothy fingertall bright white crown that slowly receded a wall of streaky spotty lacing coated the glass and stuck around almost until the drink’s endthe nose was amazingly hoppy and fruity huge tropical fruit presence guava and mango came through big time loads of honeydew melon too there was an intense peachy quality as well along with a touch of dankness appropriately sweet for the style as the beer sat citrus notes appeared as did a subtle boozinessthe favor was also fantastic punchy melon notes led things off on the front end generic tropical fruit notes were also apparent citrus came through in the center nice melding of juicy orange and tangerine flesh some pithy citrus peel appeared on the back end and the finish moderately bitter with time the bitterness decreased but some booze appearedoutstanding soft creamy plush mouthfeel fuller bodied for the style the liquid contained a super fine fairly zippy effervescence that fluffed up beautifully on the palate signature tree houseas much as i enjoyed king jjjuliusss it seemed fairly similar to the other julius variants overall a very impressive offering though probably not the greatest hoppy beer on the planet,4.72,0.696419433
285,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,back as pitch with a thin and light tan head wonderfully rich coffee on the nose less bourbon than typical for the brewery but still added to the otherwise simplistic brew this is in my top two or three for certain though as what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in execution and refinement,4.67,0.69641517
286,Ground State,2018 releasea pours black with a half finger of colalike dark brown head average retention and almost no lacings strong coffee light cocoa and vanilla bean and mild rounded bourbont rich and strong coffee dominate the flavor alongside a light but very well integrated sweetness dry oak and bourbon mild roastiness and mouthcoating coffee through a long finishm mediumfull body chewy with mediumlight but cutting carbonationo bottle logic proves again its deftness with its barrel program coffee dominates but the base and barrel provide nice though admittedly light accents the only knock on this is that it might be considered a bit onedimensional and i’m not getting any maple flavor,4.45,0.696410696
287,3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,great murky color super smooth i would have bet anything that this wasnt 10 complex danky citrus tropical aroma and flavors that match there was an enticing sweetness to the aroma and flavor as well made it smoother among my top ipas all time,5,0.696340206

296,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,finally got my lips on this one an extra hopped version of their now famous pale ale and its predictably awesome the thing about this and about so many of the dry hoppy trillium beers really is that they seem to know when to stop and in some ways i like this as much for what it isnt as i do for what it is its not green and vegetal and forced over saturated harsh or bitey and that alone makes it better than so many others out there in this style right now soft yellow even light greenish in color its muted looking thin and nicely bubbly it smells awesome citra all over this but not modern day citra like citra when it first came into vogue and nobody could get enough of it so distinctive and fresh lemony and lemongrassy with a beautiful freshness to it that almost is as relevant as the aroma it contributes light green tea a softly starchy but dry grain base and a level of refinement evident that i am not used to in these the flavor is as good as the nose pineapple and honeydew and lemon zest all come to mind but this isnt intense for all the dry hops it has they seem so well integrated not just on the surface but fundamental to what this is and that is rare light bitterness at the end but enough for this to appear balanced awesome carbonation makes it feel really light and the grain base is dry and simple but rustic enough to contribute something and i really like that with the juicy hops in here a really worthy beer highly acclaimed and for good reason,4.44,0.695710723
297,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2018 vintage bottled on 101618 purchased at loosa brews tuscaloosa alviscous black pour straight from the bottle goodlooking body to the beer with small amounts of tan head that fail to rise very high at the temperature it is poured the head settles into a very thin ring around the beerright away getting a lot of vanilla barrel and roasty malts on the nose underlying sweetness that brings out dark fruit but a very wellbalanced aromas that invite further complexity as the beer opens up and warmslots of espresso flavors serve the predominant force here but is quickly balanced out by a very potent barrel presence oak fudge and hints of vanilla weave in and out however they never seem to gain their footing long enough to keep a consistent balance while i love all the individual components i just seem to be getting too much roasted malts and bourbonbody has a good viscosity smooth with a carbonation that is present but not too sharp soft mouthfeel overall with a lingering stickiness and fair amounts of mouthcoating warm booze down the hatch the feel of this beer is definitely one of its strongest characteristics for me,4.19,0.695701203
298,Blanc De Blancs,a pours a bright medium straw golden in color a small one finger head forms and dissipates quickly down to a trace of bubbles around the edges of the glass the body of the beer is nearly entirely clear the lacing is minimal with the lack of a prominent heads starts off with a mild to somewhat assertive white grape fruitiness on the nose just a touch of crisp tartness is present in the scent but the chardonels really shine through here the scent displays a little bit of grapey sweetness but not a whole lot my overall impression of the smell is that of a slightly tart offdry chardonel that has just a touch of funky dryness at the very endt starts off by assaulting the tongue with fairly aggressive punch of juicy sour flavor the grape fruit flavors take a back seat to the overall sour flavor although the tartness is derived out of the fruit in the middle of the drink the sourness becomes somewhat acidic and very reminiscent of a war heads candy after the peak of the sour flavor a touch of funkiness creeps in and gives more of a grainy flavor underneath the tartness dryness from the barrel is detectable at the end of the drink although the prominent flavor is still juicy and somewhat fruity tartnessm this beer is very true to the style and feels pretty much like a champagne the only difference between a champagne and this beer is the perceived level of thickness because this beer feels fairly thick on the tongue this is more of a sipper due to the harsh sour flavors in the taste profileoverall this was way different than i expected i was expecting more of a winelike drinking experience given the name ingredients and style with that being said this is still a tremendous beer if you are a sour fan this offers a great juicy sourness in addition to some great complexity from the yeast and barrel aging,4.55,0.695683544
299,The Broken Truck,batch 4 bottled 118a pours a pale golden somewhat hazy with two fingers of white foamy head very good retention and some dots and streaks of lacing champagnelike effervescences musty and dusty in a good way like a wine cellar moderate amount of earthy funk and light apple and graininess a very appealing and elegant expression of brettt upfront light apple tartness sweet graininess and earthy barnyard upfront followed by light earthy funk apple and some sweet maltiness almost no sournessm medium body medium and fizzy carbonationo amazing bretty nose the taste is a bit subdued but still enjoyable,4.39,0.695674879
300,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,happy new year aged for four yearseasily one of the best fruited sours i’ve had the aromas explode with cherry raspberry and cranberry with a nice musky earthiness rounding it out there is a prevalent raspberrycranberry tartness in the flavor but it is not nearly as overwhelming as most american wilds the four years of aging in the bottle have mellowed out the gently sweet malts and alcohol presence wonderfully and the result is an immensely smooth silky bright palate complex fruity estery yeast character a very special ale as it should be at 25bottle93100,4.63,0.69563876
