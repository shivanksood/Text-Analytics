0	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	2016 Silver Wax. Aroma has whiskey, maple, toffee and umami. Taste has wood barrel, umami, dark fruit, maple and toffee. Bitter cacao and coffee aftertaste.	4.8
1	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	The beer pours Pitch Black with a frothy tan head. The bottle gushed when I opened it. It smells and tastes of maple syrup, coffee, creams brûlée, vanilla, and warm bourbon. The feel is slick and smooth.	4.74
2	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Probably the smoothest beer I have ever had. Smelled better than it tasted. Lots of notes on the nose from vanilla to caramel/Maple to figs, but the taste didn't follow suit and it mostly being Maple supported by the others notes on the nose and barrel. No discernible alcohol present but the bourbon flavor was there from start to finish. Carbonation was lacking and would have helped the beer. Overall this was an excellent beer on par with Mexican Cake Reserva.	4.68
3	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Dark black, very thick, a little bit of tan head. Smells amazing - coffee and a little bit of maple jump out at you, along with chocolate and vanilla and other sweet smells. The taste is no letdown either, coffee is more up front, and maple is on the back end, with a lot of caramel / chocolate / dark fruit in the middle. Super thick mouthfeel with zero alcohol burn.. I was fully prepared to be disappointed by this beer - not that I expected it to be bad, but just that it might not blow me away. I was wrong. Probably the best beer I've ever had.	5
4	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Poured black as ink with thin ruby edges at 58 degrees; fast fizzy cinnamon brown head; no cap retention, ring or lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong maple nose with molasses and roast coffee grind right behind. Sweet maple syrup and molasses up front; bitter roast coffee; dark fruit - cherries and plums with chocolate middle; no booze; maple and coffee on backend. Thick almost chewy feel; heavy full body; rich velvety tongue coating; no barrel or astringency; warming from 12%; creamy feel/linger on tongue. Overall awesome; strong long lasting maple nose; main flavors are in harmony; subtle dark fruit and chocolate notes add layers complimenting the whole; no hint of whiskey or barrel notes; and the feel is superb; world class!	4.97
5	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	she’s got heat....but man is she somethin nice! lots of barrel presence. maple goodness on the nose. thick and chewy. flavor is all barrel, booze and molasses. What a treat.	4.75
6	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Amazing brew. The maple aroma pours out of this bottle upon cracking. The pour was pitch black with a nice brownish red head. Carbonation holds and the beer is thicc AF	5
7	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Finally got to try the white whale. Pours like syrup, smells like syrup. Seems like it should be just a perfect beer, but I don't think TG does coffee as well as the other best breweries. I definitely got some green pepper.	4.3
8	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Had this on tap at the 12-15-18 release in Decorah. The aroma on this was amazing and was a step above the flavor. This beer is a very good mix of coffee, barrel and maple but just shy of a perfect rating. Maybe because the expectations are so crazy high?	4.85
9	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Had this on tap At the KBBS release 12/15/18 pour was super dark, no head even when i attempted to swirl it. great aroma, lots of coffee and barrel. Taste was silky velvety smooth. Overall an amazing beer.	4.89
10	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Great beer, but didn't seem to be worth the hype. For a $1000 secondary market, should have been perfect, and just failed to miss the mark for me. The nose was incredible, but the taste almost had a metallic tinge to it.	4.3
11	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	"Batch one, 2013, Enjoyed at GAB bottle share
Pitch black thick oily rich, thick legs, touch of head. Nose loads of maple thick dark chocolate, cocoa, hint Smokey, roasty coffee, coffee syrup, nice barrel vanilla and thick maple, vanilla ice cream. Taste velvety creamy smooth thick dark chocolate, cocoa, big maple syrup, vanilla ice cream, touch of Smokey, roasty coffee, lurker nutty coffee and hint of bitterness, mild toasted oak vanilla barrel, no booze, earthy coffee late, thick dark chocolate.  618 characters"	4.91
12	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Pouring with a thick viscosity that's damn near reduced balsamic, a blackish-brown gloss begins coating my companion's lips at first sip, like she's gone full goth. A uniform, dark mocha blanket builds over top of the void black body, but that quickly fizzles out, leaving nothing but brown staining legs that coat the glass with a swirl.. Hypnotizing aromas of deep, dark smoky maple swirl into a luscious malt that brings to mind dark cocoa wafer and mocha. A surprising barrel presence graces the nose without any heat, exhibiting a super oaky but dark wet char that's not spicy or overpowering. The bourbon barrel also delivers a lightly sharp toasted coconut scent as it warms.. Intenesly rich and smoky maple flavors are met with a deeply earthy, dark roasted coffee that I don't recall getting as much of in the numerous Mornin' Delight pours and bottles I've had over the years. Raisinets and dark cocoa wafer intermingle with the aforementioned flavors, while a substantial charred oak and bourbon complexity amps KBBS up considerably. The black peppery woodiness adds a mild heat, and the divine maple aftertaste lingers forever, with a nicely warm exhale..  1,536 characters	4.87
13	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	This is the beer that I always thought Morning Delight should be - the maple syrup is prominent in the nose and taste, but not so forward and overwhelming that it becomes a bit cloying and unpleasant. The barrel is a bit subdued, but still comes through clearly.. KBBS is a once in a lifetime beer that I am sure I'll be chasing for a while now. As I shared this bottle with five friends, I only received about a two ounce pour - which I nursed for a bit and smelled more than tasted. It's so sweet that I think it is best enjoyed as well - let it warm up, let the oily texture because a little more fluid. It's a tremendous beer and best enjoyed very slowly.	5
14	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	A buddy of mine called me one night and said that I needed to come over and try this new beer he found. Man am I glad I did because it was and is the best stout I have ever had!	5
15	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	its always an occasion to drink what is deemed on this website to be the best beer in the world. regardless of what one may think about how such rankings are figured, it is a treat to say the least. i remember when i was heady and westy 12 before that, times have changed! after a couple of narrowly missed opportunities to drink this one over the years, my man drlovemd87 came through in the clutch with this rarest of the rare bottle. my pour is as thick as paste, slick and black like crude oil, and without hardly any head to it, near still in appearance, shiny, almost gelatinous looking. the aroma and flavor are intense but unfortunately (to me) familiar, i wanted this to be strikingly different, at least from a quality standpoint, and as good as it all is, its not head and shoulders above all else, it might not even be my favorite barrel aged coffee stout i have had this year (shhh). a few things are immediately obvious to me. the first is that whatever barrels these were, they seem to have housed some excellent whiskey. its not more or less of it, nothing about the oak profile specifically, but the bourbon character itself seems obviously better than most of what else is out there, this i will grant. the second thing, is that saying something like this is objectively better than something else in its category that is notable and near perfect and all of that, is highly problematic, approximations and cloudy memories and nothing more than opinion. factually, this isnt that much better than any number of great beers in its field, and i will stand by that. i cant spend the whole time drinking this thinking about the merits of a ratings system i dont control or other beers i like better though, that would be a foolishly wasted opportunity to enjoy quite literally the best. its full of rich bourbon, heavy vanilla and maple syrup qualities, even the texture of maple syrup, tons of barrel char and earthy burnt dark grain and chocolate, and a well integrated high end coffee profile as well, in some ways quite simple, but impossibly mature and nuanced, enhanced magically by the whiskey, and with lingering sweet, bitter, raisin, cocoa, and bourbon character. its as good as they say it is, that is not my comment. my comment is that others are at this level too. i am enormously thankful to have been able to drink this one, especially without having to pay the absurd secondary market prices this is fetching. if you are considering dropping some coin for this on a forum or whatever, i would reconsider, not that this isnt awesome, but its likely that your local bottle shop or brewery has something comparable...	4.55
16	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Love the huge maple up front with balanced whiskey, subtle coffee, dark cocoa; semisweet, wee cinnamon, big whiskey, the coffee is superb. Yet bitter, bold, and some plum, too for flavors; luscious, creamy mouthfeel that lasts and lasts; bitter, sweet, whiskey, roasty finish.	4.93
17	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Jet black with minimal head and a shiny oily luster. The nose and taste is big coffee upfront and settles into more of a Maple and Bourbon focus as it warms, however all three of the Coffee, Maple, and Bourbon remain throughout and interact well as it warms. The mouthfeel is an absolute 5 from the chilly beginning though the warm finish, with smooth sticky oil-like viscosity. Easily meets the hype, never had better!	4.99
18	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Batch 3 (2016), Bottle #882. 12 oz bottle split three ways into TG tulips.. Upon opening, immediate maple syrup aromas fill the area. Pours a jet black, oily body with a small brown head that reduces quickly. The surface has a slick and oily texture.. Once in the glass the aromas intensify, with some coffee and bourbon coming through now, but maple syrup still dominates. It's odd, this smells more like maple syrup that actual maple syrup. Not artificial in the least bit..  937 characters	5
19	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	"2016 batch poured into a TG tulip.
Upon opening, maple just filled the room. Tons of maple.
Look is super viscous. Motor oil like. Opaque black. Coats the glass.
Taste is all maple up front and then finishes with a coffee flavor that I found to be a touch astringent. Faded as it warmed though.
Feel was super thick, viscous body. Coated my mouth and lingered.
Overall, this is one of the best beers I’ve ever had. Simply amazing flavors with the maple and coffee working together while maintaining balance."	4.9
20	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Incredible. Really exceptional. Most certainly the best smelling beer I've ever had. My buddy kept the bottle and it still smells like we just opened it, months later. Fills the room. Mouthfeel is thick and fudgy, espresso notes with that amazing maple and cocoa. Can't wait to drink my other one!	5
21	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Wow. More than lucky to be able to split a bottle of this with their own brewmaster! Lives up to the hype, the flavors keep changing in your mouth and you taste a whole buffet of breakfast, bourbon barrel adds some sweetness. Sticky and coats your mouth and throat and the taste lingers for a long time. TG creates some magnificent beers.	4.9
22	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	L: Dinosaur blood with a chocolate milk head. Ultra thick lacing with great legs like T-Swizzle.. S: Coffee, chocolate, maple, and whiskey (nothing new here, just basically copying and pasting what everyone else says). Once you pop the waxed top, the smell of good old fashioned Walmart-style American breakfast wafts throughout the room, lingering for hours to remind you of its greatness, cancelling out all other scents in the air like a heavenly beer Febreze.. T: Imagine a chewy, whiskey-dipped brownie corner -chased with a shot of maple syrup infused roasted coffee- that assaults your palate with a heavy, sugary sweetness that brings you back to the warm and blissful memories of childhood. This is Mornin' Delight elevated to god-tier status with the help from a little time spent in whiskey barrels. The result is sinfully divine..  1,845 characters	4.95
23	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	This beer turned out to be everything I wanted it to be. Great maple and coffee nose. Mouthfeel was viscous and coated the inside of my mouth, carrying those maple and coffee flavors with it. Delicious	4.71
24	Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout	Huge maple aroma right out of the gate and a vicious, dark pour. Maple dominates the nose but chocolate, barrel, and some coffee see also present. The mouth feel is massive and coats the mouth for days with adequate carbonation. It all makes for an impressive experience, but the taste falls well short of world class. There is a sour note that I also found in Mornin Delight. Some reviews have described it as coffee bitterness, but that's not what I get. It tastes like an off flavor. Since I've tasted the same thing twice I'm quite sure this isn't just a bad bottle. I'm not a fan of MD and the barrel aged version doesn't cover over the flaws.	4.31
25	Marshmallow Handjee	Tastes like burnt Vanilla Coke aged in gasoline barrels.. I love a boozy stout. I love adjuncts. And I like when they’re made with concern for tastebuds, not just for how extreme of a flavor they can get out of it.. Hard pass!	3.77
26	Marshmallow Handjee	Tastes like a barbeque pork chop dipped in vanilla icing. I do not understand this beer or the hype. I will not be hunting any more dark lord variant. Pass.	3.88
27	Marshmallow Handjee	Jet black pour, dark tan head. The base Dark Lord aromas plus heavy vanilla and some oak. Wow.. The vanilla is really forward on the taste, which enriches the flavors of the base beer. This is truly world class, IMHO.	4.74
28	Marshmallow Handjee	Split the 2018 version with 2 friends. I'll blame the perpetual hype but IMHO this was just a pretty good vanilla stout. Not 5 times better than FO, certainly not 2-3 times as good as Henna marshmallow. Yes the vanilla balance was perfect but honestly it started to wobble a bit as it warmed up. Not worth the price tag, hoping for a different variant this year.	4.42
29	Marshmallow Handjee	2017 vintage; drank 6/2/17 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Bottle 538 of 1227.. Black appearance..  405 characters	4.92
30	Marshmallow Handjee	For purposes of the review, both 2017 and 2018 were sampled together.. Appearance - The beer had the vicious blackness of Dark Lord.. Smell - The 2018 had more sweet chocolate marshmallow. 2017 leaned more Earthy and dry but still had an overall sense of sweetness..  799 characters	5
31	Marshmallow Handjee	"L: pours thick and pitch black with no head
S: marshmallow, vanilla, chocolate and barrel. Mighty fine
T: just like the nose and all in harmony
F: smooth, thick and creamy
O: world class"	4.9
32	Marshmallow Handjee	2018 vintage. About six months from bottling.. A: Pours jet black with a thick ring of dark brown, espresso-like head. No lacing and average retention.. S: Suuuuper rich dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, vanilla bean, dry oak barrel and cinnamon, and light bourbon. A little bit of cardboard. A very brawny BA stout..  1,190 characters	4.35
33	Marshmallow Handjee	Can cross this whale off the list! Mouthfeel on this beer is outstanding. If you have a chance to sample or get this beer I highly recommend it for sure!	4.94
34	Marshmallow Handjee	750 into a fff teku. l- looks great, thick and black. nice half inch head. s- aroma is off the charts! great vanilla and chocolate! vanilla never smelling artificial.  536 characters	4.96
35	Marshmallow Handjee	"Smells great, mouthfeel great.
Sweet sweet sweet. It is delicious. But i found, though delicious, it might be objectionable to drink a full glass due to the level of sweetness. I didn't get any barrel, mostly residual sugars. Nice beer, I don't find it elite."	4.59
36	Marshmallow Handjee	2018 bottle(silver wax). The hype is real! Been wanting this for as long as I can remember. Glad I finally got a chance to try a hefty pour at a nice share. It stole the show around a bunch of BIG beers. It’s crazy how much this tastes like toasted marshmallow fluff. Zero heat, and smooth as hell.	4.99
37	Marshmallow Handjee	Everything I love about barrel aged stouts. Thick, oily, coats the glass. Smells sweet, but not overly so. The taste follows with sweetness, barrel oak/vanilla flavors. Not overly sweet, with enough heat to balance it perfectly. (2017 Handjee)	4.94
38	Marshmallow Handjee	My review is for the 2018. I had it as a sample several times at DLD. It is an great beer but not exceptional. To me it was a little sweet and lacked the complexity and robust flavor of Chemtrailmix. I think 18' FVM was better as well.	4.32
39	Marshmallow Handjee	The beer pours a sludgy Pitch Black with a medium sized khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of vanilla beans, marshmallows, bourbon, and molasses. It tastes of vanilla beans, marshmallows, caramel, light bourbon, and molasses. The feel is medium and not too sweet. A great barrel aged stout, in just thrown off because it’s not nearly as thick as the base beer.	4.79
40	Marshmallow Handjee	"My own personal white whale. Never thought I would have the ""ammo"" to land it, but finally everything fell into place and it was in my hands. I went old school, getting a bottle of Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Darklord from 2012. Bottle #755/934. Poured black with a smidge/ring of tan bubbles around the edges. Vanilla fills the nostrils. Now I've heard people talk that this beer tastes like marshmallow. I've also had other beers people describe as marshmallow, but to me the flavor was not there. Here is a beer that is truly a liquid marshmallow flavor experience. Not only is that the flavor, but it coats the mouth and ""stays for days"". Supposedly, this is also a 15% beverage, but there isn't a trace of alcohol in this beer. Was it worth it? As I am a lover of the sweet brews, it sure was."	5
41	Marshmallow Handjee	This is hot, but full of marshmallow, vanilla, bourbon, and big dark malts; solid mouthfeel. But I want so much more from the body and flavors; such a hot, yet creamy finish. The nose is the best. Great to try.	4.54
42	Marshmallow Handjee	"2017 bottle, kept at ~45F since release.. Bourbon and sticky caramel on the nose.
Taste is bourbon, sugar, vanilla, and chocolate with a fantastic lingering sweetness that coats your mouth. Just insanely good!"	5
43	Marshmallow Handjee	2017 Bottle, Split just two ways :-). This beer lives up to the hype. Pours super viscous black and delivers with a full flavor cascade of fudgy vanilla bourbon dark lord that coats the mouth and makes one inevitably smile.	4.83
44	Marshmallow Handjee	2016 bottle poured into a Dark Lord Teku. Split three ways. Thank you Ryan for sharing this beast!. Pours an opaque black body with a small brown head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and a little lacing. Sticks to the glass upon swirling.. Aromas are potent and come through more intense as this beer warms. Vanilla beans and milk chocolate are prominent, bourbon, a tad bit boozy but in a great way. On the tongue is straight vanilla, chocolate covered marshmallows, rocky road fudge. Mouthfeel is rich and thick, especially as it warms..  631 characters	4.88
45	Marshmallow Handjee	"2016 bottle poured into a teku.
Very opaque black and thick looking upon pouring. Coats and clings to the glass.
Aroma is tons of vanilla bean and some booze. Bourbon is present for sure.
Taste was straight bourbon vanilla bean but the beer was very balanced and not overly boozy. As this warmed, the bottom of the glass got even better as the vanilla popped more.
Feel was thick. Very viscous, as expected. Coated the tongue and mouth and lingered.
Overall, this lived up to the hype and then some. Just an outstanding and delicious beer!"	5
46	Marshmallow Handjee	Vintage 2014: The beer has developed quite nicely and has evolved into almost a flavor profile that resembles a spirit. Absolutely stellar.. Vintage 2017: True to its name, the flavor is sweet like marshmallows. Thick mouthfeel. Overall, a very well rounded beer.	4.78
47	Marshmallow Handjee	"2016 at a Vanilla Share served in tulip 4oz sampler. Look: Pitch black and no head, very motor oil look
smell: Big boozy bourbon fallowed by sweet vanilla and a finish of marshmallow
taste: marshmallow covered in vanilla dipped in bourbon... honestly its a huge marshmallow taste with big backing of vanilla and bourbon.
feel: holy shit this is a big beer, super thick, silky, motor oily... this beer lingers like no other.. Overall; one of the single best beers ive ever had, no were near over rated"	4.75
48	Marshmallow Handjee	"2017
Pours pitch black in the glass. Nose is bourbon, dark fruits, some vanilla on the nose, but not huge. Taste follows the nose, candied sugary dark fruits, vanilla is there but again, not huge. It develops more as it warms. Bourbon and oak are present but they are not at the forefront of the beer. They are blended down into the beer. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, lingers. Overall, the vanilla on this is not as big as I was hoping. It doesn't stand out and make you feel its presence like you would expect. I'm slightly disappointed, but I guess expectations and hype can't always win out. But there's no question this is a world class beer. 4.6. 2013 Bottle 380 of 711 Drank 4/15/18
Pours pitch black with a fizzy cola head that flames out quickly. Nose is rich toasted marshmallow, chocolate fudge, spicy barrel notes, alcohol . Taste hits the nail, wow, this IS NOT infected. Sweet, burnt sugar, creme brûlée crust, vanilla starts in the background and builds on your palate, toasted marshmallow, some dark fruits coming through, little bit of oak, warm bourbon. Feel is silky smooth. Overall, this is what I hoped Handjee would be when I tried the 2017. The vanilla, toasted marshmallow just goes on for days. Aged to absolute perfection. Not too sweet or cloying. Simply awesome. 4.75+. 2018 Multiple tap pours.
Pours pitch black with quickly dissipating thin mocha colored head. Swirl leaves gold stains and alcohol legs on side of glass. Nose is sweet vanilla, oak, dark fruits, brown sugar. Taste is chocolate, bourbon, wood, sweet roasted marshmallow wafts across your palate. Viscous, syrupy mouthfeel. Just an amazing beer. Tops 2017 easily as much bigger vanilla presence. 4.75+"	4.75
49	Marshmallow Handjee	2013 batch. I was a little concerned given the infection talk, but clearly no issues with this one.. L- Jet black, not a lot of head.. S- Solid vanilla with some bourbon. Sweet marshmallow as well..  583 characters	4.55
50	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.. This smells like heavy roast, pepper spice, rum spice, cocoa powder, oak, dark fruit, smoke, and espresso.. Both barrels don't necessarily come through here - it's more smokey rum than anything else. I'm not sure I actually get any apple brandy. There's a decent amount of pepper, and a touch of cinnamon, and a definite big helping of chocolate. There's some tobacco and smoke too, as is kind of common with this brewery. There's a touch of molasses syrup on the back end, too..  784 characters	4.09
51	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Pours motor-oil black with minimal head. Nose is seriously off, like a cross between an ashtray and burnt sesame candy. Booze is there, too, but largely overpowered. Taste is extremely muddled. Peppery spice, smokiness, minimal barrel presence, with a lot less sweetness than expected from the rum/apple brandy combo. Flavors blend much more pleasantly in the taste than the smell, the mouthfeel is pleasantly thick, but overall this was a real letdown.	3.8
52	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	B2, shared amongst friends.. Black, opaque, mocha froth head.. Aroma has booze, spicy cinnamon, vanilla and roasted malts..  457 characters	4.26
53	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with a dark mocha colored head.. Smell - The nose was the of a sweet barrel aged stout. The booze and cinnamon are noted, but not the heat.. Taste - At the front, my first impression was black licorice. It was not nasty black licorice, since it was balanced by chocolate syrup, coconut, and dry green apple. My disappointment was that the pepper spice of the base beer was gone. There was a hint of cinnamon, but little heat. The barrel notes become more pronouned as it warms, particularly the apple brandy..  741 characters	4.6
54	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	This is such a big beer and there is so much going on, it is great, but you can only consume about 4 oz before you're done or you get diabetes. Let's calm down on the ratings a little bit	4.01
55	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	2016 batch (#2) reviewed.. Hunahpu's is one of those beers that I loved the very first time I tried it, and I've been chasing that dragon ever since... unsuccessfully, as it turns out.. I've been lucky enough to try Barrel-aged Huna twice now - once at Great American Beer Fest, and for a second time when I won a bottle in a charity raffle. As it turns out, I drank my BA Huna alongside of Double Barrel Huna, expecting that I would be blown away by the Double Barrel... in fact, it was the exact opposite experience..  1,564 characters	4.2
56	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Black color with dark mocha head. Aroma is really spice forward with lots of cinnamon, rum and booze. Taste is desserty with fudge, chili, cinnamon and some heat on the finish. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Quite nice but not such a huge step ahead of the regular.	4.55
57	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Tasted from bottle. Pours black with beige head. Tasted against regular 16 Huna and 17 Bourbon BA Huna. Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy. More intense and complex than the Huna and Bourbon Huna. Excellent!	4.68
58	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Pours a jet engine oil dark body with a mocha-hued head. The cacao and spice come aromas are strong, along with the booziness from the brandy and rum barrels. The taste is like no other stout I've had. Brandy and rum blend together nicely to add some complexity to the richness of the nibs. The chiles and cinnamon are very noticeable as well, but are balanced out by the chocolate and alcohol so it's never too overpowering. The chocolate and vanilla thicken this beer, and the heat of the chiles and brandy/rum leave a nice heat. Phenomenal beer that deserves the praise it's received.	4.99
59	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Pours one shade shy of black with not head, just a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals chocolate, peanut butter and a hit of cinnamon. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation, a hit of heat and a kiss of acidity. All and all a nice beer but I don't get too much of the barrel.	4.23
60	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Pours a thick, oily pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. The beer downright sticks to the glass as you swirl it, leaving a short-lived film of dark beer and white lace. Smell is somewwhat subdued, pretty underwheming compared to the taste. Cinnamon is most noticeable, with a sort of odd earthy, musty, woody aroma being pretty dominant as well. Perhaps a hint of coconut there. Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. I was considering waiting for CBS for my 100th review, but I think this one will do nicely. The barrel-aging really did wonders to the quite overrated Hunapuh here, adding a certain complexity from the brandy and rum notes along with making the chili stand out more and generally mellowing out the beer, creating a richer harmony. Still smells really weird though.	4.35
61	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	"Very Dark brown with a tan head. It appeared to be less thick on the pour particularly compared to Man Bear Pig which we had drank before this beer.
Boozy on the nose but not over powering which is just the way it finishes. Malt chocolate, slightly spicy, sweet molasses but not overly sweet. I liked the balance in flavors.. T- Kind of weird (not saying that's bad). It's mostly chocolate (mix of milk and dark like the smell) with some chili heat on the finish. Every now and then, I get hints of dark sugars and a bit of green apple. . F- Medium feel. A little booze burn. Could be thicker and richer. .  809 characters"	4.64
62	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Poured into a tulip glass via bottle (2016 Edition). color is a mocha brown with tan foam. smell is rum, cinnamon, Chilies and chocolate.  378 characters	4.66
63	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	This review is for batch 2.. L- Similar to most stouts. Dark brown to black with a mocha head. Started around a finger on the initial pour, faded to a thin ring that lingered. Medium-thin pour.. S- Blend of dark and milk chocolate. Some molasses and chili. Every now and then, I get a little bit of green apple from the brandy..  811 characters	4.36
64	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	With so much talk about this being a disappointment This beer was fantastic. Has a slight chili smell. This is some chili up front followed by nice barrel flavor.some spice comes through and had a rich body. Overall really delicious.	4.44
65	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Thanks much to chicagopubcrawler for making this one happen.. Was worried about the b2 releases. This one in my opinion doesn't follow the poorer reviews.. A beautiful stout. Not a big pop off the cap but the pour has a nice thick lacing. Smell is perfect chocolate. No spice just perfect refined chocolate..  844 characters	4.71
66	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	"Batch 2, snifter, shared with my brother. L: black, oil, quarter inch brown head that sticks around for a minute or so
S: molasses, Brandy, RUM, cocoa, really hits the nose nice
T: Cocoa and vanilla hit, quickly followed by the barrel character. There's a nice combination of the rum and the Brandy character. Definitely booze, but I think it's drinking Really well right now. The Finish is very much chili's which stay with you as you take more sips. Absolutely delicious
M: medium mouth feel, would have loved a little more thickness, but only a small knock here
O: absolutely world class, the smell continues to carry through, and as the beer warms you really get very nice barrel character, black strap molasses, vanilla/cocoa, and all the chili's on the end.
World Class, and drinking great"	4.73
67	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	"2016 vintage
750ml bottle poured into a balloon glass. A- pours pitch black in color with a thin head that disappears almost immediately, leaving nothing behind. S- aroma opens with roasted coffee that gives out lots of green bell pepper notes, as well as some earthy notes. The barrel notes are prominent, with apple brandy popping through and providing notes of green apple peel. The rum gives aromas of brown sugar and molasses. Undertones of cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa and chilies.  1,113 characters"	4.64
68	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Not sure if I got it from someone who did not keep it well but I would say it's extremely overhyped. Way too smokey which overtook the cinnamon. Tasted like bad crab apples which came from the slight cinnamon and apple brandy.	3.96
69	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	"B2. Not having tried the elusive first batch, I can't comment on whether the second batch is actually inferior compared to the original. Given the way it tastes, however, I'm willing to bet that the second batch isn't so much the shadow of its predecessor that people claim it to be, but its perceived mediocrity is a result of the evolution of the craft beer market and the trends that have changed since the original ""DB Huna"" graced this earth almost three years ago and shocked all those that were lucky enough to try it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Perhaps I'm becoming further and further estranged from my adopted American roots, but since trying the original Hunahpu on the Mexican Stout special and drinking the Double Barrel, I've come to wonder how a beer with such flagrant flavors and characteristics has achieved what seems to be universal acclaim among its drinkers. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Whereas the mix of cinnamon, spicy vanilla, and dry chili spices seem to elicit an aroma familiarly recognizable as ""oriental medicine"" or ""chinese liquorice,"" these flavors--correct me if I'm wrong--aren't a mix frequently found together in North American cuisine, yet oddly it seems that most that try it seem to be able to appreciate or even confess to liking it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Maybe it's the #whalezbro effect, or maybe it's because all those unique flavors have been expertly melded into a thick 11% ABV sludge, but there are bound to be those that find this brew repulsive due to a personal aversion of one of its many pungent and exotic flavors; case in point, almost nobody who claims that this brew smells or tastes like oriental medicine profess to be particularly fond of oriental medicine, yet everyone seems to agree that this is a phenomenal brew.. Occam's razor would probably dictate that the superior flavor integrity of the base beer, removed from all the added adjuncts, is the reason for this possible anomaly; or perhaps that the combination of the said adjuncts with the base is what makes the otherwise repugnant flavors desirable. Yet when people tend to point out what is or has been most memorable about beers like these, the credit almost always seems to be given to the adjuncts rather than the base. God I'd make a shitty philosopher..  3,561 characters"	4.4
70	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	From bottle into Huna chalice.. Appearance was extremely dark with no foam head except for ring around edge of glass. Initially, smell was of brandy, some rum, along with chocolate and light cinnamon. Initial taste while cold was primarily brandy. Chcocolate and cocoa was most pronounced, with very little cinnamon. As it warmed, the chocolate stayed but rum barrel note really came out in a big way. This beer had tons of barrel character. Mouthfeel was medium for a BA stout.. Overall, a high end beer with tons of barrel character that changes the taste as it warmed. I am typically not a fan of regular Huna but this beer was tranformed by the barrel ageing into an exceptional brew.	4.43
71	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	"Review is of b1
Look: Almost a jet black, and pours thick as oil. Hugs the side of the glass. Has the thickest appearance of any beer I have had
Nose: Some heat with a sweet backbone. A slight smell of peppers with cinnamon more pronounced
Taste: So many waves of flavor. The apple brandy and rum work in perfect harmony. Almost no burn from the peppers is left. What is there is more the ancho than the pasilla. Super chocolatey and decadent.
F: Probably the thickest beer that I have had, even after a few years.
O: I'm not a huge fan of Huna, but this takes the beer to a whole new level. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had as everything seems to work together in perfect harmony. I never got to try this beer fresh, but it is holding up incredibly well. Although, I'm not sure it will improve much past where it is now."	4.94
72	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Rating batch 2, because I don't think this beer belongs on the charts where it is. Batch 1 is still phenomenal.. A weird bell pepper almost pickle like flavor ruins this for me. The cinnamon and vanilla are muted compared to batch 1. There is definitely some nice barrel character and the full bodied base beer shows, but they are overpowered unfortunately.	3.61
73	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Wow the nose of this is just stupid. One of the few double barrel stouts I have had before in which the balance of both barrels work out in unison. Sweet rum plus the complex apple brandy notes bring on a truly unique aroma I have never inhaled before. The taste follows pretty close but not fully. Getting more brandy and rum and much of the apple is lost. Spices coming thru as it warms up. Complex flavors and very rich thick mouth feel. Amazing!	4.85
74	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Batch 1 is one of the top 5 beers , drinking amazing right now. Spice has dialed down allowing apple brandy to shine. b2 needs some time . Little to spicy right now.	5
75	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	"Had on draft from a snifter at Perennial.
L: Dark, not totally black, but close, with a thin brown head.
S: Choc-o-lot
T: Very chocolate as well, cinnamon rounded out at the end. I didn't get a ton of heat when cold, but the second half of my pour it comes out nicely at the back end and really augments the rest of the bear. The whiskey is apparent throughout as well, but not as some of their other barrel aged beers.
F: Viscous and in a way that works well with the beer.
O: This was like drinking two different beers warm and cold, which was awesome. A nearly perfectly balanced beer and this coming from someone who usually doesn't like cinnamon in his stouts."	4.74
76	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	On tap at Hops & Pie(10/2017). Black appearance with a small tan colored head. Pleasant aroma of light chili peppers, chocolate malt, vanilla, cinnamon, light oak and a touch of whiskey barrel. Similar flavor, rich, malty and moderately sweet with a lightly spiced bitterness. Medium to full body with soft carbonation, a smooth feel and a balanced finish. An excellent sipper overall.	4.74
77	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium dark brown head that recedes quickly. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, Chillies, and earthy chocolate. It tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, mild spice from the Chillies, earthy chocolate, and light barrel. The feel is medium and well balanced. A great barrel aged stout, but not really blowing me away.	4.52
78	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Obsidian black, with burnt motor oil brown edges at a closer look, and very minimal visible carbonation, but for a thin dark mocha ring that dies to a silky surface fairly quickly.. Smell is potent of cinnamon toast and Red Hots, and lesser of vanilla nougat.. The medium to thick body has a crackly fizz that firms up and brings out a more dusty cinnamon than on the nose, while the barrel is splintery and adds some heat to the peppery sassafras of the oak that gives a hint of cola at times. Cocoa dusted dates comes out of the semi-dry, warming finish, as rounding chocolate and a smoky char continue to develop over top of the mild to low presence of spicy chili peppers..  886 characters	4.22
79	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a subtle but complex rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.. The cinnamon and chili work really well with the peppery, spicy rye barrel character, although I have to say that the cinnamon presence is way overdone here for my personal taste and that there is also not quite enough of a bitter/roasty counterpoint to the sweeter chocolate and vanilla notes. While mouthfeel is nice and creamy, it's still disappointing compared to Sump as well. Does not live up well to the hype.	4.3
80	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Had side-by-side with KBBS and it won the night. Retains all the amazing notes of regular Abraxas with a perfect barrel character and mouth feel. Amazing beer!	4.9
81	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Completely by accident, I ran across this beer at a craft beer bar that I frequent - had never heard of Abraxas. Barrel aged imperial stout sounded like the kind of beer I like, so I got a small taste just to see if I wanted a full pour. Didn't take long to decide...in fact, I had a second pour because I couldn't imagine any of the other 99 or so taps could have anything this delicious.. If you've had Canadian Breakfast Stout, and Prairie Bomb!, It tasted like a mix of the two. Absolutely delicious. Definitely World Class!	5
82	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Lucky enough to get a tip of when this was tapping at this year's Great Taste of the Midwest. Otherwise I probably would have missed it. Because with so many beers to try, I find it hard to keep track of when specific beers are being tapped. But I am very grateful that I was near the Perennial tent around 2:00 when they started pouring what turned out to be one of the best beers I have ever had.. Regular Abraxas has always been one of my favorite beers. I was curious to see what barrel aging would do to adjuncts that are already in a fairly perfect balance. It was amazing how the barrel stood out but yet still allowed all of the other flavors to shine through. The beer almost tasted like a candy bar but was not overly sweet in anyway. The barrel muted the adjuncts slightly but if possible, put them into even more of a perfect balance than the regular version.. This year's Great Taste took place on a fairly hot day making barrel aged stouts a bit harder to drink. But this stood out by far and I easily would have downed another pour had it not been in such great demand.	4.91
83	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Aroma has spicy notes like cinnamon and chili with whiskey and dark chocolate on top. Taste is spicy but well balanced with dark chocolate bitterness and light chili heat.	4.7
84	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Quite possibly the top beer of the night, in a tasting that included the likes of BBT, BA Sump, and multiple pre-2013 Dark Lord Variants.. The pour is viscous and black.. a dark tan head of foam settles around the glass, drawing out medium lace designs around my 5oz taster glass.. The nose is all cinnamon, with a subtle but apparent vanilla backbone. The Ancho is such a subtlety but the balance is incredible. Milk chocolate finish rounds out the flavors and holds the beer together. I’ve never experienced a beer where all the adjuncts work so well together..  638 characters	5
85	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Once in a while, a bottle comes along that you'd be happy to drink, even if it were poured on to a gravel road. Barrel-aged Abraxas is that bottle for me.. The peppers and cinnamon are so well-balanced that it's difficult to believe. I drank my first bottle of BA Abraxas side by side with a similar beer - Chemtrail Mix (2017) - and the differences were startling. Likewise, the differences from the base beer. Again, it's a matter of balance - also of mouth feel. BA Abraxas is so rich that it's almost a different beer. The chocolate comes out very distinctly, along with light vanilla notes. The nose is so robust, sweet, and full of bourbon that I'd almost be happy to just smell it.. While I still hate the secondary value that the beer carries, I'd trade for it every single year if I could - even if it carried a higher value..  916 characters	5
86	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	This is for 2016 BAA. Straight Cinnamon Toast Crunch. This is probably my favorite beer of all time. 2017 isn’t quite on 2016 level but it’s really good as well.	5
87	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Damn that’s good! rich cinnamon goodness I feel the peppers in my belly. The Barrel definitely makes it feel thicker and mixes with the cinnamon well.	4.75
88	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	2017 Bottle. Drank in a snifter.. World class beer. Definitely lives up to the hype. Highlight of the beer is how thick it is. It completely coats your entire mouth. Worth seeking out	4.78
89	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	"2017 vintage
750ml bottle poured into a snifter
Taken from notes, Aug 2017. Pours a deep black color with a thin khaki colored head that has short retention before setting to a ring around the edge. Cinnamon leads the way in aroma, followed by undertones of pepper skin, vanilla bean and chocolate. Peppery barrel aroma closes it out and adds some woody oak and a hint of caramel. Cinnamon leads the flavor as well and is immediately complimented by some peppery rye notes form the barrel that seems to enhance the cinnamon. Mid-palate brings out some sweet notes of cocoa & vanilla bean. The finish brings out just a hint of pepper heat, that is immediately followed by light notes of peppery rye, woody oak and a hint of caramel sweetness on the linger. Medium body with moderate carbonation, slightly creamy mouthfeel and warming finish. Take an already outstanding beer and age it in rye barrels, it's delicious"	4.7
90	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Legit smells like cinnamon toast crunch w/ cacao, whiskey, light pepper; tons of cinnamon, barrel, big malts, nilla, lasting whiskey. What a luxurious mouthfeel; bitter, big whiskey finish w/ notes of cinnamon, cacao, and light spiciness; wowzers, love this beer, again.	4.97
91	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	It just doesn't get much better than this. All the robust flavors of the base Abraxas plus the additional barrel vanilla and wood notes. Exceptionally well balanced. Simply Amazing!	5
92	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	2017 bottle. Chalice glass. Had at a share. 4 bottles-4 people with Barrel Aged Dark Lord '16, French Vanilla Militia '17, Marshmallow Handjee '17 and Barrel Aged Abraxas '17, in that order.. Poured completely black with minimal amount of caramel colored foam which only stuck around the edge of glass. I don't know if it was that I already had some high quality barrel aged beers before it or if it was Marshmallow Handjee just prior, but the smell was predominantly cinnamon and cinnamon alone. As the beer warmed, yes got a bit of cacao and chocolate, but the barrel was extremely faint and I got no semblance of coffee. Very similar flavor to the smell. It was predominantly cinnamon with only faint traces of other ingredients, even after letting it warm all the way to room temperature. The feel was good. On thicker side and sticky.. In the tasting it finished as a 3rd out of 4 for three of us (myself included) behind Handjee '17 and BADL '16, and 4th for the fourth person. I don't know if was the quality of the other stouts or the order in which we drank them (could have been), but the expectations were quite high and they weren't met. I, most of all had the high expectations of it being every bit as good as Handjee '17 and perhaps even better, but the beer seemed relatively one dimensional with the cinnamon dominating. The lack of barrel presence, especially compared to the three DL variants was obvious. Just didn't seem like BA Abraxas was all that much 'more' than a regular Abraxas..  1,647 characters	4.38
93	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	"I'm doing this off of memory as I've had the beer at the 2017 and 2018 Snallygasters, so I won't do a full review.
This is probably the best beer I have drank so far and that includes CBS, many mole' styles of beer, Xocoveza and various others.. The smell is similar to homemade hot chocolate with cinnamon.
The flavor is hot chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, marshmallow and a slight booziness.
What really makes this beer is the mouthfeel. For a high ABV, this is an amazingly smooth beer."	4.99
94	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	This is worth the hype. The aroma is off the chart good. Cinnamon is delicious and this reminds me of a snickerdoodle cookie. Tons of chocolate as well with subdued pepper, creamy vanilla, and subtle barrel in a medium plus mouth feel. I'm not tasting anything really complex but this is excellent and the cinnamon and vanilla make it a real treat.	4.81
95	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	Had a pour at the Shelton Fest, and this is one of the best beers that I have tasted. Coffee/cinnamon and barrel notes up front with some spice on the end (absolutely perfect balance). This beer is surprisingly drinkable given the ABV and flavor profile. Absolutely worth the hype.	5
96	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	5oz pour into a snifter. 2017 Edition. L: Pours pitch black with one finger of khaki head. Dissipates quickly and leaves a tan ring around the edge.. N: Cinnamon stix up front. Getting the spicy notes from the rye barrels. Oak, Bourbon, vanilla..  791 characters	4.79
97	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	2017 bottle shared amongst friends.. Finally, finally had the opportunity to try this one and, unlike usual (at least IMHO), the hype was warranted.. Extremely well balanced and smooth. Subtle chili heat balanced by a somewhat sweet chocolate. The alcohol is extremely well hidden but you get just enough barrel. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Just perfect.	5
98	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	among the very best beers by ranking because now i am quite convinced that it is one of the very best beers! it is absolutely incredible, huge thanks to my homie in saint louis for sharing this one with me, its one of those beers that due to limited production and insane hype, i thought i might never get to try! so glad i did. i was keen on the base beer, but these barrels take it to the next level. fudge brownie or cake batter comes to mind right away, the cocoa and the vanilla together really make it rich and desserty, but synergies abound in this one. the vanilla notes in the whiskey and the actual vanilla, the subtle rye harshness and the spice of the ancho pepper. the smoked element in the pepper and the earthy bitter cacao nibs, the barrel char and the black malts, and the chocolate and the cinnamon together is also an extremely unique interaction! so much going on here, all fudgey and gooey and dense. the booze is little more than warming, the oak envelopes the whole thing, and i feel cozied, snuggled by this beast. cinnamon and soft smoke linger with a charred character in the end, subtle maple and molasses notes, dark ra chocolate, and smooth mellow wood. its all so good, takes an absurdly well done base beer to the next level. i am not often one to clamour for barrels or freak out about them, but this really is a transformation and a maturation unlike any other. an absolute delight, i hope to encounter this one again!!! hands down the king of the adjunct stouts...	4.71
99	Barrel-Aged Abraxas	look: Very similar to regular abraxas. super dark pour with a small but potent burnt brown head.. smell: boozy cinnamon toast crunch. seriously. absurd how much this smelled like a childhood favorite cereal with a splash of bourbon in there. Cocoa prevalent too, but mostly cinnamon on the nose.. taste: cinnamon hit me first, big and up front, followed by the bourbon heat (arguably a tiny bit too much, but nearly perfect), than the chile. I love cinnamon dominated stouts, so this was perfect..  701 characters	5
100	Heady Topper	"Maybe I'm missing something but just cant get on this bandwagon.
This is a good beer but not worth the hype.
Beer has evolved and put this in the crowd. You can prob do better at a local brewery."	3.95
101	Heady Topper	One of the few perfect beers I've had. There's a strange contingent on the internet who like to whine that Focal Banger is way better and this is overrated, don't listen to them. Dumb contrarians who like to think their opinion is different and nuanced when it's just plain wrong. This beer is king.	5
102	Heady Topper	Moderately high haze, golden yellow color, with persistent creamy off-white head.. Aroma is caramel malt, biscuity, bready, and wheat grainy, with grassy, tropical hop, pickle juice, mango, grapefruit, lime.. Medium high hop bitterness, flavors of biscuity, caramel malt, with lightly bready hints and grassy, cotrucy hop flavors of grapefruit and orange peel.	4.25
103	Heady Topper	Copper colored with a very hazy complexion. There’s a quarter inch of off white on top. The aroma is of grassy to piney hops. I’m tasting grassy to vegetal to piney hops. The mouth is exceptionally smooth, quaffable and beckons further sips.	4.51
104	Heady Topper	Taking the advice of the can and leaving it in, so I’ll go with the general consensus that it looks pretty good. The nose absolutely juicy as can be, with fresh hop and tropical fruit notes coming in waves, it is inviting me to taste it. The taste is a lovely balance of hop bitterness and flavor, mostly tropical notes with a bit of floral hints. The malt smooths this all out and creates a wonderful balance.  1,041 characters	4.4
105	Heady Topper	Pours a hazy, golden-straw color. Has a pillowy, off-white head.. Aroma is tropical fruit and something kinda nutty. Guava, orange pith, orange juice. White bread.. Flavor is tropical fruits, and a bit piney. mangos, pineapple, and guava. Orange pith. It is a bit hot and astringent, but it plays with the flavors on offer. There is a sweet, almost nutty, flavor that carries throughout and is absolutely delicious. The retronasal olfaction is like a whiff of fresh hops. Finishes bitter and a touch sweet..  1,008 characters	4.66
106	Heady Topper	Had this several times, straight from the can. So the look rating comes from one time 2 years ago I poured into a glass. What can be said about this beer that hasn’t been said. It is actually a very balanced beer, despite the overwhelming aroma that is first experienced. That balance goes almost unmatched by any other beer since this beer came to me. A truly unique beer!	4.87
107	Heady Topper	Graciously provided by a friend, who was able to get this off eBay. We split a can in glasses. Of course it poured out quite hazy, milky, with a nice head and a peach colored glow. The nose was very nice, full of pineapple, mango and peach with some pine. The mouth feel was nice, smooth, full-bodied and soft with medium carbonation. The taste was a recap of the aroma with lots of tropical fruit and Pine. Bitterness was medium firm. The aftertaste had a bit of lingering malts which was nice. Not totally dry. No off flavors or aromas.. I am glad to have tried this. I understand it’s high regard because it was one of the first hazy ipa’s, however Michigan has M 43 and Bells official, both of which are very comparable. In fact I prefer Bells official to this., especially considering the price.	4.36
108	Heady Topper	"A - In can, so hard to see; looks clear and uneven bubbles form at top.
S - Pineapples and pine trees
T - Pineapple, pine tree, passion fruit, a pleasant sweetness and almost like a soda
M - Medium body; a bit on the thick side for an IPA
O - Very pleasant IPA that can probably be enjoyed by non-IPA drinkers"	4.7
109	Heady Topper	Highly over-rated beer. Not wurth the high price to buy it. Not much creativity with pine and grapefruit aroma and taste, Pine and Grapefruit is the most common flavor to bring out of hops. The beer did have a good mouth feel. I wouldnt suggest making any extra effort to get this beer	1.86
110	Heady Topper	My first Heady was a Thanksgiving treat and it ruined the entire day, nothing at the dinner table lived up to the experience of enjoying an ice cold Topper! Since that time I’ve enjoyed a few cases and rate this beer as my number two all time NE IPA! You can’t go wrong and it’s definitely worth the sacrifice to run one down!	4.73
111	Heady Topper	"Purchased two four-packs of 16 oz cans at brewery in Stowe, VT. Served in 12 oz snifter. Reviewed 7/27/19.
Appearance – 4.5.
First pour – Light yellow, clear.
Body – Yellow, hazy.
Head – Enormous (Maximum eleven cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, medium density, stabilizing at 6.5 cm, slooowly diminishing to a thick, cratered cap resembling a lunar landscape. Large, three-dimensional foam islands hang from the inside of the glass.
Lacing – Decent – mostly a continuation of the isolated foamy islands above.
Aroma – 3.75 – Herbs and resin, perhaps a weak grape or apricot.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins moderately bitter and resiny with distinctly no melon, fruit, or pine. Ends markedly bitter with a long hang-time. No alcohol taste or aroma (8 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 3 – Medium, almost creamy, lively carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 4.25 - (-0.25 points for undated individual serving container.) I must admit I was unimpressed. Perhaps I was expecting too much from the number one NEIPA. The appearance was excellent so no disappointment there. The aroma was OK but was markedly lacking in fruitiness. The flavor was also OK, but again fruitiness was lacking. The palate was just what is expected from a NEIPA. Overall, a decent NEIPA but I won’t be driving back to Stowe except to revisit von Trapp."	4.02
112	Heady Topper	Pours a semi-opaque, yellow orange with floaties and a rich, thick looking head that has excellent lacing retention. The smell is super juicy and fruity on the nose with a herbal complexity and a subtle, dank resin. Taste leads with pine, as well as grapefruit, melon, mango and citrus rind to make this juicy double, legendary!	4.58
113	Heady Topper	Really the best damn IPA. Perfect piney hop bitterness melange, nice citrusy zesty flavors, pear, grape, apple, really soft and smooth, don’t know what more you need in a beer. Could drink endlessly. This two month old can is as good as when I first got them.	4.74
114	Heady Topper	This is the original unicorn beer. As someone who lives within striking distance of Treehouse and only a couple hours from the VT border, surprisingly I have not tried Heady Topper until this last foray. I have to admit, eight years ago I'd have built a statue for the creator of this lovely stuff. Now it's a fantastic beer but others have caught up. I had a bit of a hard time distinguishing this from Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine however the beer was a tiny bit less pine flavored than Sip of Sunshine and gave a better buzz.. This has a little bit of everything going on in a very balanced way. There was the lemon zesty zing along with the resin piney bite. It was heavy enough to sip but not so heavy that I sometimes forget not to chew before swallowing like the juice forward IPAs from Treehouse.. The beer is instructed to be sipped from the can as it somehow magically loses its aroma if poured into a glass. I drank half from the can and half from a tulip glass and didn't notice a darn bit of difference in smell or taste. The beer has a small head to it when poured and a little more carbonation than your average IPA, it seemed..  1,737 characters	4.77
115	Heady Topper	Sampled at home. Poured into a pint glass (I don't care if the can says drink from the can). The aroma and flavor of this beer are amazing. I've been searching for this for a long time (Thanks Bret!). For me, this beer absolutely lives up to the hype.	4.75
116	Heady Topper	No canning date that I can find and I wonder if it’s not super fresh thereby negating some of the smell. My favorite IPAs usually have a stronger scent that draws me in. That being said, the taste is perfect. I love the slight bitterness. It has a soft feel although the newer NEIPAs are often softer. Perfectly balanced, I could drink this all day. Worth the hype always and the debate for me is whether Focal Banger is better or not.	4.62
117	Heady Topper	The Alchemist recommends that you drink Heady Topper straight from the can, which I did with the first one. Glad I poured the second, as this beer looks nearly perfect when released into a glass - a bright pineapple juice color, cloudy, with a fat head. Lacing remained in the glass throughout. The smell is a strong grapefruit and hops scent, which is echoed in the taste. It offers a citrus and bready flavor while being very refreshing and easy to drink. Each sip finishes with a punch of bitterness. Yet the mouthfeel is clean, not dense, refreshing and a little creamy. It is a great beer that lives up to its lofty reputation.	4.75
118	Heady Topper	I can be very critical— and there is nothing to criticize here. I guess that makes it perfect. With the hype, I was ready to be underwhelmed— but it lives up to 15000 opinions of greatness.	4.9
119	Heady Topper	The can says “Drink from the can!” But given the limited supply I had to try both from the can and a glass. Neither was disappointing. The flavor has an artfully smoky taste and a clean finish. This is a beer I have been looking forward to and I was afraid the expectations would be tough to live up to This was not the case Find it and enjoy it.	4.87
120	Heady Topper	The best part to me is the intense smell you get when you open a can. I could just sniff this stuff all day straight out the can. It’s suddenly become more readily available in my area of the world over the past week or two. Overall a good beer!	4.98
121	Heady Topper	Although I generally prefer west coast IPAs, this was an amazing beer. I resisted the temptation to pour it into a glass and instead enjoyed it directly from the can. Too bad Stowe is on the other side of the continent or I would plan to have another Heady soon!	4.39
122	Heady Topper	The quintessential DIPA. Hits all the marks you can think of wanting when you want a non-hazy hop monster. A nearly perfect beer.. Great color (I poured in a glass finally), pearl head with lots, lots, lots of legs. Smell is strong hops and citrus. Taste is wave after wave of hops, smooth bitter finish and refreshing. Thick rich body, but not chewy or excessive.. Timeless IMO. And way better than Pliny	4.78
123	Heady Topper	I am disappointed with this beer. I just don’t find that it lives up to the hype. Give me a Second Fiddle anytime. If you area fan of very bitter DIPA’s, this beer is for you. I love IPA’s and DIPA’s but I don’t care for this. It finishes like it was brewed with hockey pads.	3.18
124	Heady Topper	No canning date (bought at brewery on 3/8/19; presumably canned within a week or two prior). Pours a cloudy golden orange topped with a massive head of white fluff; spectacular head retention leaves a tapestry of thick, soapy lacing as well as a thick mound of frothy cap.. Aromas of dank orange peel, passionfruit, grapefruit rind, and sweaty pine all bursting from the forefront, with clean, crisp grainy malt bringing up the backbone; aggressive at first, but smooths out very nicely over time..  1,457 characters	4.44
125	King Julius	Review #800. Another incredible NE-style IPA from the always-amazing Tree House. If this one was disappointing at all, it’s only because it didn’t seem so extraordinary as to be one of the top 3 NE IPAs ever as rated on BA - but this was still an amazing brew nonetheless. Maybe I waited a little too long with this one - canned date 7/29/19, but I had wanted to wait to make this review #800. Looks wonderful, pours a nice, hazy orange-pale yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and glorious thick wide rings of lingering lacing that stayed throughout. Smells of very ripe fruit with food hoppiness - pineapple, guava, tangerine, mango, melon, grapefruit and passionfruit. Some nice aromas of malt, creamy vanilla, bread and then some more faint floral and dank notes in the background. Taste follows the nose, extremely well balanced and with good depth and complexity. Again a little dankness towards the finish especially as the beer warmed. Very well hidden higher ABV. Smooth, luscious, slightly sticky, fairly soft mouthfeel that coated the palate and was very juicy and easy to enjoy. Good amount of carbonation. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, just wish it could have had a little more power behind the bitter hops in order to tip the scales versus the solid malt backbone.	4.5
126	King Julius	Slightly orange and cloudy with a creamy slightly amber head. Totally opaque. Juicy fruit salad aroma. Flavor is straight orange with faint tropical notes. No bitterness whatsoever. Very clean, smooth, and easygoing. Would never know this is 8.3. Really delicious beer, though I prefer a little more depth and boldness. It’s a top-end beer to enjoy with your wife!	4.28
127	King Julius	"A: Turbid gold/yellow with thick head and thick foamy lacing.
N: Loads of juice/tropical, fresh citrus, reminds me a fresh cut fruit.
T: Follows the nose, big tropical hit with clean citrus, some malt and biscuit notes.
M: Creamy, smooth, soft, and low bite.
O: One of the best NEIPA I have had so far, this is the benchmark for others to hit. FANTASTIC STUFF"	4.82
128	King Julius	16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Hazy golden orange body, bit of a coppery hue, one finger frothy white head, good retention. Rings of lacing. Smell is overripe oranges, citrus and grapefruit; mildly sweet grainy malt with a touch of white sugar. A bit of yeast esters giving off a bit of fruitiness. Definitely a Julius based beer both on the smell and palate. The palate brings a nice sweet orange and citrus presence, light herbal and resin, grapefruit as well. It's pretty similar to Julius with the malt and hops both amplified a bit. Not too sweet, but not too dry or resinous either. I think it compares similarly to Julius, and of course the mouthfeel is perfect- soft, creamy carbonation, medium body, easy to drink with a nice juicy finish. Overall- for what it takes to get, it's not really worth it over regular Julius- which when it's on, will be on par with all the best NE IPAs out there- but it is an interesting take and/or evolution of the beer.	4.44
129	King Julius	Appearance - pours thick turbid dark orange with a huge orange white head excellent retention. Tons of sticky lacing.. Aroma - Nose is sweet candied orange, pineapple, citrus peel, mango strong overly ripe fruit.. Taste - Big peach, pineapple, wet hops, citrus peel and grapefruit. Big flavors balanced sweet and bitter..  504 characters	4.83
130	King Julius	16oz can. Pours a turbid bright yellowish orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Smells like a tropical fruit smoothie. Orange, mango, berries, pineapple and vanilla ice cream. Tastes like a creamsicle along with some mango, pineapple, peach and a bit of grapefruit. Peaches and cream finish with some bitter citrus peel. Soft with lots of carbonation and an oily mouthfeel. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence.	4.45
131	King Julius	"Canned on 7/26. Poured to TH IPA Glass on 8/12.
A:Very Hazy light Orange colour. Finger of cloud and remain sometime.
S:Strong Mango, tropical fruits aromas emitted immediately after open the can !
T:Strong fruits notes as well as very comfortable level of bitterness. Very sophisticated balance and comfortableness of harmony.
M:Creamy and fluffy. light Carbo, medium body. Quite smooth.
O:Great NEIPA. One of the best.
Julius sometimes remain sweetness in after taste. But King Julius's after taste is perfect.
Also, never felt 8.3% ABV. Just ""FLUFFY""."	4.78
132	King Julius	Absolutely magical! Hazy, gold pour, luscious white foam head, both citrus and tropical fruit flavors dancing in your mouth, and one of the longest, deepest and ever-changing aftertaste that you'll ever find in a beer. It has a sterling reputation, and earns it with every sip.	5
133	King Julius	King Julius, canned 07/26/19.. Look: Pours a hazey light gold color. Pillowy head with very compact bubbles.. Smell: Smells intensely of sweet overripe orange (almost like orange marmalade) and mango smoothie with some grapefruit. There are also notes of peach and papaya and pine/resin. You can definitely smell the booziness, which is a bit unusual for a TH beer. Very nice and complex smell!.  1,243 characters	4.94
134	King Julius	After relishing the true king of beers (Heady) i was in the same position as many, somewhat depressed I had peaked too soon. The. I went to Tree house and waited on line for Julius and many of his friends. The second I poured the Julius into my mouth I realized there was hope, it was legit and I just knew King Julius was going to be epic. Unfortunately it wasn’t available when I was there and I had to wait what felt like forever. A week later my buddy was in line and they announced a limited number of king Julius cans would be available. Three hours later I’m opening a can of heaven and the True King was born! The absolute smoothest DIPA on the planet, it’s like mixing a wicked NE DIPA with a cream sickle with some magic dust sprinkled in. Never a bad moment as it settles on your pallate, unfreakingbelievable!	5
135	King Julius	"Can stamped ""Warden of the North""
Canned 7/26/19
Golden murk trending towards beige, darker opaque than Julius
Quickly dissipating white fine head, spotty lacing and cap
Strong intoxicating orange, tropical, apricot, pineapple scents
Even more juicy orange, mango, grapefruit pith, light hop pine note
Smooth rich mouthfeel, hop tang at the end, sticky, medium carbonation, additional citrus aftertaste, pleasant hop bitterness, no alcohol heat
Unique"	4.9
136	King Julius	The King in the North. Take Julius and crank it up a few notches on the flavor profile. Where Julius shines, KJ shines just a bit brighter. The smell is intoxicating and amazing. Immediately after opening the can the room is bursting with tropical hops. The term orange creamsicle and mango smoothie are apt descriptions by them.	4.84
137	King Julius	Pours an opaque white-orange with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, mango, nectarine and orange, with a very dense, bountiful tropical fruit make-up. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, nectarine, orange and mandarin orange with smooth and dynamic playfulness between tropical fruits. It's dense and flavorful, without ever coming across ultra-sugary or sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft and pillowy texture that welcomes the tongue. Overall, hearty tropical fruits with a splendid sweetness meets pillowy soft textures for a delightful brew.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can.	4.75
138	King Julius	Big thanks to Stofko1992 for sharing this one with me! The King pours out as a hazy orange color with a nice white head on top. Decent retention and scattered lacing. Notes of orange creamsicle and subtle pine on the nose. The taste has a piney resin punch up front that fades into a silky orange vanilla cream finish. The feel is smooth and kind of lingers for awhile which is nice. Overall it’s a solid beer and was great to finally try it.	4.43
139	King Julius	It’s not the prettiest beer in the world.. looks like muddy pineapple juice. Hop sediment gets caught in the tight head. Smells like you plunged your head into freshly crushed hops. Crazy, pithy citrus aromas, pineapple and vanilla.	4.33
140	King Julius	I am lucky enough to live within driving distance of Treehouse, so this is actually not a hard beer for me to enjoy. If you know that hoppy-grape bubblegum smell that hits you when you approach the Treehouse doors, that's what this smells like.. I am not a fan of juicy IPA ... I prefer the citrus/pine/resin style. Oddly, I'd leave a Julius if offered one however King Julius isn't as juice forward which is probably why I love it. It lacks that sweet pineapple, pulpy orange juice flavor of a juicy IPA and adds some piney lemon. It's like a hazy version of Sip of Sunshine.. I love everything about this beer, from the smell to the taste. I just wish it packed a stronger buzz factor, for some reason after 2 I am not feeling much whereas one or two cans of many Treehouse offerings make me feel light and fuzzy. Usually there is a 2-4 can limit so even those who live close by to TH will ration this stuff. This to me is what a great IPA is.	5
141	King Julius	L - orange color, murky body. S - Slightly bigger than standard Julius. T - Orange sherbet, orange cream, cream soda, dank hop juice.  209 characters	4.77
142	King Julius	"Sampling a cellar temp 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a bright white bleached head of 1 cm that foams up even with a gentle pour. The foam fades away to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour. There is some windowpane lacing on the sides of my glass after each sip.
The aroma is fairly bold and is expected for the style and beer. Lots of citrusy notes with orange and tangerine notes.
The first sip reveals a fairly light creamy textured body with fine yet slightly prickly carbonation. Easy drinking brew so far.
Flavor is citrus again, with orange and some mango notes mixing again. I also get a little bit of grapefruit rind bitterness on the finish. There is no hint of any booze and the beer is very easy to drink. Im glad to have enjoyed this one and would recommend it to folks that are really into the NEIPA scene, but Im not sure Ill chase this one next time"	4.27
143	King Julius	Tasted from can. Pours murky orange with thick orange head. Huge citrus and orange aroma. Super well balanced crushable IPA. Citrus flavors dominate. Goes down way too easy.	4.89
144	King Julius	Not to say it's bad in any way but when a beer has the hype this has I just felt let down. Smooth and good body but kind of had an over ripe fruit dankness to it that just didnt land great for me. Checked off the bucket list.	3.9
145	King Julius	Fully opaque maize-tan with a large fluffy white head settling to a persistent film and chunky collar.. Taste is orange and papaya with a tangy green hoppy zip, almost like mint. A hint of Nilla wafer leans in before a lightly sharp, acidic swallow.. The frothy body is round and full but quickly rushes into an overwhelmingly chewy, chalk dry finish..  436 characters	4
146	King Julius	"Fresh can, Orange straw, fully hazed. Big fluffy head.
Aroma is big full force citrus. OJ and layers of fruit.
Flavor is orange juice, citrus zest, fresh tropical hoppy fruit. Not crazy sweet, nice balance.
Soft and smooth with moderate carbonation and medium body.
Met my somewhat high expectations. Have had mixed feelings about some highly rated Tree House, but this was excellent"	4.6
147	King Julius	Pours a deep gold with a close to full haze can see slightly through the edges of the beer. The aroma is a wonderful tropical citrus medley of candied orange peel, mango, peach and grapefruit. The flavor follows the nose with a burst of tropical citrus candy up front, thankfully not cloying, with a great piney, green resinous bitterness which makes for a great contrast to the candied tropical flavors. The mouthfeel is a light density and medium viscosity with a slightly astringent finish. Wonderful beer that I wish more people could experience without the hype, but thankfully it does a solid job of living up to it and I’m pumped I finally got to try it.	4.63
148	King Julius	Tasty yet predictable NEIPA... they're starting to all taste the same. This one has good aroma and flavor, not elite. Drinks a little muddy and yeasty but still quite enjoyable	4.19
149	King Julius	Very cloudy straw-orange appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a prominent grapefruit that is slightly tangy. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit with a tangy touch.	4.75
150	Pliny The Younger	This small batch IPA I've only had a few times. Each time its a from a small pony keg that I heard through the grape vine while living in San Diego that a bar had it. It is excellent. I wish they would bottle it but I understand why they don't.	4.75
151	Pliny The Younger	"10 oz pour on tap at SD Taproom in Pacific Beach. Pours a near clear honey golden with 1 finger white head. Aroma is hop forward - pine resin, grapefruit, but with enough balancing malty sweetness and hints of mango, tropical fruit.
Taste aggressive hops - resinous, sticky pine, grapefruit pith but with great balance of malt that keeps it sweet and drinkable - touches of ripe pineapple, tropical fruit.
Mouthfeel is medium full with oily sticky pine resin, lingering mild hop bitterness but not overdone. Certainly benefits from the anticipation and hype but all said this is a world class beer and an absolute treat at 1030 on a Saturday morning - or anytime."	4.55
152	Pliny The Younger	I am so used to the cloudy IPAs from the northeast that it was refreshing to see a great clear complex tasting IPA different from the pack. Not just different but worth the wait in line to taste something within a 2 week window of the year. The only attribute which did not exceed was the smell and although there was a tempered bouquet like a new wine it got better after a few sips.	4.82
153	Pliny The Younger	Would have loved to have had this one eight years ago when there weren't so many great DIPA and TIPAs on the market as I'm sure it would've shined. As is, it's a good West Coast hoppy beer but not heads above many other similar offerings. It did hide the alcohol very well and drink much smoother than a 10% beer. Enjoyable and glad I was able to try it.	4
154	Pliny The Younger	Mission accomplished! I was finally able to have Pliny the Younger. This is a piney, extreme tropical hoppiness bomb on the nose! Taste follows with a very smooth finish. This felt more like a DIPA than a TIPA. It has a subdued bitterness on the finish and hides the alcohol very well. For my palate, I think I actually prefer Pliny the Elder to this one, though. Still very, very good and worth the wait to try it!	4.72
155	Pliny The Younger	"Soft straw with a hint of haze, moderate carbonation and a thin skim of white head.. The smell is of papayas, mangos, peaches, pears and a hint of pine. The fresh hulled malts are amazingly present as well.. The smell follows the nose, and becomes more of a perfectly balanced. Shredded tropical fruit salad, with a hint of dankness and pine. The sweet and fresh milled porridge is very present as well. A grapefruit pith bitterness ends the and lingers on the tongue, and the tastebuds then say ""Repeat."".  1,306 characters"	4.24
156	Pliny The Younger	Had on tap at Windsor after a 50 minute wait (2pm on Tuesday 12 days into the release.) Well worth the wait.. Look was gold, aroma golden, taste the gold standard. Citrus, a bit of pine and some bitterness on the finish but overall so well balanced that it fits. The alcohol is very well hidden — easily could pass for a DIPA. The world has moved on to hazy juice bombs but it’s hard to beat a Pliny.	5
157	Pliny The Younger	"L: Liquid, buttery gold! It’s looks like you’re about to drink something very special.
S: The moment our server put the glass on the table (at least several feet away), all I could smell was Hops!
T: Absolute perfection! It’s like what a beer should be. Aggressive hops, aggressive maltiness, a hint of sweet booze and just a lot of balance.
M: Crisp and refreshing. Can’t really say more because I’m too focused on the taste.
O: I loved this beer the first time I had it, after a seven hour wait! Six years later, the waits have become shorter, and the competition has become fierce (except for haze... hazy IPAS Suck!), but Pliny the Younger still stands on top! A must have if you can get it!"	5
158	Pliny The Younger	On tap at the new Windsor location. A fairly hazy bright golden color with a frothy white head. There was a bright aroma smelled on the pour - piney with some citrus and stone fruit mixed in. The taste met my high expectations: bright pine, modest citrus, and floral, stone fruit blended in a wonderful drink. An assertive bitterness that was clean with a dry finish. Very drinkable and smooth with a well-hidden double-digits ABV. Exceptional and it lived up to the hype.	4.64
159	Pliny The Younger	Definitely a solid IPA. Extremely well balanced. Hue is orange, and taste carries hints of citrus and pineapple. Very drinkable beer at 10.5 ABV. My tasting notes are based on a keg event in Philadelphia.	4.23
160	Pliny The Younger	The hand of god has came down to a certain individual and said make this and you will win. Nothing more to say than this is godsend. 4.75 on the nose cause nothing is perfect.	4.83
161	Pliny The Younger	Tasted from draft. Checking off a whale. Pours a partially cloudy gold. Aroma is piney, medicinal, floral. Moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of pine, resin, citrus, herbal and earthy. Complex and goes down super smooth. Awesome imperial ipa.	4.48
162	Pliny The Younger	Amazing beer, elder is better. Smooth all the way. Notes of pine and flowers (sorry not sure what kind). Taste is great along the way, needs to be served cold because the hops tend to get a little dull with warmth	4.56
163	Pliny The Younger	Tried it on tap at Haven Gastropub in Orange, CA. Crystal clear gold with a slight head. Good carbonation. Taste was very hop forward with notes of citrus and pine, followed with a light malty sweetness, and ending in a boozey bite. The alcohol content definitely shines through. Overall a very good triple IPA, but I feel that the alcohol holds it back. What makes Pliny the Elder so good is the balance of flavors, which is lost in the Younger. Worth a try for sure, but if you can get either the Elder or Blind Pig regularly, you are not missing much if you don't.	4.27
164	Pliny The Younger	"Was at this years event (2018) .
For a triple IPA i thought it was the best tripe IPA that i have had .At 10% ABV the alcohol was hidden so well.
I spoke with many who have had years of Younger and they said that this years was top notch with a great selection of hops for 2018.
Great beer and good times."	4.74
165	Pliny The Younger	A fluffy persistent off-white head rests upon a shimmering light gold body.. The aroma is super dank and crackery, while very much reminding me of Hop Juju, with plenty of accents of orange and lemon. There is a hint of veg, but it's really sticky icky compared to Elder.. Taste is Triple Sec with a good bite of pine, orange liqueur and spikes of sticky cannabis and allium. The medium-light body has a semi dry tingle and no indication of its high ABV..  827 characters	4.05
166	Pliny The Younger	On tap at City Tap House- Logan Square in Philadelphia, PA.. This one pours a nearly 100% clear golden yellow, with a small foamy white head, and lots of lacing.. This one smells like orange and grapefruit zest, slightly sweet malt, pine resin, floral hops, and vague citrus..  1,269 characters	4.43
167	Pliny The Younger	"A-Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing
A-Aroma has fruity and pine hints
T-The taste follows the nose with fruity and pine flavors
M-A medium bodied well carbonated beer
O-A great beer!"	5
168	Pliny The Younger	"On tap at SD Taproom during their 11th anniversary celebration on 02/24/18.
Lots of tropical aromas that lead to a pleasant mixture of tropical, floral and pine hop flavors. I've waited quite a while to try this & was not disappointed."	4.49
169	Pliny The Younger	The color was a golden yellow, smell was citrusy with a bit of piney-ness and taste was smooth. It lacks the typical bitterness that comes as a smack to the face with triple IPAs. All-in-all, it was delicious. I liked smelling it as much as I liked tasting it.	4.38
170	Pliny The Younger	Stood in line, being alone jumped me up a bit. Small, bright golden pour, small, scant head. Piney, hoppy aroma, flavor blossoms with resinous hoppy bitterness, ABV comes in late with a wallop. First sip was meh, but it gets better with each one. Scratch this off the bucket list.	4.33
171	Pliny The Younger	A President’s day Miracle! On draft at LadyFace Alehouse, Agoura Hills, CA.. Pours a slightly hazy deep golden yellow. Nice creamy white head with sticky lace retention.. Amazing balance on the nose. Pine, citrus, malt all coming together for aromas that aren’t too sweet but aren’t too bitter..  841 characters	4.96
172	Pliny The Younger	Finally tracked it down at Tonys Darts Away in Burbank, CA. It is definitely the best IPA I've ever had, and IPA is my favorite style, so I suppose it's the best beer I've ever had.. I wouldn't say it reaches perfection, despite surpassing all other beers--a realization that applies not just to beer, but to all of life. You expect a life-changing experience, and you get reality: an unrivaled, expertly crafted IPA that makes you wonder why they can't all be done this way. It seems so simple and obvious that it fails to be life changing. That's not its fault.. PtY pour a hazy golden with a nice creamy head that leaves sticky lacing behind as it slowly settles. The aroma is strong and fresh, with mango, passionfruit, grapefruit rind, pine, and a bit of caramel malt clearly coming through. The taste is very hop forward but extremely balanced, reflecting the above notes along with a bit of alcohol spice and a nice malt backbone that has both a dry cracker-like quality and some caramel sweetness. It is clean from front to back and finishes with a nice fresh dryness that doesn't linger too long. The body doesn't strike me as full or creamy or syrupy, but solidly medium and slightly resinous with just the right amount of carbonation..  1,842 characters	4.89
173	Pliny The Younger	Finally found it. Orange gold with a fair bit of haze which surprised me. Elder certainly has no haze. Big aroma of fruit, fantastic. Fruit flavor doesn't come over in the taste as much as I was expecting more floral and Piney. Huge hoppy finish. Ridiculously smooth for a triple ipa. Most triple ipas i have had seem to throw hops in to throw hops in. This seems to have been carefully crafted for sure. All in all a huge fantastic beer and worth the hype in my opinion.	4.81
174	Pliny The Younger	"So smooth and so intense - lupulin galore. First sip was so intense and smooth at the same time, makes your throat tingle from the obvious density of flavor and amount of ingredients going into this brew.
Pineapple and pine, grapefruit, flotal character, and a definite heavy presence of alcohol but it comes across as heat instead of a ethanol flavor component.
Amazing thick mouthfeel without feeling syrupy. Hop oils fall slowly off the tongue. Finish is long, citrusy, and slightly sweet with a bready maltiness that helps carry the abv heat.. Drank every drop of my 3 10oz. servings I was allotted."	4.7
175	Mornin' Delight	Poured into a 5 oz taster on tap at a special release. Pours thick and black with very little head or carbonation. Smell is nice coffee aroma with maple tones on back. Taste is bitter coffee supported by deep rich caramel and chocolate malt and sweet syrup notes. Body leans to the malt thick side but drinkable for a big beer.. I’m not sure this is the world class beer these rankings indicate, but it is really good.	4.5
176	Mornin' Delight	Oh my goodness ! This may be my new top beer !! Coffee flavor with stout is mixing so well. Very nice mouth feel, dang, this is almost perfect !! Totally different style but it definitely going to rival Piraat for my number !. Only had a sample in the tap room, but I bought plenty of large cans to enjoy ! Not easy drink though, more on the serious side to drink slowly and enjoy. On high side of alcohol.	4.75
177	Mornin' Delight	"Pours pitch black. No head, but there's a ring of a residue from the head around the glass.
Coffee is really strong an pleasing on the nose. Deep and rich. There's vanilla notes, and chocolate. Just spot on.
Taste - wow! This is perfect. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate. Maple syrup. Just amazingly good.
Thick bodied. Smooth. Slightly warming, no alcohol burn at all.
This beer is worth the hype. Must try beer."	4.92
178	Mornin' Delight	2019 bottle. Poured highly viscous motor oil with a beige head that disappeared quickly. The aromas is heavy in rich sweet maple. Just a little coffee in the background as well as vanilla. The taste is precisely the same. Mega doses of sweet maple. The coffee comes in but more like an afterthought, gives a mocha flavor with vanilla and some cocoa. I find this stout sweet, decadent as well as robust. It lends a nice full bodied mouthfeel with no alcohol warmth. Overall: it provides massive amounts of maple. Yes its no doubt a breakfast stout but I do kinda wish there was more coffee to help balanced out the sweetness. But nonetheless, this is a spectacular stout!	4.5
179	Mornin' Delight	Pours a dark brown with tan head. Immediately, you can smell the maple and coffee, like a cafe with freshly ground beans. It smells really good. It's sweet with plenty of maple and coffee character. There is also a bit of bitterness on the finish. The pour I got was 5 oz. I think that's where this really suffers. It's a beer that you only want a little of. You can tell it's well-made as it's measured in its use of adjuncts. It's good.	4.25
180	Mornin' Delight	Catching up on lots of historical check ins. This was a nice bottle with great flavor and mouthfeel but respectfully, having had it three times in a couple of months it's simply good beer - not worth the hype.	4.25
181	Mornin' Delight	Bottle poured into tulip.. Dark and syrupy, almost pitch black. Mocha colored head is thick, foamy, and slow to dissipate. It leaves some clingy mocha lacing and a cappuccino collar.. Aroma is roasty coffee over sweet and woody maple. A hint of floral vanilla..  616 characters	4.38
182	Mornin' Delight	Batch 2. Bottled 8/26/15; drank 10/20/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Black appearance.. Minimal dark khaki head; minimal lace..  393 characters	4.49
183	Mornin' Delight	"Batch 5 poured into a mornin' delight teku. L - pours a beautiful think black and leaves to a two finger coffee colored head l. Minimal coffee colored lacing around the rim of the glass.
S - as described. Coffee, maple syrup, vanilla. Some bitterness from roasted malts, and maybe some astringency from the coffee
T - follows the nose. Maple dominates with coffee and vanilla as second flavors. Sweet roastiness, mild coffee astringency. The astringency comes out more as this warms.
F - think in the tounge and lingers. Near perfect, just a little over carbonated in my opinion
O - A maple syrup, coffee and vanilla ice cream in the glass. Excellent. I think this is better closer to 40 degrees."	4.53
184	Mornin' Delight	Cracked it open.... eventually. This bottle had the worst, hardest, most annoying wax I've ever seen. I literally tore the bottle cap in two pulling it off of the bottle. Anyway, when I did tear the cap, the smell that burst out in my face was incredible. This might be the best smelling beer I've ever smelled. Basically smelled like I had a cup of good coffee and a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup right in front of me. Some vanilla and chocolate in the smell too. They should make a Mornin' Delight air freshener, I would buy it.. The taste was really good, but not as great as the smell. The coffee was almost overwhelmingly strong. I didn't get a lot of other tasting notes because the coffee dominated so much. The maple was mostly an aftertaste. Great if you like coffee (which I do). A little thinner than I expected, but not enough for it to be a negative. Drinks really well.. Overall: really good, one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had. My only issue is that the other stouts I think are comparable with Mornin' Delight are like 1/3 the price (maybe less).	4.58
185	Mornin' Delight	Saved this for a very special occasion and unfortunately did not enjoy it. Thinner than described by others and too roasty. Definitely was getting a strong green-peppery thing going on.	3.06
186	Mornin' Delight	On tap. Poured an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of rich, roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla and toffee. Nice bitter coffee taste without being overpowering. Nice vanilla, chocolate and caramel.	4.6
187	Mornin' Delight	At last, finally got to try one of the vaunted stouts from T.G. Now for what was honestly expected. Is it a great coffee stout? Yes. Is it a top 10 beer in the world? No chance. Now that we have gotten the hype proceedings out of the way, this is a decadent stout with layers of bakers chocolate, maple, molasses, praline, vanilla, pecan, smooth malt, and of course dark coffee. The smell features all of the taste flavors, but does so in the prism of the coffee, and adds some dark fruit too, amazing. Feel is worthy of the hype as well, with full and lush dark nature, but not overly sweet or heavy.	4.64
188	Mornin' Delight	Pours pitch black. Dark mocha head. Decadent. Great breakfast beer but having as a dessert instead. Coffee and maple blend so well together. Sweet but not overpowering. Thickkkk.	4.81
189	Mornin' Delight	2018 Bottle opened Jan 2019. A: Very smooth coffee, sweet molasses, vanilla, maple, and mellow roasted malts. Very full and smooth but remains nicely balanced and not overboard. Perfect.. A: opaque black with medium brown head that quickly falls to a nice ring around the glass..  795 characters	4.73
190	Mornin' Delight	Had this on tap during the 12-15-18 KBBS release. Excellent aroma and flavor. A maple beast! In my opinion this is every bit as good as KBBS. When factoring in the acquisition costs, Mornin' Delight is a no brainer.	4.83
191	Mornin' Delight	B5 poured into a snifter. Pretty good beer a bit overhyped. Smell was amazing right when the bottle got cracked would have pegged it a 4.75 but in the glass it's a 4.25 even after warming up the maple didn't pop like I would have hoped. Maple is there and pretty well rounded with the coffee I just was expecting more. Yes it's in the top 3 coffee stouts I've ever had actually this reminds me a lot of coffee shop vibes with maple. Wouldn't go too far out of my way to find this again considering this was supposedly a great batch.	4.2
192	Mornin' Delight	Pours deep black and thick! Smells amazing and rich!! That first taste tickles every taste bud on your tongne and mouth! Wow! Amazing flavor; certainly a slow, sippy beer. Enjoyed two pours of this at the Field Museum in Chicago! Pricey but worth every $. It was everything I’d hoped for. Heavy maple syrup and chocolate tastes it’s the best I’ve ever had! Want KBBS do bad! But heard this is the Real Deal, same powerful flavor and punch, but not as sweet! My only comparison is SR-71, it’s easily as powerful and delightful, just with a much less sweet flavor to it. Had Sr-71 on tap at the Decorah taproom. Amazing! World class for sure! Love this!! Can’t wait to try it again. Must try both!	5
193	Mornin' Delight	"Absolute perfection. Was like drinking a warm, boozy bottle of maple syrup. Many beers claim to have maple syrup in it, but rarely deliver. This beer does. Though the maple is the star, closely behind is the quality of the base beer. What a treat. Every ""maple"" beer since trying this has been hard to live up to."	5
194	Mornin' Delight	From 9/2/17. 2016 vintage, poured in a snifter. Awesome maple tone without being overly sweet, coffee had zero bitterness or harshness. Great balance of the two with a thick, motor oil viscosity. Better than most BA stouts I have had. Just excellent!	4.82
195	Mornin' Delight	Fantastic dynamic taste between blended flavors of coffee and maple. Extremely balanced, thick, rich, and aromatic. Only complaint is that it is super sticky and I was basically licking my lips the whole time I was drinking it. MD b5 on draft at Field Museum, woooopp!!	4.8
196	Mornin' Delight	Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Good head retention. Aroma is maple syrup, dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, and medium roast coffee. Roasted and toasted malts. Kiss of char. Flavor profile is maple syrup, milk and dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, and char. Roasted and toasted malts throughout. It's thick and filling, with a velvety texture. Overall, absolutely sublime coffee and maple syrup over a thick and soupy stout with power.. Served in a 6oz tulip from a 12oz bottle.	4.75
197	Mornin' Delight	"Drank on tap at The Publick House, Brookline, MA
Served in a stemmed tasting glass. The dense, near pitch black liquid was topped by a small, creamy, mocha colored crown that transformed into a thick, clingy collar. Spotty lacing trickled down the glass.. The aroma was amazingly fragrant. Maple syrup notes came through big time. Rich and robust Grade B maple syrup perhaps. Malty and moderately roasty. There was an intense creamed coffee presence as well. Caramel notes were also quite apparent. Sweet but not excessively so..  1,403 characters"	4.8
198	Mornin' Delight	Batch 5 out of the bottle:. This thing poured super dark brown with a consistency almost akin to motor oil. Very small head that quickly disappeared. Lots of dark brown lacing that just stuck to the sides of the glass. This thing is a maple bomb. As soon as you open the bottle, the aroma of maple fills the immediate area. I thought that Double Stack smelled like breakfast, but this beer buries that one. Huge notes of sweet cream, vanilla, roasted coffee and caramel. The taste is all of that turned to 11. There are also some dark fruit flavors. This made the taste seem even more like a liquefied stack of pancakes. This is a sweet beer, but I never found it cloying. I drank an entire 22oz bottle, and could've kept going. This taste and super thick feel made this such an enjoyable experience. Seriously, carbonation is low, and this coats your mouth so well you think you're drinking a barrel aged beer. In fact, I think I would've only been able to enjoy this more is if it had been barrel aged. If KBBS is truly the BA version of this, I'll try my hardest to get myself a bottle of that if it's released again. So well executed.	4.96
199	Mornin' Delight	"Poured on tap into snifter at the brewery.
A: Pours a super dark brown with thin skim of dark mocha head.
S: Strong maple syrup with dark chocolate, smooth medium roast coffee, and a hint of bacon (?!).
T: Follows aroma with strong maple syrup with smooth dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, and hints of molasses and sweet tobacco.
M: Medium heavy body...lighter than expected. Darkly sweet with maple syrup. The excellent balance keeps this from veering out of control. Unbelievably velvety smooth.
D: A superb brew...best I’ve had with maple syrup notes. Well done again, TG!"	4.54
200	Very Hazy	16oz can, dated 09.11.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 9.21.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a super hazy and turbid golden color, bright with lemon hues and a finger of white head, moderate retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is incredible, huge burst of peach nectar, juicy valencia orange, mango puree, light pineapple, super floral and inviting with some more bitter pine and soft dough with a sweet yeast. The flavors are just as great, oozing with juicy hops, soft sweet peach with snappy orange, mango and pineapple with a more pronounced grassiness, bitter pine, weedy and dank with just a kiss of yeast and grain. The mouthfeel is great, coating, lively yet creamy with an easy medium body and a mellow but dry finish.. Verdict: An incredible IPA from Tree House. Just bursting with delicious hops and yet it doesn't become too sweet or too raw, it just hits the mark in every way. Stunning beer.	4.76
201	Very Hazy	Pale Hazy color. Smell is absolutely amazing - full of passion fruit and citrus. Some bitterness and a great long lasting beer head that's white in color.	4.77
202	Very Hazy	16oz can poured into a snifter.. A: Dull golden color, completely opaque with haze. Two fingers of bone white head retain very well. Webby lacing.. S: Potent stone fruit aroma. Tons of peach and star fruit. White grapefruit, candied lemon, melon rind. Doughy and yeasty underneath..  1,581 characters	4.68
203	Very Hazy	"Blown away by this beer. Hazy orange juice in appearance with a lingering lacey head. Aromas of tangerine, sappy citrus and pine, lemon, and caramel candy.
Taste is so juicy, orange and grapefruit, a chewy mouthfeel with a silkiness that belies it’s strength. A tinge of bitterness with grapefruit pith. Tons of intense flavours that are perfectly balanced, this is the good stuff. Wow! Incredible"	4.87
204	Very Hazy	"A: The beer is very hazy cloudy yellow in color. It poured with a short white head.
S: Strong aromas of grapefruit and currants are present in the nose.
T: The taste has flavors of currants along with notes of grapefruit.
M: It feel medium-bodied and very juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: I really liked the juicy, juicy, juicy nature of the mouthfeel.. Serving type: can"	4.71
205	Very Hazy	Very cloudy dark straw appearance with nice white head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is a very pleasant grapefruit. Taste is also a very pleasant and smooth grapefruit.	4.75
206	Very Hazy	Haze has always been my favorite Treehouse beer. I finally got some Very Hazy and I can say without reservation it is the most delicious IPA I have ever had the pleasure of tasting!	5
207	Very Hazy	"Canned on 9/11. Poured to Glass on 9/24. One can only per person on 9/20 ! But I was lucky.
A:Hazy light Orange. Finger of the clouds.
S: Strong sweet and fruity, like mango aromas.
T: Fluffy, creamy but smooth balance of tastes. Bomb of tropical fruits notes with great harmony with Hops bitterness.
M:Medium body, light Carbo.Felt like a smoothie or nectar but easy to drink. No stickiness.
O: Great DIPA. Like a lot. Never felt 8.6% alcohol existence.
ABV: 8.6%"	4.76
208	Very Hazy	My work schedule allowed that I was near Worcester and i finished many meeting at 10:30 and I could manage a visit to treeHouse. Pulled in to the lot at 11:15 and was out of there by plenty of variety including Very Hazy, a top 10 Beer Advocate beer.. The reviews state it is “a kicked up version of Haze-with even greater depth and potency. Pungent grapefruit notes greet your palate while an underlying current of soft tropical fruit dances in the background. Just the right amount of bitterness balances the sweet fruit flavors while a velvety soft mouthfeel make you easily (and dangerously!) forget this one clocks in at 8.6% ABV.”. Canned 9/11/19.  1,272 characters	4.78
209	Very Hazy	Peaches and mangos for days. Aroma is dried mango and peach rings. Taste follows. Peach flavor is dominant throughout. Starts with That peach ring that transitions into honey mango. There is balancing green mango and grapefruit pith bitterness to counteract the sweet fruit flavors. it finishes dry with pith and on the long the peach remains. Overall a great showcase of what TH does	5
210	Very Hazy	"Canned 07/10/19, 11:16:30, ""PEACHES & CREAM"".. Poured into my gold-rimmed Tree House teku glass. Awesome opaque golden haze. The head is soft and white, rising to about a half finger above the body of the beer. Fizzy carbonation rises quickly, but not quick enough to counteract the quickly falling bubbles. The lacing is essentially non-existent, struggling to cling for even a brief moment to the inside of the glass.. The nose is a symphony of tropical fruit, all perfectly balanced. Present aromas of mango, peach, pineapple, and guava. As it has some time to open up a bit further, an added level of complexity emerges as aromas of cantaloupe & sugar-coated grapefruit join the party..  1,517 characters"	4.91
211	Very Hazy	More straw haze than many of the TH pulpy orange juice look but pleasant enough pour with small head formed. In your face smells of big ripe fruit like pineapple and honeydew. Lot's of complex notes on the palate with pineapple returning coupled with grapefruit, straw, more melon and that ever present wet hops. The alcohol is a little more present than I expected or even wanted and that keeps my scoring on the lower side of the spectrum. I've been more impressed with other TH quaffs.	4.38
212	Very Hazy	16 oz can dated 7/10/19. Won in charity auction (you don't want to know). Consumed immediately. Three weeks old isn't too bad.. L: 2F pillowy white head with good retention and a lasting cap and ring. Beer is a bronzey gold.. S: More tropical than citrus. Lots of mango and pineapple, some grapefruit. Nice amount of earthiness..  865 characters	4.5
213	Very Hazy	16oz can. Poured out a very hazy, thick orange color with a small, off-white head of foam. It smelled of pineapple, grapefruit, mango and guava with sweet caramel. So tropical and fruity with toasted caramel and a sharp bitterness.	4.76
214	Very Hazy	"16 oz can fresh (can stamped July 10, 2019)
poured a dark turbid orange
Smelled strongly of ripe tropical fruit
Taste followed smell
Very creamy mouthfeel
Bottom of can was stamped ""Peaches and Cream"" and that probably best describes it."	4.7
215	Very Hazy	I am not as impressed as I thought I would be given the ratings. Honestly, if I had to choose this or Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine, I'd pick Lawson's. I guess I was expecting something more robust and strong tasting ... this is as smooth as silk but maybe a bit too fruit cocktail-y for me.. On first sip, there is zero IPA bite. It has no bitterness and almost undetectable resin taste. The notes which most stand out to me are grapefruit (the pulpy red inner ... not the peel as this isn't bracingly citrus), cantaloupe and honeydew mellon and passion fruit. It's kind of weak flavored but perhaps the smoothness and drinkability is what the fuss is all about. These go down a little too easy for a beer with almost 9% ABV. Seriously ... I'd never believe this was as high by the taste.. The smell is weak for Treehouse. Once it hits the glass, it's gone. Heady Topper's instructions are to drink from the can to preserve the scent. Maybe this is true here too. The mouthfeel is plush and creamy. Slight white head with a straw yellow/light orange color. You know it's a Treehouse just by looking at it..  1,428 characters	4.19
216	Very Hazy	TREE HOUSE VERY HAZY DIPA 7/13/19. Acquired at the brewery two days ago.. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip..  684 characters	4.63
217	Very Hazy	Call me crazy - but my first experience with Very Hazy was not a particularly overwhelming one.. I love Hazy. It was the first Tree House beer that really blew me away. It has only fairly recently been replaced by Alter Ego as my favorite Tree House IPA - maybe my favorite IPA of all, actually. My expectations for Very Hazy were, thus, pretty high. Add to that the hype factor and the insane ratings on every beer site out there.. But I didn't find the nose or the taste to be particularly stellar. It has a slightly more complex, layered flavor to it, versus the base beer, but I didn't feel like the overall product had elevated itself above the base. It's sweet and lightly malty, juicy, hazy, and smells nicely floral - but it just doesn't taste as great as Haze..  980 characters	4.18
218	Very Hazy	From can after having a Hazy can.. Tropical aroma. Fuller feel and bigger depth of flavor than regular Hazy (which is already a great beer). This one has a bit of a nice hop bite at the end.	4.92
219	Very Hazy	In the glass, it's that beautiful Treehouse orange. Not too dark, and not too light, but definitely hazy and dense. Smell is sweet, creamy, and peachy, with ripe mango, and a little bit of citrus. Beautiful mouthfeel, dare I say, perfectly carbonated, with a lovely, smooth finish. They've got the fluffy juiciness really dialed in. Taste is fruit and magic but by no means too sweet. As with most Treehouse brews, the sweetness sneaks off-stage at some point during your sip, and everything ends on a very balanced note. An amazing beer.	4.4
220	Very Hazy	The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head that recedes quickly. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of peach, grape, blueberry, and candy. It tastes of peach, grape, blueberry, and candy. It has a medium body. An excellent IPA from Tree House, one of the best.	4.64
221	Very Hazy	16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. Shared by schen9303.. Looks like pulpy orange juice. Nose is citrus, mango, papaya and melon. The brightest and dankest of tropical fruits. Super aromatic and fresh. Beer opens clementine, mango and overripe cantaloupe. Super juicy but not overly sweet. Nice balance of acidity and really soft around the edges. Finishes dry with a lingering orange and slight touch of ruby red. These beers are why Tree House is the best in the style. Body is light with moderate to low carbonation. Soft and fluffy on the palate and goes down crisp and clean with a dry finish. Incredibly drinkable.. Really really good. What impresses me about these beers are not so much the aroma or flavor, but the incredible mouthfeel on them. So soft and fluffy, more so than any other brewery I've come across.	4.45
222	Very Hazy	Poured from can dated 4-13-18 on 5/6/18. Pour an opaque darker yellow with small white head. Real strong citrus noes on the aroma, that burst into my nostrils even upon the opening of the can. Very smooth and creamy on the palate, with very little bitterness to speak of. I've had quite a bit of Tree House, and this can really brought me back to my first experience with the brewery. Well done!	5
223	Very Hazy	"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a Tree House teku
05/02/18. Cloudy, pale straw yellow appearance. The turbid body was capped by a tight, frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that slowly dropped to a thick, lasting collar. Streaky, spotty lacing stuck along the glass.. The aroma was pretty disappointing initially. I had a difficult time getting much of anything out of this. Smooth, citrusy hops were noticeable. Perhaps some juicy orange notes. Not much else though. As the beer sat, ripe honeydew melon appeared. Some peach as well. The orange notes intensified. Orange sherbet came to mind. The honeydew really came forth as well. Bit of weedy dankness too. Pretty spectacular by the drink’s end..  1,586 characters"	4.52
224	Very Hazy	Fully opaque dark tan, verging into brown territory, with a large, dense and lumpy beige foam that is slow to settle. Having this side by side with regular Haze, the head is less active and tall, but of similar hue, and Haze's body is a bit lighter, but still in the tan to yellow area.. The aroma is spicier, but also has a notable presence of peaches & cream topped shortbread with oats. It smells like a delightful, fattening fruity dessert.. If I'm being honest, I'm not finding drastic differences between this and regular Haze--the flavor of VH is perceptibly spicier, sharper, maybe a little more bitter, with all sorts of added evergreen, even eucalyptus and mint, and a more dry, thin feel. But like I said, it's not drastic, and Haze is just all around more drinkable, with a lighter, rounder, softer feel and a less potent but still delicious mix of dank and tropical juicy flavors. The abundance of hops in VH can build to an almost aspiriny astringency when you go for a larger swig, making it kind of acidic, but it's not as overboard as the Very Greens or Juice Machines I've had in the past.	3.98
225	King JJJuliusss	"Take King Julius and and it up. Pours a a slight orange hue aromas of orange and grapefruit.
Tropical, but not sweet, taste with slight bitterness in the middle. Long finish. No booziness. Epic."	5
226	King JJJuliusss	Poured from a can into a beer can shaped glass (odd selection I know). A beer that solidly matches the hype. This beer is everything I love about IPA. Wonderful mouthfeel, aroma, flavor. Amazing.	5
227	King JJJuliusss	From can into teku, less than a month from canning.. It’s hard to imagine a beer better done for the NE IPA style. Yes this has all the best of the typical NE IPAs: it looks like bright orange juice with great carbonation, it has fruity tropical aroma and flavor sweetest. And it has a creamy full mouthfeel. The difference with this one is it’s bigger in all those qualities versus the competition. Bigger aroma. Bigger ripe tropical fruit basket flavors. Bigger and better mouthfeel.. It is the King of the North (east).	4.99
228	King JJJuliusss	L - orange clolor, murky body, two fingers of white head. S - Melon, orange rind, dank hops. T- Melon bomb with orange sherbet, lime, and lemon. Earthy notes too..  303 characters	4.58
229	King JJJuliusss	Canned 06/12/19, 11:27:07, “YOU COME AT THE KING, YOU BEST NOT MISS”.. It’s the top-rated beer on Untappd, so it must be the best beer of all-time... right? Guess we’ll find out.. The pour on this is beautiful, a deep golden hue that’s completely opaque. The rising head froths up to about an inch, leaving a ton of uneven patterns of lace behind it as it settles into the beer in varying patches of foam..  2,016 characters	4.9
230	King JJJuliusss	"Had a cold 16 oz can of this and split it with my brothers for the 4th. First beer of the day as I wanted to have no palate fatigue etc. Pouring into an english pint glass.
Beer pours a hazy orange juice color with fluffy eggshell white head of 2cm foaming up on a gentle pour. The foam fades slowly leaving a sturdy edge layer throughout the sampling.
Big aroma of citrus right off the pour. Orange notes and some grapefruit rind with a bit of sweeter tropical mango mixed in. not really any malt note that I detect and the booze is hidden as well.
First sip reveals an amazingly creamy texture with soft gentle rolling carbonation. The physical traits on this brew make for easy drinking and are very enjoyable, maybe the best physical feel of a TH beer that I have had.
Flavor is what is expected with citrus and citrus. I get some sweet orange and mango with a bit of grapefruit pith bite on the finish that is muted by the sweet juicy notes. No hint of the ABV and this 8.4% brew could be dangerous, if anyone drank more than one in a sitting.
Glad I got to score this brew and even happier that I could share it with my brothers. Quite a nice NEIPA!"	4.55
231	King JJJuliusss	Presentation: 16 oz. can with the canning date printed on the bottom. Served in a Willi Becher glass.. Appearance: The foamy, two finger head stays around for a very long time and leaves behind a lot of lacing in rings and patches. It's a murky, opaque gold color.. Smell: It's a soft and pleasant fruity aroma of grapefruit and orange peels, fresh pineapple and a dank, pine earthiness..  913 characters	4.4
232	King JJJuliusss	Pours an opaque, turbid orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is tropical fruit, jelly, mango, tangerine, nectarine and lemon. Splendid tropical fruit display. Flavor profile is jelly, nectarine, grapefruit, papaya, tangerine, orange, mandarin and a little nettle and herbal hops when it's colder (~40F). Mouth feel is medium-thick with soft and pillowy texture. Overall, big tropical fruits with sublime smoothness.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 16oz can. Side-by-side with Narrow Gauge King OJ Run.	4.76
233	King JJJuliusss	It’s on another level. Mouth feel is big and fluffy, tropical fruit for days with no unwelcome bitterness or off flavors.. Drinking side by side with fresh, regular Julius and it’s not even close. Bigger, thicker, hoppier, with no downside. Wow	5
234	King JJJuliusss	Canned 6/12/19, a week and a half ago.. A: Pours an orangish pale, completely opaque, with two fingers of dense but fluffy white foam that slowly deflates. Great retention and intricate lacing.. S: Super pungent, dense tangerine and mango. An explosion of hop goodness. Light dried flowers, and a bit herbal/dank..  694 characters	4.75
235	King JJJuliusss	Honestly, and I'm not surprised, I still think I enjoy regular Julius the most out of this part of the family tree.. Opaque dark maize with a fluffy lumpy white head leaving some arms of lace on the glass.. This is more tropical than the other iterations of Julius. Pineapple, passion fruit, mango and rambutan populate the palate, but there's also a welcome hint of mild, soft biscuit. There's even a slight dankness I don't normally get out of TH beers, and a little booze on the exhale..  677 characters	4.15
236	King JJJuliusss	"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton. MA
06/12/19
Served in a teku. Cloudy, marigold yellow appearance. The nearly opaque body was topped by a frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that slowly receded. A wall of streaky, spotty lacing coated the glass and stuck around almost until the drink’s end.. The nose was amazingly hoppy and fruity. Huge tropical fruit presence. Guava and mango came through big time. Loads of honeydew melon too. There was an intense peachy quality as well, along with a touch of dankness. Appropriately sweet for the style. As the beer sat, citrus notes appeared, as did a subtle booziness..  1,409 characters"	4.72
237	King JJJuliusss	"Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name. Like the above lyrics, this is artistry on the highest level. This surpassed every expectation of NEIPA without revealing any limit to its talent or energy. I have no words for it other than F*CKKKKKKKK!!!"	5
238	King JJJuliusss	"Surpassed JM to be my favorite TH haze for me this lived up to the hype thank god.. Nose: Dank Tropical Fruit Basket, Mango, Peaches, OJ, a little pine
Taste: Candied Oranges, Sweet Peach Rings, Tropical Fruits, and a tiny bit of pine on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Creamy medium body with a juicy mouthfeel. Insane Drinkability."	4.94
239	King JJJuliusss	"Haven't reviewed in quite a while, figured I'd pick a mega whale to return from my hiatus.. Look:
Pours like mango juice with an impenetrably hazy, but non pulpy appearance.. Smell:
Huge aroma of tropical fruit, mango, orange, and papaya. Not much else, but what's there is plenty..  1,012 characters"	5
240	King JJJuliusss	"Kjjj
Look: 5 orange yellpw, big creamy head
Smell: 4.75 danky, peach and tropical fruit
Taste:4.75 tropical, very danky, peach, slight lemongrass
Feel:4.5 fully body, dry finish
Overall: 4.75"	4.74
241	King JJJuliusss	Once in a while, Treehouse let’s everyone know why they’re on top. How they jam so many hops into an 8.4% DIPA and make it drink like 4% is something only Nate can pull off. There’s not much here that could be better.	4.86
242	King JJJuliusss	This was the first big beer that Tree House released after I got into them. I opted not to go, thinking they would release it again soon. It has been a while...so was excited to see it again. Pours ultra-hazy, light orange-yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is orange, vanilla, peach, and nectarine. Light bodied, slightly bitter, with moderate carbonation. A juice bomb, but not one that overwhelms. The beauty of this beer is how subtle, smooth, and soft this huge beer is. Nothing bops you over the head with a dank hammer and that is ok. The body is amazing. A great ipa well worth the drive to get. I prefer this to Jjjuliusss by a lot.	5
243	King JJJuliusss	Absolutely, positively the King! Totally worth the 4 total hours of drive time and 1.5 hour wait in line. If pressed to choose between the best Treehouse has to offer, I think I'd give Juice Machine the nod, but both are off the charts to me.	5
244	King JJJuliusss	"“You come at the king, you best not miss”
Canned 06/12/19. Two damn days old!
Oh. My. Goodness. This is madness. I think we’ve reached peak NEIPA. So damn intense. So damn hoppy. Suuuper smooth, dangerously dank, and jarringly juicy. I’ve had Julius and it was great but not mind-blowing and yet I haven’t had King Julius. Maybe that’s the perfect Julius beer, falling in the middle. Because while this is a stellar beer, and it’s super rare, annnd I feel lucky to have stumbled upon it on a random visit as it’s been several years since they brewed it, it’s just too over the top. I had Doubleganger before this and that seemed much more balanced and drinkable."	4.66
245	King JJJuliusss	*Choo choo* time for Tree House to run another hype train on me.. Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.. Pours an opaque deep orange color with a finger of eggshell white head. The head has good retention, leaving a crown of lacing as it eventually settles into a halo..  1,012 characters	4.51
246	King JJJuliusss	Very cloudy deep rich darker stray appearance with a significant head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a nice prominent grapefruit and citrus. Taste is a little bitter less prominent grapefruit that is a little disappointing.	4.42
247	King JJJuliusss	Brewed for 4th anniversary, reviewed 7/4/16.. A: Haze for days. Slightly darker orange color with an off-white head filled with tiny packed bubbles.. S: Explosive nose. It's an insanely intense tropical fruit smoothie. Oranges, mangoes, peaches, pineapples. A bit of an herbaceous note behind that. This may be the best nose on a beer I've ever smelled..  896 characters	4.98
248	King JJJuliusss	This thing punches you in the mouth with an overload of hops. I thought it couldn't get any hoppier than regular King Julius. I was wrong. These will be the best burps you will ever taste. Just a clinic in how to load a beer up on hops properly. Thanks for the growler Elliott!	4.83
249	King JJJuliusss	This is an old rating from june, had an amazing mouthfeel with a juice explosion. Probably the best Dipa I've had from tree house, very green may be close	5
250	Fundamental Observation	Bottle at Annual RIS share. Dark black pour with small ring of head.Aroma is sweet, vanilla, brown sugar. Taste brings in coffee, roast malts, whiskey barrel. Strong sticky , sweet.	4.01
251	Fundamental Observation	500ml bottle poured into SP wine stem.. batch 5 (2019). Appearance: black bodied beer with thick cap of medium brown head..  1,253 characters	4.75
252	Fundamental Observation	"Drank from a 1 pint 0.9 fl. oz./500 ml bottle purchased at BevMo!, West Hollywood, CA
Release 2019
Served in a snifter. Review #1800. Uber thick, pitch black appearance. The viscous, oily looking body was topped by small, finely bubbled, mocha colored crown that quickly dropped to a thin collar. No lacing or head retention whatsoever..  1,595 characters"	4.51
253	Fundamental Observation	Pours black with a half pinky size dark brown head on draft. Aroma- very fishy tootsie roll,vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. The alcohol hits up front followed by the dessert vanilla and chocolate. Finished with strong bourbon too. Very well balanced. Pretty sweet. But not just vanilla sweetness. mouthfeel is thick and tingly and hot. Overall- fantastic. Very delicious beer. Could drink a lot of this. Well balanced while still being dessert.	4.77
254	Fundamental Observation	(2019) No. 5. 13.55% ABV. Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Portsmouth tulip.. Clear umber body with an ecru/camel/tan head. Lasting surface slick and popped collar; fine sandy lacing; good retention (given the ABV).. Pungent aromatics with rich bourbon notes, cocoa, tobacco, coffee, vanilla, and Belgian waffles in the nose..  1,051 characters	4.46
255	Fundamental Observation	Bottle Logic Fundamental Observation (2018). Look: This stout pours opaque and dark brown in color. A half finger, light brown head settles with a thick ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Swirls of foam sit on top of the liquid. Some legs after I swirl the beer, but no lacing. No visible carbonation. After sipping for a while all foam subsided but for a thin ring around the edge.. Smell: The aroma entices. Stout, bourbon, barrel, vanilla all present nicely. This bourbon barrel aged stout is spirit and barrel forward. The vanilla also pops in a natural and creamy way that reminds me of icing. The stout offer notes of chocolate, some dark dried fruit and a hint of nutty coffee..  1,921 characters	4.45
256	Fundamental Observation	Sweet, vanilla, slightly boozy aromatics on this one! Taste follows with vanilla prominent and dominant! Choco vibes on the finish, but vanilla is the main character here...felt great on palate!	4.31
257	Fundamental Observation	2019 No. 5. Appearance: Very dark brown with a medium sized dark beige head which quickly faded. Nice looking Imperial Stout.. Smell: Prominent vanilla and Bourbon, brown sugar, and modest coffee/roasted malt notes. The beer has a nice nose..  995 characters	4.6
258	Fundamental Observation	Pouring from a 16.9 oz bottle into a PAA Dino glass, this beer pours out like a blanket of night sky that coats the glass with a blackness. Almost two fingers of light caramel/peanut colored crown rest on top. Crown sticks around for a few minutes before receding and settling into a ring attached to the glass. 4.75. The nose is melted, sticky marshmallows. Almost like the marshmallow creme. Fudgey chocolate, brownie batter, cocoa mix. 4.75. The taste brings in marshmallow creme as well, along with vanilla and chocolate cake batter, cocoa mix, very slight touch of dark fruit and leather. Faint booziness and dry oak. 4.5.  914 characters	4.63
259	Fundamental Observation	Tried a 2018 bottle in a teku glass in Sept 2019.. L: A wonderful midnight brew, but unlike a lot of top tasting stouts, this one manages a half finger tan head with good retention and lacing.. S: Divine. Wonderful quality of bourbon melds effortlessly with vanilla, powerful raisins, oak, and hot cocoa..  830 characters	4.93
260	Fundamental Observation	Tasted 2018 and 2018 bottles H2H, our first experience with FO. It's a bit too sweet for me, and a bit thin. Definitely enjoyed it, but it doesn't 'trip my trigger'.	4.39
261	Fundamental Observation	Black with ruby edges; dark tan mousse-like head; good cap retention; medium heavy lace; solid ring; medium heavy legs. 4.75. Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla; bourbon on exhale; smells like a bourbon soaked tootsie roll. 4.75. Chocolate, fudge brownies, oak, vanilla and bourbon; dark fruit- raisins and prune sweetness middle; chocolate finish. 5.0.  622 characters	4.83
262	Fundamental Observation	Review #700. Man oh man this was an incredible beer. Totally lives up to its hype. I'm always wary of these highly-lauded beers as they can sometimes fall disappointingly short of their hype, and I try not to overload myself by reading other people's reviews or ratings as I don't want to unduly influence my own experience of the beer. Having said that, this was an incredible imperial stout - a 2018 vintage that I had been saving for a while now and was waiting until a memorable time (review #700). Pours a deep, dark, rich opaque black color with some great-looking dark tan head - initially foamy and fluffy, later settling to a nice cap. The lacing was more spotty than I would have liked, but it still lingering for a long time and if it had been more sheet-like I would have given an even higher rating for this beer's look. Smells absolutely incredible - tough to imagine another imperial stout with better aromas than this one. Dark, rich chocolate fudge, dark roast coffee, an incredible vanilla aroma, caramel, malt, brown sugar and a touch of roasted nuttiness. Good hit of oak and bourbon at the beginning and end. Taste follows the nose almost perfectly - no reduction in the complexity, depth or balance of the flavor notes. The vanilla was better than any vanilla aromas or notes I'd ever previously experienced in an imperial stout. Crisp, bright and fragrant, I could drink stouts infused with that vanilla any day of the week. Smooth, rich, slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel and the perfect amount of carbonation. Decent amount of warming alcohol even when the beer was cold. Definitely a sipper. Pairs well with savory food - doesn't have to go with sweeter dessert like some other imperial stouts. Truly an incredible beer and I'm so glad I got my hands on a bottle. I'm definitely looking for more.	4.55
263	Fundamental Observation	"Big thanks to CanConPhilly for this
500 ml bottle, 2018, poured into a teku. A- Black with a two finger mocha head.. S- Tons of vanilla and bourbon, oak, chocolate, hints of roasted malts..  387 characters"	4.81
264	Fundamental Observation	L - 1-finger moderate-density hazelnut head atop a pitch black body.. S - you can smell the bourbon from a mile away. Vanilla, oak, booze, milk chocolate.. T - bourbon-soaked vanilla beans. Not as boozy as the smell would predict. Milk chocolate, roast. Moderate-low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate booziness..  396 characters	4.45
265	Fundamental Observation	Look: nice head, pours dark but somewhat thin. Smell: not much going on here, somewhat sweet. Taste: again, very very sweet with some vanilla on the finish, barrel on the finish.  276 characters	3.65
266	Fundamental Observation	This beer is really good but a bit overrated. Joining a trading forum is a task. Not worth the price to acquire outside of Cali. 2018 Bourbon County Vanilla was better. I still have 1 bottle of 2018 FO. I will sit on it. Planning a blind BBA Vanilla tasting with Handjee, FO, Bourbon County Vanilla, Vlad Vanilla and others. Let's see whar the blind tasing reveals.	4.66
267	Fundamental Observation	Split an FO batch 4 bottle with my cousin. WOW!!!!! This is what a vanilla stout should taste like!! Perfect balance, rich vanilla taste with absolutely no hint of any extract-like qualities. Blows Marshmallow Handjee out of the water, and takes a monster deuce all over BCBVS.	4.93
268	Fundamental Observation	FOB3 2017, drank May 1, 2019 in a nice curvy stemmed tulip.. Poured jet black with very little head, emitted a small amount of tannish edge head throughout the drink, and also a nice little inch wide island of head in the center.. Smell was fresh stout and vanilla cake, and Bourbon, which I got at every sip..  880 characters	4.39
269	Fundamental Observation	Pours a thick, oily black with no head. Smell is vanilla, a little oak, some toffee. Taste is very vanilla forward. Vanilla and bourbon. I get a little oak again...but this time there is a hint of fruit but not much..  440 characters	4.19
270	Fundamental Observation	poured into a taster glass via draft at Other Half's Pastry Town (3/16/2019). Color is midnight, dark and dense. Smell is vanilla extract and bourbon.  539 characters	4.03
271	Fundamental Observation	Bottled summer 2016; drank 8/13/16 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Black/brown appearance.. Almost no tan head; almost no lace..  469 characters	4.67
272	Fundamental Observation	I love beer, in all its varieties, shapes, colors, and aromas, but there are a few beers that the anticipation of trying them is nearly as intoxicating (pun intended) as actually trying them.. If you’re a Midwesterner, I’m talking Zombie Dust, circa 2013. Or King Sue, circa 2016. If you’re from the magnificent East Coast, Heady. Or Tree House stuff. You know these beers.. The whales..  1,133 characters	4.75
273	Fundamental Observation	"2018 Bomber
Bourbon and vanilla aromas burst from the bottle after removing the cap.
Pours black with 1 finger mocha head that quickly dissipates.
Sudsy lacing on tulip glass.
Strong aroma of bourbon and wood. Sweet vanilla too.
Vanilla hits me first on taking a drink. It dominates. There is bourbon in the aftertaste. The stout has a nice charred roast base. The bourbon is coming on strong, but does not burn. The mouthfeel is solid and not cloying.
Overall, this is a top notch barrel aged stout. It is not dry and woody like one might expect."	4.77
274	Fundamental Observation	"A - Dark midnight brown. Not much head or lacing to speak of, but i did pour it rather gently.
S - Sweet, sweet vanilla bourbon cream. Rich chocolatey roasted malt and I can't wait to take a sip. Smells like the best kind of rich dessert - one with booze in it.
T - Huge vanilla. It's so rich and decadent but not at all sweet. Literally the perfect amount of bourbon flavor for me. Oak, light coconut, and nutty malt flavors in the background. Vanilla cream pie drizzled with a chocolate bourbon sauce. Amazing, and living up to the hype at least for me. This is my 4th Bottle Logic BA beer and I just love their malt base each time.
M - Surprisingly a little thinner than I anticipated and it works great. Raises the drinkability factor. Its gonna suck when this glass is empty. Nitpicking I might want a hair more carbonation.
O - Damn near perfect for me. Havent done an official review yet, but I imagine it'll be a top 5 in my ratings on here. Can only imagine what the first couple batches were like."	4.71
275	SR-71	Wow! Got a bottle of the 2014 a while back and have been sitting on it for awhile. The whisky is there but well hidden. Very sweet. Velvety thick mouthfeel. Nearly perfect!	4.84
276	SR-71	"Had this when on tap at TG brewery in summer of 2018.
Small pour in a small glass.
Dark as can be.
Thick, it was making big legs in the glass.
Smell was BAM!! Deep chocolate and coffee!
The taste...oh my gosh, it was so strong I had to share it with my family it was amazing!!! A 5 oz pour was $18!! But so worth it! Epic good! Not sweet like Mornin Delight but still that powerful stout flavor, wow! This is top notch!!!"	4.78
277	SR-71	"Enjoyed at GAB bottle share
Pours a darker thick but small head, decent retention, long legs, pitch black thick soupy stains the glass. Nose big roasted dark cocoa coffee, heavy syrupy malt, little dried fruit, vanilla, tons of coffee, rich cocoa. Taste boozy fruity like brandy raisin thing, molasses syrup, roasted malt and coffee, little cocoa fudge, a bit of bourbon and brandy, slight acrid.  492 characters"	4.33
278	SR-71	Incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Amazing barrel characteristics. Great body. Over all one of the best Barrel Aged Stouts I've had. I must say that I feel like Barrel Aged Dark Lord is just as good or better at a quarter of the price though...	4.77
279	SR-71	I don't know what was up with this, but I didn't find this beer very good at all. It was slightly tart on the finish, which made me think it was going bad in some form. I didn't get much barrel character, thinner mouthfeel and compared to all the other stouts we were enjoying, probably the worst of the night which is crazy. Likely just a bad bottle, but didn't know those existed with this beer. Unfortunate, but rating is as accurate as I can be with it.	2.61
280	SR-71	What an amazing nose that lingers well after I've stopped smelling; supremely luscious body, with the flavors lingering for a while too; the finish is boozy yet controlled, balanced, and well executed.	4.74
281	SR-71	"Gold Wax bottle poured into a snifter.. L: Jet black, no light escaping through.
S: Whisky and chocolate.
T: Heavy whisky and barrel presence, light chocolate and vanilla flavors.
F: Thick as they come. Perfect mouthfeel.
O: This beer didn't come close to the hype it receives. It's excellent but drinking next to a 2010 BCS Rare makes you wonder why this beer is valued so much higher."	4.54
282	SR-71	"This beer takes everything that is lovely about purple wax Assassin and amplifies it into a sludgy, brownie-batter-dipped-in-whiskey beer. Overall, the flavor profile is akin to Assassin, with bursts of fudge and dark chocolate on the palate, followed by waves of raisiny, dark fruit flavor. The barrel presence is more pronounced, with a woodier, more bourbon-forward profile, but it never delves into the trenches of the dreaded cicerone descriptor of, ""too hot."" The mouthfeel on this beer is virtually unrivaled by any other in the game.. SR-71 is a special beer. It is not worth 2.5x Assassin 2016, though. This is one of those beers you reach for when you want that elite craft beer experience to celebrate precious moments in time."	4.88
283	SR-71	Pours thick and black, with a thin dark brown head that fades to a dark brown ring around the glass. The aroma is chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is chocolate, marshmallow, vanilla, lots of barrel, but not boozy. There also seems to be some smokiness on the finish. It's a little on the sweet side, but not overly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick. Overall, this beer is a work of art. Like KBBS, I was worried that it was over-hyped, but, also like KBBS, that is not the case. This beer is as close to perfect as a barrel-aged stout can be.	4.9
284	SR-71	"Format: 4 oz pour from Toppling Goliath taproom.
L: Dark black, thick motor oil. Very little to no head.
S: Boozy bourbon, oak barrel and molasses.
T: Cold - Very bourbon forward. Could not taste much else.
Warmed up - Flavors really start to open up. Bourbon, molasses, oak, chocolate syrup.
F: Thick and syrupy.
O: Excellent barrel aged imperial stout. Well worth the price I paid for the 4 oz pour, and I am thankful I had the opportunity to try it."	4.81
285	SR-71	B2 from the bottle, at about 65 degrees.. L: Jet black. Dark, mocha head. Pours from bottle like motor oil. The beer leaves a dark brown tint and alcohol legs on parts of the glass it touches.. S: As it pours, smells of marshmallow, chocolate complimented with a little barrel smell. Nothing overpowering. Incredible..  571 characters	5
286	SR-71	What is funny about my SR-71 experience is - while I missed the release of 2018, I was able to enjoy the OG bottle the very same day.. While cool/cold, SR-71 is tasting a bit oxidized. The barrels and quite a bit of chocolate are still present, but the beer tastes a bit dull and stale. As the beer warms, the chocolate turns to fudge, and that oxidization fades quickly. SR-71 is extremely barrel forward, yet still exhibits loads of chocolate and fudge in the nose and taste. It's a delicious beer, and I rate it highly - I think my one experience with it will have to suffice. Given secondary values, I'm fairly sure that I'll never see it again - and that's okay. This one experience has been quite memorable enough.	5
287	SR-71	Drank on 6/11/2018. 11oz pour. Silver wax bottle. This was set out for 25 minutes before drinking while the pour took roughly an hour to consume.. Look-motor oil thick just like the other TGs. Tons of lacing, especially as more gets drank. Remains continue to coat the sides of the glass. Tiny mocha colored head. Smell-exactly as expected, dark chocolate, boozy bourbon barrel, hint of vanilla, some oak, a little molasses and caramel.  1,020 characters	4.89
288	SR-71	2015: 4.9 Best stout I've ever had. Luscious, thick, crazy nose. Like smelling flavors of a good whisky....some heat, then fudge, then caramel, then vanilla. Amazing beer. Aftertaste is of honey and coats your tongue. Certainly sweet but great flavors where the barrel cuts the sweetness of the base stouts. Had side by side with Assassin 14 one time; Killed it. and way better then 2018 SR. I think this beer was a happy accident that they will never recreate.. 2018: 4.14 Different beer. Still thick, still fuggy, weird metallic after taste. Doesn't have the same nose, more of a thick super sweet stout. The fudginess and mouthfeel are the redeeming qualities, but a different beer than 2015. Good stout, but not worth the price and wouldn't even compare to Batch 1.	4.97
289	SR-71	Had this almost a year ago. Was delicious. Great thickness, great mouth feel. Not hot. Great barrel taste. Smell was very nice, bourbon came through great. Great thick body	5
290	SR-71	At the Toppling Goliath new brewery opening. Got a pretty large pour. Dark chocolate, fudge, and bourbon. Overall an amazing beer that I was very fortunate to be able to have.	5
291	SR-71	"Prior to tasting, I wanted to hate it. I wanted to love it.
It looks perfects, smells nice, nice mouthfeel, and tastes delicious. It may be the bar for a barrel-aged stout. Perfection. Its hard to describe. I'm not wowed, but at the same time its subtle, rounded, and wonderful. I'm going to side by side w 2016 BCBS in a minute.
...back. My hunch was BCBS was a similar beer from memory. Its not. SR-71 crushes it."	4.73
292	SR-71	Side by side at a killer whalez share, this was incredible.... can't rank anything equal to Bake Kujira but this is definitely in the top beers I've ever had. Huuuuuuuge body - thicker than any body with no adjuncts that I've ever come across, barrel so well integrated into the chocolate-forward base. It's the best non-adjunct stout you will ever come across and was a completely different monster from that of a fresh 2016 Assassin, we had right before this one.	5
293	SR-71	"Had this at the Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds, at Moeder Lambic cellar, side by side with KBBS '14, MD #2 and yellow wax Assassin
A: Looks exactly like Assassin, pitch black, very thick and sticky, with a decent retention.
S: Smell is very similar to Assassin, focused on vanilla and chocolate, with notes of marzipan and dried fruits. At the beginning, I had a hard time differenciating both beers, but as it warmed, it became a little bit boozier, the barrel ageing emphasizing the alcohol content.
T: Taste is also very similar, on vanilla, marzipan, chocolate and fudge, but a little less mellowed and with more alcohol and more bitterness on the finish. Also very sweet.
M: Thick, almost syrupy. A little bit smoother on the palate than Assassin, but the alcohol kick makes it a little bit less enjoyable than Assassin.
O: Very similar to Assassin but a little bit less well integrated which prevents this to being great. Probably my least favorite of the TG stouts, still a very good brew."	4.49
294	SR-71	Very similar to Assassin but somehow better. So does this make this beer a 5+? Might need to adjust your rating scale BA to make Ron for a beer this good. Best nonmaple BA bet I have ever had.	5
295	SR-71	Brownie, vanilla, marshmallow, roast, and barrel treatment in perfect balance. Viscous but not mucous. This has to be the perfect iteration of this style.	5
296	SR-71	This hits all the right notes. Super thick stout. Sweet, but not crazy sweet. Toppling Goliath has done it again. This is nearly perfect in all aspects. I wish this was widely available.	4.63
297	SR-71	I normally don't rate anything all 5s, but this is hands down the best BA Imperial Stout that I've ever had, adjuncts or no, and side by side with KBBS it blew it out of the water. This beer is phenomenal.	5
298	SR-71	"I gave it a 5, a 5, a F'n 5.. But my friend rated it: ""4.8, and I still got wood."". So we settled in the middle and gave it a 4.9. I just hope you don't spend all night with this beer only to ruin Coach Kilmer's perfect season the next day. SR-71 may have been the back up plan to Assassin, but it doesn't want your life."	4.99
299	SR-71	This beer is so thick, leaving layers of oily like substances on the glass. Great smell of bourbon and wood, tastes like vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, syrup, very smooth and very balanced. Great beer, happy to have tasted this.	4.76
300	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	The beer was purchased in a four pack of 12 oz bottles. Dark brown body had ruby highlights when held up against light. The head was brown, and one finger thick. The beer was lightly carbonated, and the head disappeared shortly after pouring. The aroma was rich, with coffee beans, toffee, and chocolate being the predominant smells. The taste had an incredible depth to it, as the flavors of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, and caramel were in perfect harmony. The alcohol content was generously war,m. This was definitely a slow sipper, as the sweet aftertaste lingered on and on after swallowing. The body was thick, rich, and coated every corner of the mouth. So glad to have finally found it on the shelves locally. The cost is pretty high at around $24 a four pack, but when you want the best, you have to pay.	4.63
301	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Black with tan lacing.. Baker's chocolate, hints of alcohol, roasted malt. Definitely a pronounced smell.. Maple's there and opens up after a few sips. It's a sweetness that's not lactose but a tinge metallic. Can't pick out the bourbon which seems odd. Coffee's in the background and not harsh -- that's what keeps this from competing with TH's Good Morning. Intense but I'm not even considering not finishing, maybe because it's finally in a 12oz. I hope they keep doing this..  552 characters	4.73
302	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Tasting a 12 oz. bottle on 11/8/2019 which is dated 10/3/2019.. Pour: Dark molasses with a dark, creamy tan head that dissipates with little to no lacing.. Nose: Surprising subtle for a beer of this ABV and complexity. Mild maple and coffee on the nose. Just a whiff of chocolate. A hint of things to come?.  980 characters	4.81
303	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	From a 12oz bottle dated 9/25/19 into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with about a finger of brown head. Smell is mainly a sweet boozy chocolaty coffee mix. Taste follows, maple and chocolate up front, slight coffee in the background. Alcohol taste recedes as warming occurs. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth, surprisingly smooth for the abv-very enjoyable. Overall, this deserves the high ratings. An excellent brew that lives up to the hype IMHO.	4.61
304	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	"Nov 2019 2019 Vintage
12oz bottle (!) poured into a CBS chalice. Served at 50 degrees.. Pour: deep brown with 1-2 finger tan head. Lots of lacing, bubbles and clouds throughout.. Nose: maple, coffee, dark chocolate..  2,580 characters"	4.42
305	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	"LOOK: Inky black with delicate lacing
SMELL: roast coffees a hint of cinnamon
TASTE: semi sweet chocolate with a dark toast slightly bitter finish
FEEL: Rich and thick
OVERALL: Sublime"	5
306	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	2019 vintage. Bottled on 9/16/19. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours black with a fluffy dark khaki head that falls leaving nice bubbly retention and nice lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Some cocoa and chocolate. Some caramel. Subtle bourbon notes. The flavors are bolder than the nose. The maple syrup shines without dominating. Lots of milk chocolate along with some dark chocolate. More caramel along with some hints of vanilla. The coffee is subtle and balanced, but comes through. The bourbon blends well and accentuates everything that's going on. Moderate to low bitterness. There's a nice sweetness to this one, but it's not cloying or over the top. Nice malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is ultimately well hidden. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, smooth and dangerously drinkable.. This is a really nice barrel-aged brew. Balance is the key with this one. The maple syrup, bourbon, chocolate and coffee all blend well together. This is my first time having CBS, so I can't compare it to previous vintages. It's definitely not my new personal favorite barrel-aged stout that I've had, but it's still great stuff. No complaints here.	4.13
307	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	"Sampled this amazing 2019 version of the beer at Stoddard's Boston. This is reportedly the last year that Founders will make CBS.
Appearance: opaque mahogany appropriate for the style.
Aroma: bourbon and brown sugar. Molasses, spice, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Dried figs/raisins/prunes.
Taste: sweet and sweet, with bourbony alcohol bite at the finish. Lots more dried fruit, coffee, chocolate.
Mouthfeel: full bodied bite of awesome.
Overall: do yourself a favor and let this one warm up a little. At first taste, this was just sweet and had little character, but as it warmed it blossomed into the amazing beer it is supposed to be. Get it while you can, because this is your last chance!"	4.73
308	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Been a big fan of Founders since discovering their Centennial Ale IPA. I'm mostly a hop head by trade but I also love good beers from almost any genre. This is as good a stout as any good stout will ever be, but in its own unique category of course. How many Breweries age an imperial stout in used maple syrup barrels? It's not to say there is that much detectable maple flavor but it still has something to do with the finished product. This special brew is extremely balanced with all it's ingredients and processing. It's hard to hold this treat back once you've had one, and it even inspires one to share the joy of this beer. A beer worth bragging about if you are serving it to family and friends. Cheers	4.87
309	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	2019 edition. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Nearly black pour with a good finger+ of tannish head. Great lacing.. S: Sweets, roast, and booze..  602 characters	4.5
310	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Well. Very good beer, usual look, amazing aroma maple, chocolate noted. Taste follows, too sweet, maple, barrel. chocolate, no coffee. perfect mouthfeel, very easy to drink 2. Honestly, I preferred the draft from 2017 was it? that was very coffee forward if I remember correctly. Bottom line, $25 for 4 is not that bad, but if you compare this to $22 for KBS, or, better yet, the best beer of all time, $25 for 4 2012 regular Bourbon County, it doesn't compare. Look, I know where craft has been, and I see where it's going ... i am looking forward to this years Willettized. Last year's bombers were amazing.	4.37
311	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Founders CBS has a medium, beige-to-tan head, a very dark brown (nearly black) appearance, and some glass lacing. The aroma is of rich chocolate, coffee, malt, and sugar. The flavor is similar, with fairly low bitterness. I did not pick up specific maple nor bourbon. Mouthfeel is heavy, and Founders CBS 2019 finishes sweet.. RJT	5
312	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Happy to proclaim Founders CBS as my 5,000th different beer. Subliminal coffee, nice deep long-lasting chocolate flavor. This beer was aged over two years and so was extremely smooth.	4.63
313	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Wow, just wow! I searched for CBS for a long time before randomly coming across a whole case at a random party store outside of my city (Madison Heights, MI). I can’t tell you this, the hype is real. I like KBS by founders but man this is next level. It’s very similar to KBS but just taste better, it must be the Maple Barrels. It’s very smooth, not much alcohol taste, just a little bite at the finish but not much at all. If you can go this this beer, I’ve bought 5 more bottles just to age myself and enjoy when I’m not in Michigan!	5
314	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	355 mL bottle purchased at the LCBO earlier this year; listed at 11.6%, best before Sept 24 2019 and served barely chilled. Oh shoot, looks like I missed the BB date... by an hour. I think I'll risk it.. Pours an opaque brownish-black hue, giving rise to nearly one finger of foamy, bubbly, tan-coloured head that erodes in less than two minutes' time. A thin collar of froth lives on, with a modest amount of lace scattered about in the process; looks typical for the style. Coffee grounds, cacao and molasses on the nose, accompanied by minor notes of burnt wood, licorice, maple syrup, vanilla and alcohol. Very nice, and it does open up as it warms.. Positively delicious and complex, with layers upon layers of flavours for my taste buds to sift through. Molasses, baker's chocolate and coffee come through at the forefront, with hints of bourbon, date square, vanilla and maple sugar gaining momentum thereafter. Coffee grounds, wood and bourbon combine at the climax, with more maple sugar sweetness, vanilla and a touch of alcohol carrying on through into a persistent aftertaste. Full-bodied, with low carbonation levels that limply nudge against the tongue; exceedingly silky-smooth and soft texture, which is just what I want from an imperial BBA maple syrup stout. This'll keep ya warm and toasty inside your igloo on even the coldest Canadian winter's night..  2,010 characters	4.57
315	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Hoo boy. Finally found a bottle of this stuff. Couldn't wait to try it. Lets get to it.. Pours out dark brown, nearly black. It seemed thinner than I anticipated during the pour. Only a tiny quarter finger of head formed during an extremely aggressive pour into a friends glass. Into my glass there was no such luck. But it didn't stick around for long anyhow. A little bit of lacing.. Nose was coffee, coffee, coffee. Right out of the gate. But it's a Breakfast Stout variant, so as expected. Then chocolate and wood. Not necessarily maple popping out but there in the form of mild sweetness..  1,748 characters	4.59
316	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	This beer was $29 at Monterey Deli! The cashier gasped when they saw the price. I told them I'd tell them if it was worth it. Was it? I mean... it's a smooth drinking malty sweet coffee stout bomb... it's boozy and delicious... but probably not worth the price. But I did enjoy it	4.53
317	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	L. I poured this from the bottle into a pint glass in Brisbane, Australia and it was a touch lifeless. Not sure why. Great black/dark brown colour with khaki/tan head but the head was half centimetre at most and dissipated quickly. S. Nothing wrong here, although never strong for me. Sweet, a hint of coffee and chocolate. T. I agree with some that sweeter than KBS, which isn't a criticism. Rich, chocolate, coffee and sweetness. F. Syrupy, smooth mouth feel. O. Very good, although a touch sweet for a drinking beer. Might reserve for a dessert beer in the future and would be exceptional with macadamia caramel pie or similar.	4.46
318	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Poured from a 2018 bottle into a snifter.. Look: absolutely pitch black when held up to the light.. Smell: When I first opened the bottle I was immediately hit with huge notes a bourbon and chocolate..  739 characters	4.66
319	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	"LOOK: Super dark, black with no light at all coming through. Very Opaque. With a energetic pour, I ended up with a 1 finger head that was reduced to a foam ring in a minute or two. Some lacing continues on and it doesn't seem to ever go flat - totally. Foam was a nice dark khaki color. Expected as it is a barrel aged beer and a pretty high ABV.. SMELL: RICH chocolate and coffee and some booze wafts up as well. Hints of vanilla and charred wood. Smells very sweet and dessert-like.. TASTE: HUGE blast of bitter hops and/or super dark roasted grains. Huge blast of alcohol comes in as well. It is quickly taken over by sweet chocolate and maple syrup with a tiny hint of coffee. This beer is very complex and has a lot going on. There are so many flavors from the beer itself that make an appearance - but then there are also many flavors coming in from the barrel. There is vanilla, charred oak, and bourbon. It dries out only slightly and stays desserty. After the initial flavors fade away, you are left with some chocolate and caramel, dark roasted grains, charred ""campfire"" wood, and some dark brown sugar. Very flavorful!!!!!!!!!Q.  1,760 characters"	4.77
320	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Pours completely black, big beige head slowly dissipates leaving sticky lace. Small bubbles.. Sweet aromas of mainly maple syrup and vanilla, sweet chocolate and coffee a step behind. Some flowery note too. Barrel/wood presence almost absent.. Tastes very sweet, maple and vanilla. Not that much chocolate nor coffee nor wood..  458 characters	4.39
321	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Look: No head at all, but big big bubbles sticking to the sides. Black upon black. Seriously, I tried to shine a light through this and got absolutely nothing.. Smell: Leather, slight hint of maple, pine, cigar smoke. Oak. NB: whenever I lift this to my nose to take a whiff, I find myself involuntarily also taking a sip. Well done CBS, you sly dog. Smells even better than any of their other BBA stouts/browns.. Taste: The maple syrup you might be expecting is there, but it is eeeeeever so slight. Which is good. It's not overwhelming. It's present, but it barely feels like a flavored stout. Baker's chocolate. Chocolate flakes. Wood/oak, leather follow from the nose..  1,162 characters	4.41
322	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	A dense, sparkiling, three-inch, copper-to-dark-walnut thumb lingers five to ten minutes. As the head settles, it forms a ring and a veil over the black beer. A coating of lace is washed away by long, slow legs on a Swiftwater Anniversary tulip glass.. The aroma is deeply roasted, with strong, yet balanced, bourbon and maple sugar. That is followed by molasses, Baker's chocolate, coconut, and sweet cappuccino.. The flavor is quite sweet with a bitter bite. Charred malt is strong, followed by bourbon and maple syrup. I also noticed rich fudge and molasses before a long, modest finish. This beer warms exceptionally well and improves with an intensifying progression, rather than development, towards vanilla and coffee..  953 characters	4.61
323	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	Source is those mini-bottles (350mL?) of CBS from Founders. First off, insanely well priced for how great these monsters are. Absolutely the best looking stout I've ever poured, and it stays around forever. Intense maple and pleasant charred barrel on the nose, with an excellent roasted coffee/light bourbon backbone doing the heavy lifting. Punches you right away with this super unique charr/sweet bourbon mix that just works brilliantly, it's so punchy. There's quite a bit of bitterness that fades after a dozen seconds or so which mellows to a soft roasted coffee. The finish is very long but it's awfully subtle and very welcome.. Oh also, this is stupidly drinkable, the mouthfeel on this thing is near-perfect so be careful. Buy a case...or twelve.	4.68
324	CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)	"750ml bottle. 2017 vintage (Mountie is in the saddle).
Black colored body, with a glint of garnet when back lit. Three fingers of tan head upon initial pour; this settles back to a bubbly cap and ring. Leaves lots of lacing patterns on the glass.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, with chocolate and a little coffee. Bourbon barrel is certainly present and there is a whiff of maple syrup.
Taste expresses the coffee and chocolate, along with the maple syrup bourbon. Bourbon chocolate tails off in the aftertaste. The maple syrup lingers between sips.
Thicker mouth feel, with some mouth coating texture. Good carbonation.
Slightly sweet but that is to be expected from the maple syrup influence. Any bitterness is very low and can be attributed to the coffee. The best tasting part of the beer is in the aftertaste when the maple bourbon coats all with barrel sweetness. Higher ABV% is well hidden (no alcohol burn)."	4.43
325	Juice Machine	poured into a pint glass via can. color is tang orange. smell is dense citrus and sweet mango, papaya and banana?.  339 characters	4.69
326	Juice Machine	Wow. Waited 2 hours for this and worth every minute. My wife was my mule, and also waited to allow me to get 2 additional cans. I was thinking of leaving her, but I’ve decided the marriage is strong again. As everyone says, a mash of 2 great beers and this does not disappoint - the best of their DIPAs, which is all I need to say.	4.78
327	Juice Machine	L: Orange and hazy with a very generous head.. S: Limes, passion fruit, lemon peel, oranges.. T: Orange juice, strawberry cream, lemon drops, pineapple juice..  245 characters	4.29
328	Juice Machine	"A: Murky gold/orange with rich white foamy head and awesome lacing.
N: Massive tropical notes with some citrus mixed in.
T: Wow, loads of pineapple, mango, peaches, grapefruit, and lemons.
M: Creamy and smooth with zero ABV bite and a light bitterness on the finish.
O: One of the best beers I have had, this is really good and is a benchmark for others to aim for."	4.98
329	Juice Machine	One of the most complex beers I've ever had. This is a hard review because each batch of juice machine I've had is vastly different. The batch from (I believe) May of 2019 was tasted superior to the July or April batches. Judging by JM at its best, it rivals KJJJ and VGGG. At its worst, it's about as good as doppelganger to me (still an amazing beer). The juicy papaya and tropical grapefruit always shine, making it an interesting brew at the very least.	4.78
330	Juice Machine	Gentle pour into a pint glass. This beer is darker than quite few of the other beers in this style, similar in color to the meat of a slightly overripe peach. I get about 3/4 inch of eggshell colored head of foam. I'm expecting this beer to be thick and dank based upon appearance.. Straight out of the fridge the nose is a little subdued but hits all the standard Tree House fruity notes. Citrus is predominant. No surprises.. This is not bitter at all but it's not a pure juice bomb. Taste always follows the nose so of course it's citrus fruit, developing into a bit of peach or apricot on the back palate. As I said it's not aggressively bitter but it's not free of bitterness, which if not striking an ideal balance is sort of a unique and pleasant one..  1,319 characters	4.43
331	Juice Machine	As a tree house regular I expected major things from this highly regarded rare brew. Unfortunately the aroma and fruity hop flavor notes were notably muted when compared to other Treehouse superstars. This beer did induce a starburst-like juiciness upon drinking, however I must admit I was disappointed and would strongly recommend other TH brews (my all time favorite is Doubleganger) over this one.	3.96
332	Juice Machine	I live within striking distance of Treehouse so I have pretty good luck in trying the best of the best from them. Usually with Juice Machine there's a limit of 2 cans per day per customer for good reason.. I think this is my favorite Treehouse beer. King Julius would be a close 2nd. This beer is so easy to drink, it's almost like drinking Sunny Delight as a beer. Out of the can and into a British pint glass, it looks like a light orange juice with almost no head at all.. You get all kinds of sweet citrus juice flavors ... tangerine, mayer lemon, pineapple and almost no bitterness at all. It's refreshing and sweet and ... juicy. It has that great 'grape bubble gum' hop smell that blasts you when you visit the actual Treehouse Brewery..  1,814 characters	4.86
333	Juice Machine	The best of Treehouse IMHO. Tastes like combination of King Julius and Very Green. Complex flavor with Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy hops. Flavors of mango, orange, papaya, and passion fruit with soft mouthfeel and very limited bitterness.	4.75
334	Juice Machine	Pours an opaque orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, tangerine, mango, orange and mandarin orange in a splendid blend of tropical fruits. Very light yeast soothes and swells in the back to help taper off the tropical fruits. Flavor profile is nectarine, tangerine, mango, orange and mandarin orange in a swirly, tropical fruit smoothie. Malts and yeast are absent from the forefront, with only soft strands of bready yeast adding a little smoothness at the backend. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft and plush texture. Overall, big tropical fruit notes in this smoothie of a beer.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 16oz can.	4.66
335	Juice Machine	"16 oz can fresh
Pours golden orange dark
Thin fizzy white head
Smells of lots of different types of fruit and dank
Taste follows smell.
Awesome.
Sweet and bitter and dank and smooth too. Very rich."	4.61
336	Juice Machine	TREE HOUSE JUICE MACHINE IPA 7/3/19. Acquired at the brewery yesterday 7/2 after standing in line for an hour and a half with my youngest daughter.. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip..  657 characters	4.59
337	Juice Machine	Poured into a Teku glass. A hazy golden-yellow color with a medium white head. I could smell the aroma 3 feet from the beer when poured. Massive tropical aroma along with tangerine, pine resin, and white bread. The taste lived up to the hype. Tropical with complexity and a nice dank undercurrent. Silky with a pillowy feel on the palate. Exceptional.. Thanks zekeman17!	4.63
338	Juice Machine	Looks like a papaya milkshake, underneath a silky off white head, with citrus fruit aromas bursting from the can - the aforementioned papaya, tangerine, grapefruit, mango, some herbal notes. Wow.. The citrus flavors dominate, but what I most appreciate on the taste is the subtle toffee flavor. That is something I’ve not seen before in the NE-style, and it is incredible in this beer.. The mouthfeel is substantial, if just the slightest bit watery. All in all, a world class beer. This is worthy of the hype, IMHO.	4.56
339	Juice Machine	Insanely good. Nice deep golden orange, nice head. Smells nice, minty, mango, citrus, orange, hard candy. Taste explosion, amazing sensation, mango, creamy mint, papaya, orange citrus, white grape, pear, incredibly smooth feel, no hint of the alcohol, wish they made enough of this to crush them endlessly. One of the best.	4.79
340	Juice Machine	Pours a golden, ripe orange haze, with a nice, frothy head. Smells distinctly Treehouse, with notes of sweet citrus, mango, and tropical fruits. Tastes follows a bit more bitter, with flavors of grapefruit, papaya, toasty biscuits, and a little burnt caramel. Body is creamy and smooth, perhaps a little less carbonated than I generally like, but enjoyable as it is, and very easy to drink.	4.25
341	Juice Machine	"Canned 04/12/19, it pours cloudy gold/sand color with a 2 finger thick creamy head that was off white with lots of tiny bubbles in the head, dissipating very, very slowly and leaving outstanding thick foamy lacing clinging to the glass and leaving rings as it went down. Two weeks old and it still smells super dank with tons of topical notes, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange juice, papaya, lemon, lime, pear, orange peel, tangerine, piney hops, light peppery spices, light biscuit and more fruity notes like Orangina soda. Wow, what a start to this brew.. Tastes pretty damn dank too, with everything listed in the smell above plus gummy bears, peach, Razzles candy, a dash of brown sugar, orange creamsicle and faint toasted grains. No sign of the ABV, and the balance is near perfect with a sharp bitterness quickly washing away and replaced by lingering citrus fruit notes. One of the best I've ever had from Tree House, this is world class and really easy to drink.. 07/19/19-Had another can dated 07/02/19 and it was as impressive in every way as the first can I had. The ""Feel"" is actually better with a can this fresh, going down easy and masking the ABV perfectly."	4.78
342	Juice Machine	"L - brown orange color. Not attractive
S - little hops, little juice. Not super vibrant
T - not much. Little bitter, slightly fruity like Julius.
F - nice mouth feel for the style. Very soft.
O - does not live up to the hype. Rather have just a Julius or green"	3.66
343	Juice Machine	16oz can, just under 2 weeks old, Tree House snifter glass. Pours a bright hazy orange yellow body, one and half finger thick white head, frothy and substantial, tons of lacing all over. Appearance doesn't get much better. Smell is tropical fruit, papaya, big grapefruit, mild caramel sweetness, touch of sugary malt, but for the most part, the herbal and fruity hops shine here. Slight spicy resin as well. Flavour follows- it's a super hop-forward profile, with a fairly minimal caramel and grainy malt backbone, which is the way it should be. Big grapefruit and tropical fruit- papaya, light melon, touch of pine and spicy resin. It hits all the right notes, except for satisfying the massive hype behind this. Medium bodied, creamy and soft bodied yet substantial. A beer that is overall excellent but must be graded against its relative hype- and most people have access to local DIPAs that are half as good for 10% of what it costs to get this beer. It's a matter of relative worth and I think that while this beer is excellent, 100% of the people reading this review will be fine never having had this beer.	4.52
344	Juice Machine	A fresh can dated 4/12/19 so only 2 weeks old. Poured into a Tree House tulip.. Look- A dark dingy orange color with about a finger of fluffy white head. Great lacing around the glass.. Smell- An interesting fruit explosion of mango, pineapple, papaya, peach and hint of grapefruit. Each flavor seemed to compliment the other and mix was great..  752 characters	4.74
345	Juice Machine	Canned 4/12/19, about a week ago. . A: Pours a dull, opaque, medium orange with a finger of delicate, fine, fluffy white head.  Excellent retention and swaths of generous lacing. . S: Super aromatic, the aroma hits you from a foot away.  Tangerine, pink grapefruit, pineapple, and mild dried flowers..  813 characters	4.71
346	Juice Machine	"Alright this may be the best IPA I've had in my life. Not entirely sure. I have one more to drink then ill decide.. Perfect orange haze, perfect white foam and a lotta lacing.. Nose is mango, grapefruit, hops, lemon zest. Taste is a sweet melon and citrus that is so smooth and balanced with the heavy hops that linger on in the finish. Like i cannot emphasize the word ""balance"" enough. Like the limit does not exist as some great weightlifters say. This is one of those limits that doesnt exist. Everything is perfect here. The body, the taste, the finish. I mean holy actual fuck."	4.8
347	Juice Machine	"Canned 4 days ago.. L — The usual hazy orange Tree House hue, with a slightly smaller than usual fluffy white head produced with moderate pour. Decent retention and great lacing
S — Mango, papaya, peach, banana, bubblegum, strawberry, pineapple, hint of fusels
T — Lots of mango, papaya, bubblegum, overripe banana, and sweet floral alongside a decently strong citrus-rind bitterness and some light pepperiness from the yeast. More complex than Julius/KJ and a little more bitter too
F — Has the usual creamy, soft mouthfeel one can reliably expect from Tree House hoppy offerings. So pleasant
O — The name captures the spirit of this beer very nicely
Juice Machine > Very Green > King Julius. 95/100"	4.75
348	Juice Machine	Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is a very nice citrus. Taste is a very creamy citrus that has a great texture.	4.54
349	Juice Machine	Killer aroma, great mouth feel, flavors that back all of that up on the palette. Honestly this is on par with all of the great IPAs we have seen from Treehouse	4.66
350	Pliny The Elder	Very pleased to have a generous sample of Pliny the Elder during Zwanze Day bottle share at Fonta Flora in NC. Crisp, balanced, placed into its own style of IPA. Not really overpowering west coast and certainly not a NEIPA. Could drink this all day long, which is scary for 8%-er.	4.75
351	Pliny The Elder	"Bottled 091919.. L: Pours a crystal clear straw color with large off-white head that lasts a very long time and leaves a good lacing.
S: Floral with a bit of citrus and pine. Very clean smell.
T: Citrus on the front, pine on the back and nice long but mild bitter finish. Nothing too powerful and nothing really wants to take center stage. Very clean flavors in a very nice balance.
F: Lighter and softer than I would expect. Not at all syrupy which is a problem with many IPAs. Good carbonation.. I'm pleasantly surprised. I used to drink Pliny regularly over 6 years ago when they distributed to WA and loved it, but the last time I had it a couple years ago it wasn't as good as I had remembered. Given this bottle is a bit older, I expected more of the same but instead I got the Pliny I used to love. This is the classic west coast IPA executed to perfection."	4.65
352	Pliny The Elder	"bottle (into glass)
Bottled 2½ months ago.
Light, nearly clear amber color. Thick, rocky white head. Caramelized malt, floral and slight mandarin orange peel notes in the aroma. No trace of the 8% alcohol by volume to introduce the taste. Moderate floral hop bite floating on top of a non sweet caramelized malt foundation. Finish fades well into a floral character with a hint of malt/tangerine peel.
A fine brew indeed!"	4.3
353	Pliny The Elder	One of the most pleasurable IPA that I have ever had. It is so well balances and has a great aroma and flavor. If you have never tried this....do yourself a favor, do!	4.89
354	Pliny The Elder	In Sonoma, CA, in a pint glass. Blah blah, all the stuff that's been said before. I looked this beer up on Beer Advocate before purchasing at a restaurant and was staggered by the reviews. I was pretty excited to try it, but expected to be disappointed.. Wow...one of the best beers I have ever had. I could describe the look, nose, flavors and mouthfeel to you, but others have described this beer more than adequately before me. And truthfully, nothing does this beer justice short of drinking one. If you have the opportunity, absolutely drink one (or I suspect 2+) of these. Really damn delicious.	4.9
355	Pliny The Elder	Pours golden with chill haze. Floral nose. There's strawberry and grapefruit. It has remarkably clean flavors and none of the oniony character. The bitterness is clean. This is still a terrific and well-made IPA. Flavor wise, it is clean and well-engineered, but doesn't stand up as strong versus other legacy IPAs like Heady.	4.25
356	Pliny The Elder	"Having first had this years ago, it's nice to come back to and be reminded why it's still the ""gold standard"" IPA for me. Beautiful golden color, decent head and lacing. The smell is, I can't find the right words: pure? Golden? Wonderful?
It's the taste that sets it apart, though. Perfect blend of hops and maltiness. Citrusy and floral, and just the right amount of bitterness. My top-rated brew for a reason."	4.93
357	Pliny The Elder	Here in the UK, Pliny is a true rarity. Finally managed to get my hands on one bottle, thanks to a friend making the pilgrimage to RR. Shared it with my Dad in our micro brewery, while brewing our cloned version.. An appealing visual golden liquid, but the scent and taste; shouting grapefruit, was what we both commented on. The real thing knocks the socks off our Tiny Pliny clone.	4.74
358	Pliny The Elder	A good beer, with a lot of subtlety and smoothness (I've enjoyed it a number of times). That said, it's one of the more overrated beers I've had for the cost, and it's an example of how critical popularity can affect people's opinions of quality. For a much lower price, Racer 5 or Sculpin are just about as good and more widely available in California.	4.43
359	Pliny The Elder	I was only ever able to snag one bottle of this from a friend that brought one back from Cali. I will have to say, this one has reset the bar for IPA's for me. For years I thought Bell's Two Hearted was the defacto standard for IPA's. Not any more! This stuff is amazing. Just the right maltiness to balance out the relative high ABV. And the hops....OMG, where do I start? I have brewed clones of this in the past that were pretty good. If the scale went this high, I would rate it a 10!	4.81
360	Pliny The Elder	"Being from Chicago, this beer was just a rumor. The times I have been to California, the story was always that RR shrank its distro area, didn't go here, didn't go there . . . so naturally I find two bottles for sale in the Colorado mountains having randomly stopped in a gas station/liq store for a Coke. I actually gasped when I saw it, like finding a soundboard Nirvana bootleg from the concert you attended.. It's a solid ale. Didn't look for the dating, but knowing ales it certainly tasted fresh. Ten years ago, I might have spread the Good News. But for the price, I'll look elsewhere next time. And I have several $20/4-packs that I return to despite bargaining with myself not to. Reminds me of Sculpin, in the above-average beer, way overpriced category. Not being contrarian; not saying ""I don't get it."" Just too much time has passed and too many brewers have caught up. Back in Chicago, cases of Zombie Dust are bypassed at Whole Foods and Binnys. (In a Budweiser world, kind of makes you appreciate Dom and Blue Label's perseverance. By the time I finally had Pappy, I was really impressed.) Pliny is a 70s film like The Conversation or Network, an album like Exile on Main Street or '77 that is obviously a benchmark, but doesn't stir the soul the way it maybe once would have. I'd go to the brewery and have it on draft for sure."	4.15
361	Pliny The Elder	"I was on a road trip last month and happened to befriend some cool peeps in San Fransisco. They told me about this brewery and how they make the 'best IPA in North America.' Intrigued by their comments, I made a pit stop in Santa Rosa and went to a few breweries in the area before trying Russian River. I'm not a fan of restaurant/breweries, but I must admit, it was a fun atmosphere. When I ordered this beer I thought to myself, ""this is the best IPA NA has to offer? LOL!"" Then I brought that golden glass of goodness to my nasal passages and was pleased with the scent. The only thing left to do was let my palate have a little action, perhaps too much by the end of my evening. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth this IPA was. I do wish there was more of a carbonation texture, but this is nitpicking. Incredibly balanced IPA and I have been searching for it ever since finishing my road trip. I also heard they make a small batch called Pliny the Younger and apparently puts this to shame..."	4.86
362	Pliny The Elder	This is still the pinnacle of IPA's. I still would stand in line to get it, and it still still what I rate everything else by it. Nothing to me has unseated it yet.	4.85
363	Pliny The Elder	Bottled 3/25/14; drank 5/4/14 @ the Yarchives.. Clear orange/yellow hue.. Off-white head; nice lace..  272 characters	4
364	Pliny The Elder	Finally nabbed this unicorn at Monk's in Philly, on draft. Everything i expected to be. Texture of this beer is amazing, its head retention and lacing on point, taste was bold with hop flavor, but smooth like a double should be.	4.69
365	Pliny The Elder	Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.. Aroma is a lovely pungent array of bright fresh pine, orangey citrus, with some floral notes - orange blossom, honeysuckle, and a hint of bright fresh cut lemon grass. While the hops are quite aromatic, there is a balance to this as there is a definite light malt backbone coming through even on the nose.. Taste is follows the nose with notes of citrus - lemon, orange, tangerine and orange rind - along with fresh pine and a bright floral notes. Solid cracker-y malt backbone comes through. Incredibly balanced and restrained while still being flavorful and complex. Mild bitterness on the back end with some more piney notes coming through. The classic west coast profile comes through here but without trying to punch you in the palate..  1,366 characters	4.5
366	Pliny The Elder	Imagine my surprise to see this on draft when walking into a bar in Philly. Apparently, the only bar to serve this on draft (in a very limited supply) is the one I was in. I had three glasses. This was one of the original craft beer unicorns ... and for good reason. It's great!. I will say that beers have since started to catch up and I don't consider this to be an enlightening experience ... several good IPAs I've had are as good or better. Having said that, this IS an IPA to write home about and it's as perfect a double IPA as you'll find.. 5-7 years ago I'd be doing cartwheels and rating this a 5 across the board. Today, it's a very good IPA ... one of the best. Still hard to find, even in CA! I think the hype surrounding this and it's February release with lines around the block, ticket lotteries and strict one beer per person limits brought this notoriety and high ratings..  1,687 characters	4.6
367	Pliny The Elder	A massive thanks and appreciation to Tim for giving me the chance to finally try this beer. This was a big-time want for me. Still, like all of my reviews, I strive to remain as objective as possible, resisting hype or other influences, and everything I write is done in real-time stream of consciousness format.. 500ml bottle - dated 060519 - poured into a large wine stem at 44F.. Pours a stunning clear deep honey golden, with a finger of fluffy bone white head, perforated with rings of air pockets, and leaving spots of lacing clinging to the glass..  4,632 characters	4.61
368	Pliny The Elder	My white-whale, finally obtained. Overall, Pliny's a solid DIPA,but truth be told, there are equally as good out there without having to drive an hour to Palm Springs to get...IMHO, but glad I did!!	4
369	Pliny The Elder	"Bottled on 5/29/19
Drank on 6/24/19 and 6/25/19. Worthy of the hype. Extremely balanced. Hides booze tremendously. Poured a golden yellow with a 2"" head, impeccable lacing.. Piney hops in the nose, followed by floral notes that fade to orange peel, then bready malts. Taste follows the nose to a T. As it warms I get a tad bit of gumball (maybe the simcoe) and the orange peel takes on more of a mango/stone fruit vibe..  683 characters"	4.89
370	Pliny The Elder	The best West Coast Double IPA I've ever had. A classic and has always stayed true to the style.. Pours a beautiful rich golden color with the perfect amount of head if at the right temperature. Has really nice lacing that sticks around.. Smell has lots of pine, stone fruits, and dankness. The nose is really pleasant. Luckily, the taste follows the nose..  945 characters	4.96
371	Pliny The Elder	Being from Boston, all I could ever do was read about this beer. We were driving through Santa Rosa so I stopped at Russian River and bought a couple of pints.. This pours a golden clear color with a slowly diminishing white head. Medium carbonation. Hoppy with pine and citrus notes. Slightly bitter. Light bodied, crisp and very drinkable. Hides the alcohol well.. World class! Wish that I had more space in my suitcase for more bottles!	4.37
372	Pliny The Elder	Bottle a friend shared on Jun 13, 2019. Believe it’s about 3-4 months old. Poured into a pint glass.. Pour: beautiful, rich golden color. Small head that dissipated pretty quickly. Some clouds and lacing.. Nose: lots of citrus, some pine, some floral. A little bread as well..  811 characters	4.49
373	Pliny The Elder	Bright gold with a moderate head that sticks around for a few minutes before giving way to thin film that laces as consumed.. Gentle aromas. Stone fruit, slight dankness, a hint of bubble gum.. Citrus on the tongue with some piney hops and a very little dankness. Pleasantly bitter throughout..  428 characters	4.71
374	Pliny The Elder	Pliny is the perfect pour - a classic golden, slightly haze body with a frothy white head that leaves copious lacing. The smell is citrus with a musty back. It tastes of hops and more hops with a citrus zest, leaving a clean refreshing mouth feel. Pliny is near the top of Big Beer Mountain. Grab it when you can.	4.68
375	Fou' Foune	"Drank at the brewery.
Hazy amber peachy color with a thin head.
Nice peachy aroma, fresh mint and orange lemon citrusy.
Flavor with notes of peaches, lemon, spices, wood, herbal hops and lactic acid. Dry and sour aftertaste.
Light body with mild carbonation.
One of my preferred beer from them. This was perfectly balanced with peaches at the right level, still keeping Lambic in the spotlight. Excellent."	4.47
376	Fou' Foune	Look - Pours a very hazy orange/peach color, with a very nice head and great lacing.. Smell - Has a subdued smell of sour apricot with a bit of funk.. Taste - Tastes of sour apricot; not the sourest I've tried, but perhaps a bit sourer than I'd prefer..  392 characters	4.18
377	Fou' Foune	750ml bottle decanted into small snifters.. Golden-orange in color with good clarity. Bracing tartness on the attack, but as the initial shock to the palate subsides, it opens into bright and beautiful flavors of fresh apricots, orange blossom and floral notes, and a very delicate and nuanced funk layer. Soft oak to round things out. It’s so fucking good. Completely captivating in its fresh and lively fruit flavor and in its balance. This is a personal favorite of mine, and one of the very few beers that I will begrudgingly admit lives up to the hype and then some. It’s a real treat to savor on the rare occasions it can be had.	4.61
378	Fou' Foune	Enjoyed from bottle at Brasserie Cantillon. Modestly hazy and apricot-colored, with as much head on it as you care to produce when pouring. Bursting with fruit, moderate tartness and a touch of sour funk. Easy to see why this can be rated as the best Belgian fruit lambic around.	4.58
379	Fou' Foune	Poured into Teku. 2017 vintage.. Clear and golden straw colored with thin off-white foamy head. Settles into floating small bubbled island and thin collar of bubbly foam.. Aroma is bright tart fruit mixed with a layer of overripe/fermented apricot. Minor but persistent funk, a hint of white wine grape and some earthy/grass/wood notes..  481 characters	4.66
380	Fou' Foune	Right up front I will say that I am not a huge fan of sour beers. I find them a bit bracing and not the kind of beer I enjoy drinking. Having said that, I do find them an interesting category and this one, while a bit puckering, was not as sour as some of the sour beers I've tried.. It has almost a champagne shandy type of mouthfeel/taste. It's light and crisp the way a champagne is and has a similar carbonated consistency. The color is nice with a dark yellow color and little bubbles which fizz within it.. The taste is a very fermented peach flavor. Tart and acidic but not so much so that you lose the nuances of the apricot/peach. I did something I never do with a sour and had a glass and a half of this in one sitting. Probably more to do with the price and scarcity than the taste. As rare as this is, I probably won't get another chance to try it ... and I am actually quite okay with that..  1,385 characters	4.16
381	Fou' Foune	2018 bottle sampled from a plastic cup at midnight in the parking lot of Forager Brewing awaiting Nillerzzzzz/Crema release the next morning. I can understand why someone might like this style of beer but the sour notes of the Belgian Fruit Lambics just are not my thing.	3.6
382	Fou' Foune	Clear and gold. Small but satisfactory white head. Smells of all the apricots: fresh, dried, jam, pickled. Gorgeous. Got that medicinal barnyard funk but not too much. Exceptional apricot flavour, but with a certain dank turn towards sea buckthorn and pickle brine. Bone dry and perfectly sour: tart, not heartburny. A fantastic lambic and I can’t wait to drink it again.	4.72
383	Fou' Foune	Bottled 8/26/15; drank 8/13/16 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Opaque orange appearance.. Small bright white head; minimal lace..  315 characters	4.44
384	Fou' Foune	This is a world-class beer all the way around. The apricots and earthiness mingle well together and the slight hint of tartness are amazing...This is a 2011 edition and it is drinking incredibly right now. I have to admit that I never thought I would ever lay eyes on this but I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this. It is simply amazing. I love the way that the sweetness of the fruits and the tartness of the beer play against one another here. I am very fortunate to be able to have had a chance to give this one a go. If you ever run across this I would highly highly highly recommend it. It is simply incredible...	4.66
385	Fou' Foune	"2015 vintage.
Aroma is herbal and stone fruit with the flavor surprisingly crackery-baguette malty with apricot-peach coming through mostly in the late palate and finish. Dry and light with incredible drinkability."	4.22
386	Fou' Foune	People differ in opinion, but I loved the fruity, tart, bitter and slightly funky flavor.. Look: Hazy golden with a thin white head. Aroma: tart green apples and apricot.  354 characters	4.66
387	Fou' Foune	750 ml bottle drank at the Brewery in Brussels. poured into Cantillon 25cl stemmed glass. pours a bright clear orange / peach color, thin white head that fades. nice pleasant aroma of appricots, mild tartness. similar taste, not overly sour and refreshing to drink. thin bodied, lively carbonation works for it.	4.45
388	Fou' Foune	Tap @ Moor, Bristol, Zwanze Day 2018 - Pours hazy orange with a small white foamy head. Aroma - Sour, unripe fruits - apricot, peach notes, woody feel. Taste - Tart, fruits - apricot, grassy notes, dry sour finish. Drinks really well with a nice sour fruit balance.	4.5
389	Fou' Foune	Tasted from bottle. Pours a hazy orange with nice head. Fruity aroma with citrus notes. Flavors of apricot, orange and some sour funk. Crisp and easily crushable. Not overly sour. Incredible.	4.86
390	Fou' Foune	04/2014 - The nose is notably tart, a touch yeasty, yet notable peach and apricots; funky, lactic, pucker all over the palate, with juicy fruit lasting and lasting; there's a unique bitterness in back, but the aforementioned characteristics, namely the the peach and lactic linger.	4.61
391	Fou' Foune	Had on tap. Finally got to try this lambic, was skeptical of the praise, but wow this was amazing! The apricot just explodes onto the palate on the finish with supporting flowers, hay, candi sugar, peach jam, pear, and funky yeast. So much fullness of flavor while maintaining a light, delicate and exception mouthfeel. Smell is not as vibrant, yet does put the spotlight on the apricot and peach yogurt (yeast) aromas. Pours bright gold with plenty of white foam, amazing lambic! Despite my doubts, the hype is real!	4.69
392	Fou' Foune	Pours and orangish-straw with a light haze and fog. Head foams up to two fingers in height straight from the bottle and retains fairly well. Aroma is peach with a light acidic straw backbone. Flavor profile is a jam-like peach notes, spread over notes of wheat and bread. Splendid smoothness. Mouth feel is smooth with a medium thickness. Overall, simply amazing. It's a kin to spreading a peach jam on bread.. Reviewed from notes. Served into a stemmed glass from a 750mL bottle.	4.65
393	Fou' Foune	"Extremely well balanced lambic.
Appearance: Orange
Nose: Apricot, Peach
Mouth: Some sourness, but overall very drinkable
Overall: Extremely solid offering, but very expensive if you are buying in the USA."	4.75
394	Fou' Foune	This beer is as close to perfect as anything I've ever had. I will never stop thinking about it. I have nothing to add to any review, other than my input that this is tremendous.	4.9
395	Fou' Foune	2017 vintage (1 year old) purchased at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Poured at room temperature, essentially.. The look is semi-hazy light orange with a ring of white head.. The nose is apricot, pear, peach, and funk..  490 characters	4.63
396	Fou' Foune	First fresh foune (2017). Beautiful fruit lambic with standard cantillon mineral undertones, soft acidity and tartness, thick ripe appricot. Definitely get the “yoghurtiness” others have described. Would still be interested to stick a few years on it to see how the fruit charecter develops	4.54
397	Fou' Foune	For a special occasion, this is Cantillon's greatest offering. Justifies making the pilgrimage if a sour fan and even those who are more wine enthusiast will love Fou' Foune. Is a gold yellow with slight haze. Tastes of peaches, nuanced funk, balanced sourness, and a champagne effervescence. Enjoyed at the brewery in Brussels with family and new friends and really would not have it any other way.	5
398	Fou' Foune	"**REVIEW NUMBER 1,300**
:and:
**BEER ADVOCATE BEER NUMBER 1,956**. Reviewed from notes. 2014 cork dating. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a J. Wakefield OG teku glass.. A: Hazy gold with a big three-finger white head, though this fades fairly quickly. Low visible carbonation after the intial blush diminishes..  1,194 characters"	4.38
399	Fou' Foune	Pours a hazy, straw coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by sour funk, with some apricot and just a hint of citrus zest coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by barnyard funk and hints of apricot and citrus. There's a light estery yeast note and a certain earthy and slightly spicy note to this as well. Finishes very dry and acidic, with only a little sweetness coming through, and another mouth-puckering dose of tartness. Medium body and carbonation. I really didn't feel that this has a very rich, fruity apricot note to it at all, maybe it's the vintage (2017, I believe). The apricot is there, but quite subdued and overshadowed by the strong, funky sourness and citric acidity. This is a very nice lambic without a doubt, but highly overrated in my opinion, as it is neither especially subtle nor complex.	4.1
400	Assassin	"Surprise on tap at brewery July 26
Look - jet black with brown edge on glass
Smell - holy cow!! Huge smell and such a punch!! Amazing!
Taste - this stout blows me away, such a chocolate punch!
Feel - very very thick, must sip little by little!
Overall - a knock out!! Mornin Delight and I assume KBBS are only better because they have a sweeter taste to them. Hope to try KBBS soon! Coming in Dec for another release."	5
401	Assassin	Purple wax, 2016, shared with friends.. Black, sticky, thin head of deep tan. Settles into a few thin bubbles.. Aroma is rich and substantial booze, roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, toffee..  495 characters	4.64
402	Assassin	2014 vintage...may 26th 2019....this is amazing! Every sip is a different experience. flavors all over the place. maple? vanilla? chocolate? Not nearly the viscosity of Sr-71 but LEAGUES ahead of all around! Worth trying.	4.81
403	Assassin	'13 vintage (yellow wax). Pours like SR71 b1 thick 5W-30 motor-oil viscosity. Upfront chocolate fudge, with a hint of black licorice and bourbon. Mouthfeel coats the tongue and teeth after each sip, 9/10 viscosity level. Absolutely amazing beer if it was drank fresh or properly cellared. This was drank early May of 2019.	4.84
404	Assassin	2014 Gold Wax. I’m tasting Carmel, bourbon, black licorice, vanilla. Lucky enough to drink the whole bottle myself. Barely any carbonation at this point. Extremely delicious! Yum yum	4.62
405	Assassin	"Dark black pour, lacing for days.. Cherry and birch bark on the nose. Smells more like a quad.. The awesome texture on the front of the tongue is quickly assaulted by liquorice, anaise, and anything else you might taste after opening up a package of black Twizlers candy.
It coats the mouth, throat, lungs, belly, all the way down to my big toe.
Each additional sip seems to enhance the assault. Were it not for the heavy price I’d paid for this bottle, I would not want to finish it.
This drinks hotter/more painful than most 18-20% stouts. But as a glutton for punishment, I’m very disappointed in this one."	3.91
406	Assassin	03/2015 - This is absolutely incredible - the nose is big bourbon, dark chocolate, roast, and some vanilla, too; the mouthfeel is velvety, luscious, and full on whiskey, yet there isn't any ethanol; the finish slightly sweet, yet the roast and barrel linger in a wonderful union that lasts and lasts.	4.88
407	Assassin	2018 release (orange wax).. A: Pours absolutely jet black with a thin cap of dark brown head. A couple streaks of lacing and pretty good retention for something this big.. S: Rich dark chocolate bar, dark dried fruit, sweet vanilla bean ice cream, light oak char and whiskey. A bit of an alcohol burn on the nose..  837 characters	4.31
408	Assassin	Really good beer - solid and enjoyable but I'm glad I had a buddy who got a bottle on the cheap n shared. If I did what it normally takes to score this I would have been very disappointed. Smells boozy and tastes the same. Decent flavor but not great. The booze just over took everything else. I'm glad I got to try it but won't go crazy getting more.	4.44
409	Assassin	Wow, very disappointed in this one. I would never do secondary value on this, and probably not even MSRP. It was like soy sauce honestly, glad to have tried it, but much better BA Stouts out there for a much better price, straight up hype train in my opinion.	1.86
410	Assassin	Orange wax. The nose is great and is full of rich chocolate brownie batter with a touch of barrel. The taste doesn’t transition though. There is a ton of dark fruit and dark cherry on the palette. The dark fruit overwhelms the other notes in this beer and pushes them into the distant background like the big brownie batter note that was dominant on the nose. The mouthfeel is full and verges on chewy. Overall this beer is pretty good, but falls short of the hype by quit a lot.	4.38
411	Assassin	Huge thanks to David for this gem. Decent foamy black head, pitch black beer, long legs. Nose super dark malt, big dark chocolate, fudgey cocoa, roast, coffee, little caramel nougat.  579 characters	4.59
412	Assassin	Whiskey Barrel, dark chocolate and cherry on the nose. Very thick mouthfeel with raisins coming through on the sip. Finishes with burnt sugar and chewy chocolate. Impressive non adjunct stout here!	4.64
413	Assassin	The 2018 version (Orange Wax Version) but my review is a draft pour from Toppling Goliath on release day, Mar. 31, 2018.. Look- A 4 oz. pour (that is what they had) into a taster glass. A deep dark black with no head and sticky thick. It just stuck to the glass.. Smell- Chocolate was super strong with a hint of the barrel mixed in. After a sip, the dark fruits and especially raisins came through. It was amazing..  918 characters	4.85
414	Assassin	Rating applies to 2018 (orange wax) Assassin.. Barrel is quite prominently present. Nose is laden with loads of dark fruit. Taste similarly reflective of dark fruit. I found myself quite surprised. At least while cool, the beer is not incredibly thick and doesn't have a ton of character other than dark fruit and barrel.. But I had another pour later, possibly deeper in to the keg - this pour was significantly thicker, oilier, and richer (nose, taste, and mouth feel). It still consisted of too much dark fruit for my liking, but it was much better. I'm still slightly puzzled by the difference in those two pours..  900 characters	4.17
415	Assassin	2014, gold wax. Dark chocolate, cocoa, brownie batter, oak, dark fruits and bourbon. Straight fudge. Awesome mouthfeel. Luxuriously thick and rich. Underlying bitter bite on the finish. Sweetness has mellowed and this has dried out. Still decently boozy. Very good. A bit of oxidation has crept in thou. I'd drink now.	4.56
416	Assassin	I also had a chance to taste the 2018 batch (orange wax) today at Julio's poured by Clark Lewey. Tough to gauge look in small taster but looks super dark and sludgy. Smell is chocolate, sweet bourbon, some tobacco. Taste is chocolate, dark fruits and some roastiness. Also bourbon sweetness, but overall pretty subdued. Not much in the way of booziness. Medium mouthfeel with some good stickiness. Super excited that I got to try this.	4.81
417	Assassin	Got he opportunity to sample the 2018 batch before it was officially released at a tasting at julios Liquors. Very tasty tasty with big dark chocolate notes. A little on the thin side but delish nonetheless.	4.48
418	Assassin	"Assassin range a lot, this rating is based on the 2014 pappy aged assassin.. 2014=4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 4.5, 4.75 (4.73)
2016=4.5, 4.75, 4.5, 4.25, 4.5 (4.54)
2018=4.5, 4.5, 4.75, 4.5, 4.5 (4.6). Look: thin khaki head and motor oil black
Smell: milk chocolate, carnal, malt and some bourbon
Taste: milk chocolate, carnal, bourbon and dried fruit
Feel: thick and heavy, oil like... strong bourbon finish."	4.73
419	Assassin	2016 vintage; drank 6/2/17 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Black/brown appearance.. Minimal dark tan head; minimal lace..  359 characters	4.75
420	Assassin	Gold Wax.. Wow, amazing Barrel character, perfect mouthfeel. Luxurious beer.. Orange Wax.  453 characters	4.99
421	Assassin	2016 Batch Pour from Iowa Craft Beer Festival in Des Moines, IA.. Thick, Stick Bourbon. Pitch black with dark khaki head which subsides rather quickly. One of the thickest stouts I have drank in relation to mouthfeel. Amazing beer!!!	4.5
422	Assassin	"Purple Wax. Highly disappointed with this beer based upon the hype leading up to it. Its not a bad beer, just not nearly worth the effort to aquire it. It has great color,body and mouthfeel. The bourbon lays a little heavy (nose and palate) and creates an distracting imbalance. It was almost a clone of Olde Hickory's Event Horizon minus a couple abv points.
Overall, save your time, effort and money. Drink Event Horizon instead. Its available year round at $15 a bottle and tastes slightly better."	4.29
423	Assassin	Thing pours like tar and packs a massive punch. I split a bottle of the 2017 release with two friends and we were lights out. This beer resembles Dark Lord more than anything else, and honestly I think they're interchangeable. Get some if you can!	4.76
424	Assassin	Purple wax.. This was certainly a treat. Pours a thick, jet-black liquid, amber head with moderate carbonation. The nose was big, very aromatic notes of berries and dried fruit. The taste follows the nose, a complex mixture of berries (raspberries and blackberries) and dried fruit (figs, plums, and dates). Thick full body.. Did this stout live up to the hype - no - but it had a very high bar. With that said it was awesome. I enjoyed the complex flavor that was created from the barrel, malt bill, and serious skillz. It was reminiscent of BC Backyard, but without the fruit adjuncts. Very well crafted!!	4.67
425	Very Green	If the adult in you ever wanted an imperial strength orange juice, Tree House has the IPA for you: a New England, stronger than usual offering that promises fruitiness, dankness and and hoppiness to screwdrive their point home.. Expounding on their flagship IPA, Green, Very Green pours a nearly gray-ish goldenrod equipped with a matte finish and a pastel tone. Underneath its slightly tarnish froth lies a scent of citrus, spice, green and botanicals that tease the nose with a friendly fruitiness but also a grassy dankness. Its sweet palate is chocked full of pastry dough, light honey and cereal grain to soothe the early palate before the hops arrive.. And once they do, a rip-roaring taste of freshly squeezed orange juice hints toward the tropical punch side with pineapple and lime. As the hops quickly overcome the middle palate, the fruitiness turns pleasantly spicy with hemp, hay, chive, geranium, peppery grasses and an overall herbaceous array. Its moderate bitterness balances to the biting side of hops more than do most of their IPA, but the dryness that it brings is welcomed..  1,422 characters	4.46
426	Very Green	poured into a pint glass via can. color is a nice hazy yellow/orange. smell is an amped up version of Green..pungent as heck..sweet citrus.  317 characters	4.55
427	Very Green	16oz can, dated 09.04.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 09.21.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a very hazy and turbid bright golden color, amber hues with a foamy white head that has decent retention and lacing. The aroma is excellent, super green, bitter resinous pine, grassy, dank weed, floral with some fragrant grapefruit peel, tropical orange and pineapple with sweet yeast and pale dough. The flavors follow the nose well, bursting with raw green hop, hop oil, resinous and bitter pine, hop spice, grapefruit peel brings out a bit of tropical pineapple and mango with a nice bed of cereal grains. The mouthfeel is good, coating and bright medium body, lively texture with a dry finish.. Verdict: A great IIPA from Tree House. Green is probably my favorite staple IPA from Tree House and this is an excellent version of that beer. Hard to go wrong with either, the extra booze in this one is probably a slight detractor in the end.	4.46
428	Very Green	"Look exactly what I want an IPA to look like. Pillow like and yellow orange. Smell Man o man I have rarely smelled a beer that was so good. The pungency is out of this world. a smell of almost sour but so enticing . Reminiscent of Green but taken to another level but not better or worse.
Taste Sour grapefruit pithy perfect, sweet aftertaste back to bitter dry.
Feel. Forget about it.Typical feathery Treehouse yeasty overload goodness.
Overall . Some of the best you will ever come across for me. Everything a double IPA should aspire to be"	4.86
429	Very Green	Absolutely incredible NE style IPA from the always amazing Tree House. This one was one of my favorites from their extensive list. Canned date 8/4/19. Looks incredible, hazy yellow-orange turbulent color with some fluffy white head and beautiful lasting rings of lingering lacing that stayed put throughout the entire beer. Hard to beat. Smells great, deep ripe fruity hops - tangerine, grapefruit, mango, lemon, pineapple, melon, guava, passion fruit - as well as malt, piney and floral hops, caramel, bread and creamy vanilla. Taste follows the nose, excellent balance (as always) between the juicy fruity hop bomb and the sweeter malt backbone with that great creamy vanilla backing it up. Higher ABV so well hidden. The mouthfeel was just out of this world, creamy, juicy, smooth, sticky, luscious, coats the palate. One of the best I've ever tried. Just the right amount of carbonation. I will keep on my quest to try as many of their beers as I can.	4.64
430	Very Green	"Canned 09/04/19 “the sweetest juice”
Been waiting years to try this one since having Green and imagining a doubly delicious version. Not far off, it turns out, because this is simply stellar. Most NEIPAs and a majority of TH beers are juice bombs, but wow, this is a juice meteor! Honestly can’t imagine freshly picked citrus tasting better than this. Viscous, almost pulpy feel and perfectly bittersweet yet dry in the finish. This one exceeds the hype."	4.77
431	Very Green	Its hard living near Treehouse because you tend to get spoiled with the ready availability of their beers. I have to admit, while there's nothing wrong with Very Green, it's not one that completely blows people away either. For all the gushing I've had guests do about the Juice Machine or King Julius I gave them, Very Green gets a fairly standard, 'It was very good.'. I think this is the new normal of how a good double IPA should drink. While it's not a showstopper, it is a great beer that has the lemon rhind, pine and light floral flavors loaded into a juicy IPA which is standard OP of TH. There is a bit of a mango note and overly ripe pineapple which comes out after you swallow the sip. The look is that of a Treehouse beer ... a cloudy and translucent orange-yellow color with a nice mouthfeel and a very small foamy head.. I will say, while a great beer that any brewer would like to put their name on, when I saw the high reviews and then tasted the beer ... my first thought was that Treehouse was getting very predictable and it's high ratings may have to do more with the ingenious timing of the rationing/availability of certain beers vs. one beer actually being that much better than another..  1,306 characters	4.55
432	Very Green	"Canned 7/23/19, enjoyed in a tulip shifter
Murky matte golden straw, admits little light. 1.5 finger of white fine bubbled head. Full lacing, well capped.
Smell: Initially various citrus, pineapple, mango, light Swiss cheese, melon, yeast mustiness.
Taste: Sweet tangelo, mango, light sweet pepper. With some warming, mango, pineapple, cantaloupe predominate.
Feel: soft mouthfeel, consistent carbonation, dry finish, slight kick of bitterness at the end. Fruits come on as the glass warms.
More vivid citrus flavors than regular Green, but not as balanced. Super."	4.78
433	Very Green	"Quicker review, on tap at Tree House
Look (4.5): Super opaque orange yellow, one finger head
Smell (4.5): citrusy and nice hops forward
Taste (4.25): citrusy, very hoppy, but easy to crush
Feel (4.5): nice body, super smooth
Overall: 4.5"	4.4
434	Very Green	Poured from a 16oz. can into a plastic cup (hey, we're on the driveway drinking). Just another in a long line of wonderful IPA from TH. The aroma is amazing and the wonderfully soft finish completes the experience.	4.5
435	Very Green	I'm not a fan of Green, but this beer is a tasty treat. Good citrus nose, but the flavor just doesn't quite deliver what the aroma promises. Julius delivers. However, this beer is very rich, soft, and drinkable. Worth getting if offered.	4.25
436	Very Green	"Canned on 6/4. Poured to Glass on 6/9.
A:Light Orange, yellow colour. Finger of cloud and resess soon.
S: Orange, Pineapple and some malts aromas.
T: Pineapple and tropical fruits mixed notes with hops.
M:Smooth but has some keen edge of notes.
O: Medium body and medium Carbo. Similarity with 7.
ABV: 8.6%"	4.5
437	Very Green	-opaquely cloudy orange can pour with a heavy orange blossom bouquet and a tinge of hop dankness. The flavor is fantastic with rolling layers of citrus, mango, pineapple, guava and some melon. The brew is not too sweet and the bitterness is only moderate. The mouthfeel is very soft and smooth. This is a superb ale.	4.56
438	Very Green	“Focus on today, you’ll find a way”. Pouring from a 16 oz. can into a Tree House Willi Becher style glass, this beer pours out like a mango juice; light and bright. It forms slightly over a finger worth of white bubbles, packed tightly together to form a creamy crown. Leaves great lacing throughout.. The nose brings in huge tropical layers with a dankness. Pineapple, mango. There’s a slight pine/resin to it to counter some of the fruit..  791 characters	4.62
439	Very Green	Very Green pours a thick and murky yellow orange with an off white one finger, dense and creamy head with big lacing retention. The smell is big tropical with pineapple and mango with a sweet citrus and some hop dankness. Taste is well balanced with sweet fruit from the American hops combined with the bitterness from down under. Excellent flavor with pineapple and orange coming through with a creaminess.	4.65
440	Very Green	16 oz. can. Pours cloudy orange, just shy of murky, with a medium white head. Smells of pineapple and citrus with some alcohol and sweet pale malt. Tastes of pineapple throughout, especially as the alcohol flavor kicks in. Hefty orange citrus with a touch of sweet pale malt. Moderate alcohol kick. Big IPA, but good. I'd rather have regular Green, I think.	3.58
441	Very Green	Poured into a pint glass from a tallboy can.. L: Thick opaque golden juice pour. Thick white head... great lacing.. S: Tropical juice. Citrus, pineapple, and mango..  504 characters	4.85
442	Very Green	Hazy, pale gold and orange beer. Tall, off white head leaves a curtain of lacing. Smell is an amazing blend of tangerine, pineapple, pine, caramel, and floral hop notes. Taste is the same as the smell with a great balance of bright fruits, sweet malts and a pleasant bitter finish.	4.9
443	Very Green	TREE HOUSE VERY GREEN IPA 4/29/19. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip.. a: Opaque gold/green with an inch thick white head which receded slowly to.  747 characters	4.78
444	Very Green	When I opened a can there was a candied dankness greeted my senses like a dog greets their owner when they return home from a long day. After pouring a Golden full on haze the candied flavors open up to reveal mango, pineapple, grapefruit and bubblegum. The flavor is is all of this with a great balancing bitterness, pine flavors and light mouthfeel, that I think is what makes double ipas so great. The finish is a palate coating candied, hoppy, bitterness that makes you want another sip. One hell of a beer.	4.78
445	Very Green	If I could get more KJ, it might be my favorite NEIPA, but as it stands, VG is it. It is like a tropical paradise in a glass. If they ever brew a vvvverrrryy green- I will go full 007 with disguises to buy it all.	5
446	Very Green	Given the recent offerings, I was lucky enough to try Juice Machine, King Julius, and Very Green side by side, and all fresh.. With that being said, I was expecting Juice machine to be the best of them all, but that wasn’t the case.. Very Green is the best beer treehouse makes. Absolutely insane beer, pure juice. King Julius was a close second, and Juice Machine was sadly underwhelming (tasted like any other double they make.).  961 characters	5
447	Very Green	Another beauty from Tree House. Cloudy gold in the glass, substantial mouthfeel, good complexity as the Aussie and American hops alternately fight for your attention. Delicious citrus.	4.5
448	Very Green	Been waiting to try this one as regular Green is fantastic. As expected everything from Green amped up in a very good way. More pineapple and tropical, full, creamy. Delicious!	4.73
449	Very Green	Pours a hazy yellow with a decent head and smells like a danky pineapple. Has a delicious pineapple flavor with a hint of sweet orange but a very balanced and not overly sweet finish. Amazing!	4.71
450	Julius	"Poured from a can to a pint glass.
The canned on date was 8/29/19.
The beer poured a bright yellow/orange with two fingers of white head.
The beer was hazy as I was unable to see through the beer in my glass, which is a good thing.
The smell of the beer was grass, pine, and mango.
The taste was more mango and pine with an excellent hop bite.
The mouthfeel was creamy and not too heavy.
Overall this is an excellent example of a hazy IPA. This is one of the best I have had to date and will be the standard I judge all other hazy IPA's by."	4.61
451	Julius	This is a very good beer. I wont lie, I was kinda underwhelmed at first because if the hype, but if I strip it down and put on blinders, not listen to haw amazing this beer is, that is when I rate it at one very good beer.	4.53
452	Julius	Beautiful orange-heavy, juicy-as-hell beer with deep haze and almost no head. Nothing but sweet orange and dank grass on the nose. Not complex or layered, but gloriously juicy. Taste follows with sweet citrus juice, dank greens, pine resin, and a tropical stone fruit finish. Nice herbal notes as well. A little thin but silky smooth.. Not the most nuanced beer, and I wouldn't say I was blown away by it -- very tough for these whale beers to meet expectations. But it did not disappoint in terms of the tastiness and drinkability, and so damn flavorful for a 6% (ish) beer. Unbelievable the fruit juice notes that they can extract from different hops without using any adjuncts>	4.45
453	Julius	The color on this beer is one of the brighter that I have had. Very juicy slightly hazy, enjoyed in plastic at the brewery. Notes of orange, tangerine, and very smooth finish.	4.9
454	Julius	Phenomenal NEIPA. Easy to see why this tops the rankings for the style. Outstanding in every aspect. This was my second time trying Julius, and it's even better than the first time, probably because Ive had so many lesser NEIPAs in the interim.	4.67
455	Julius	Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Hazed juicy pour with 2 fingers of foamy white head. Outstanding lacing.. S: Orange juice and citrus. Fruity..  525 characters	4.5
456	Julius	"**
08/22/19. Can to snifter.. LOOK: Hazy yellow orange. Sturdy white head..  216 characters"	4.28
457	Julius	"Dated 1/25/19, drank on 3/1/19.
Look (4.75): really nice hazy golden yellow orange. one finger head.
Smell (4.5): sweet fruity pineapple, orange, and citrus
Taste (4.75): very crushable signature citrus, strong juiciness with balanced hops.
Feel (4.75): nice, smooth like butter, creamy medium body.
Overall 4.75"	4.69
458	Julius	"canned 08-01-19. L-The beer pours a light orangish yellow. The head is a solid three fingers high and frothy. The head recedes to a large island surrounded by a thin ring. Lacing is some of the best I've seen in a beer. It completely coats the glass.
S- The nose starts out with strong mango. Citrus in the form of orange and light grapefruit make up the balance. intensity of the nose is moderate.
T-On the palate I get a more even mix of orange and mango. The finish is lightly bitter, with a wet finish.
F- Mouthfeel overall is medium. Carbonation is light. The overall drinkability here is excellent and I could drink multiples without issue.
O-A very good NEIPA. Highly drinkable and I can see why it's rated highly. It's perhaps suffering in this review due to following Curiosity 73. I can't help but feel it's slightly overrated. That said I thoroughly recommend trying it for yourself."	4.21
459	Julius	"Maybe the only beer in my travels that lives up to EVERYTHING that was promised.
The pour is practically glowing neon orange.
Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy.
Scent and smell are hand in hand... pulpy citrus juices."	5
460	Julius	Lived up to the hype for me. Orange juice bomb, nice subtle sweetness, so smooth, beautifully balanced hop bitterness, immensely crushable. Not the best TH haze but could session this all day.	4.6
461	Julius	From a can dated 7/16/19. This is a classic, and standard-bearing NEIPA. Had not had opportunity to get to TH for some time but finally made the trip and rewarded. The beer pours a hazy orange/yellow. Tropical fruits, subtlely so, abound. The smoothess of it comes apparent right away. The balance of the carbonation, hoppiness, and juiciness is so well done. A favorite.	4.69
462	Julius	"Canned 7/24/19
Orange creamsicle murk mostly opaque. One finger of white head with full curtains and a full carbonation cap.
Blobs of fine bubbles
Spiky citrus scent, with pineapple, orange, grapefruit. Light yeast scent
Taste incorporates lemon, light malt, tropical fruits, orange.
Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, slight bitterness at the end. Stubborn consistent carbonation.
Delivers on its juice promises. No faults."	4.53
463	Julius	I'll start by saying I've never had tasty beer burps but, life offers unexpected twists sometimes. I might have to add a 5th category called Belch - I'll go 5. Finally made a trip to this brewery and while mayhem exists, it's well organized. The ale has everything you'd expect in a fine hazy NE IPA. A dense golden yellow pour with a small head that dissipates after a few minutes. The olfactory senses are blasted with delightful fruit from the tropics (mango, pineapple, papaya), a bit of citrus and a pleasant candy hint. Those notes are evermore evident in the palate while the citrus of the hops comes through along with some notes of stone fruit like nectarine. Feels absolutely lush on the mouth with a magnificent aftertaste. Splendid.	4.74
464	Julius	Great intro to the NEIPA style. Julius has soft notes of orange zest and mango, making it quite delectable. Possibly the softest mouthfeel of any of their rotational beers. My personal favorite of their rotationals and one of their most consistent beers.	4.44
465	Julius	I purchased a can of Julius directly from the brewery which was canned two days prior to the date of purchase according to the bottom of the can. The beer has a thick orange hue with a thin whitehead. It has a fruity scent of orange, mango and grapefruit. The beer has a very thick and smooth mouthfeel, velvety smooth. The taste was fruity and has similar flavors as the nose, I'm getting orange, mango and pineapple.	4.12
466	Julius	Let me start out by saying that many Treehouse beers taste sort of the same to me. I probably couldn't identify Haze from Super Typhoon from Julius or Julllius or Juuulius or Juliuuuuus or whatever bizzare iteration of vowels Treehouse slaps on the can. Julius was the first Treehouse I tried because its their flagship. I've had it from the can and on draft at the brewery. It's usually the beer I get for friends who ask to try Treehouse.. Julius is a pretty perfect name for this as orange juice is the first flavor profile you get. This is a very thick mouthfeel type of beer and sometimes it's hard not to think of chewing before you swallow it's so thick. It's a beautiful orange color ... it almost looks like you took a picture of a normal IPA and ran it through a highly saturated filter turning it orange. There is a slight head but not foamy.. The sweet orange juice with a little dank pineapple is present along with just a hint of bitterness ... overall it's kind of like an orange juice shandy with an IPA chaser in one sip..  1,541 characters	4.28
467	Julius	Finally got to try this beer - the one I was looking forward to the most from my recent acquisition of a trio of Tree House offerings. And I have to say, I was a little disappointed - probably because my expectations were sky-high. I was expecting something even better than Green (which was outstanding) and unfortunately this one didn't deliver. It was still an excellent NE-style IPA, just not head and shoulders better than Green or even Haze. Canning date was 5/17/19, so still quite fresh. Looks great, nice slightly darker orange color with a fair amount of haze and very nice fluffy white head with lots of lingering lacing, not quite making it into sheets or rings but very close. Smells amazing, lots of deep sweet fruity hop aromas as well as some weaker piney and floral hops. Malt in the background, and a good hit of dankness towards the end. Tastes similarly - the fruit that I could detect included pineapple, passion fruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit. So juicy and well-balanced, excellent tasting with good complexity and depth. Clearly enough to get a 4.25 rating from me, but didn't blow me away (to earn a 4.5) and didn't eclipse the Green or Haze flavors. Smooth, slightly sticky mouthfeel and just enough carbonation. Again, an excellent beer, certainly one of the better-tasting NE-style IPAs I've had, but just couldn't quite compare to the other Tree House beers I've tried.	4.34
468	Julius	It’s kind of unfair that I had king Julius before this but I still had to check this in.... Pours a hazy murky orange color. tropical citrus notes on the nose maybe some pineapple and mango.. it’s definitelt a juice bomb. Taste definitely follows the nose. Wish there was more of a hop presence in this but I guess that’s why I prefer the king Julius.. none the less proper.	4.21
469	Julius	Murky orange in body, fresh powder head. Citrus, papaya, mango, grass in the nose. Citrus, papaya, mango, grass, clean bitterness. Heavy body with medium carbonation.	4
470	Julius	Hazy opaque orange with one finger of creamy white foam that settles down to the thin cap. Aroma is a mix of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, peaches and cream. The flavor starts with a flash of hoppy bitterness upfront, along with the citrus and other fruit notes from the nose. Some creamy sweetness follows, then dries out, leaving some bitter earthy hops and a subtle malt flavor. The feel of each sip is wonderfully smooth and creamy. A delicious and smooth beer that lives up to its reputation.	4.4
471	Julius	A: Pours a hazy sunset orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing. S: Loads of citrus and tropical fruit up front along with some very light floral notes. Mango and passionfruit mostly, with some light pineapple in there as well. T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and tropical fruits. Again, lots of mango and passionfruit along with lighter pineapple and citrus. Low bitterness. Finishes with lingering fruitiness.  647 characters	4.64
472	Julius	"""The Can That Stepped into Yesterday"" 3/06/19
Nose is slightly muted to me, some orange pith and dank earthy hop. Flavor is straight orange gummy bears with a dank bitter finish. Mouthfeel is also very excellent, chewy with the exact right amount of carbonation. Overall the flavor is mind blowing, so smooth, balanced orange gummys with bitter pith and excellent carbonation to carry the flavor through."	4.71
473	Julius	Julius is the first beer that I had from Treehouse. I enjoyed a draft after waiting for cans. The beer was balanced and very satisfying. The color, aroma, feel and taste came together like a symphony. The price was also very fair and I look forward to my next trip to pick up more beers from Treehouse.	5
474	Julius	Thanks to BrutalFarce for this one in a ninja box. 16oz can (of course) poured into 14oz teku. Poured the expected murky yellow/orange/brown color of the style, with over 2 inches of fluffy, off-white head that had good retention and lacing. A lot of sediment settled to the bottom of the glass.. The aroma was the expected fruited hops of the style, with no real malt or grain showing. Same dealio on the tongue; fruity hops, no other attributes.. The body was what was expected: light, smooth, thin and had a medium finish. Drinkability was fine, if unexciting. Overall, it was what I expected; a template for the style. YMMV. Shrug.	2.99
475	Double Sunshine	Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a third of the top. The aroma is of of pine. I’m tasting a wallop of pine and a touch of grassy hops. The mouth is sticky and chewy.	4.28
476	Double Sunshine	16 oz. can from Brewery (also sampled at Brewery): this one pours a cloudy slightly orange tinted golden color. Minimal head and lacing. The nose is good. A mixture of many hops with none overpowering the other. Tropical, pine, citrus and some floral/herb notes. A little muted from what I expected. The taste is wonderful. A plethora of different hops, all well balanced against one another. Some dank hops, with tropical, pine, citrus and maybe a bit of some herb flavors. Now real sweetness to this, just a bit of a dank hop bite. A really excellent beer.	4.34
477	Double Sunshine	Pours a lightly hazy orange in color with a finger of tight white head. Aroma has grapefruit, orange, piney, and herbal notes. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma adding some tropical notes. Intensely hoppy yet super smooth. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very tasty and drinkable. I’d absolutely seek this out again.	4.64
478	Double Sunshine	DATE: September 26, 2019... OCCASION: drinking this in honor of a friend and beer companion who left our school for retirement to Vermont...thanks for introducing me to this and many other fine beers from and around the state... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours a picture-perfect orange amber body rife with effervescence... its head, a snowy peak of firm foam that settles into solar flares of ululance... how big can an aroma be? berry, lemon, mango, grapefruit, lush pine cone, pepper, garden herbs, dank basement, and a slight boozy conclusion... juicy draw, with a sip worth chewing... the teeth absorb what must be an 80+ IBU impact; its body couches arrogantly on the tongue; balanced and full in its finish, lasting if not resounding a half minute after its leaving... its presence evokes a bourbon, but its bite is more like a friendly embrace... BIG pine flavor, resin dripping and gum-splitting juiciness, with the citric shine blaring lemon, grapefruit, and other tropical rinds... this is brilliant, a beer that could be the companion for an entire evening, weighty but smooth, rewarding and flavorful... this is a perfect sendoff to Jeff, whose intellectual and pragmatic balance will be sorely missed in our neck of the woods..... thank you for sharing your gifts with us, and God bless, friend...	4.46
479	Double Sunshine	08/08/19 Canning Date, purchased at Lawson’s beautiful, newish tasting room, which is well worth a visit for its wood-bedecked beer hall, very friendly staff, excellent local food, sunny terrace with cornhole, and, of course, excellent beer. Visited on 8/18/19. Double Sunshine is simply the most pleasantly pungent smelling, hoppy, and juicy (yet not too sweet) tasting Vermont double IPA. While Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine is now more widely available and has a similar (if more muted) taste profile, this one spelunks the nasal passages and does a hop-laden tango on the tongue. In a side-by-side comparison with Heady Topper, this is the more beautifully complex (albeit slightly less sweet to the taste) winner.	5
480	Double Sunshine	I'm finally reviewing this excellent beer. I've had it a couple times over the years, but now it's out in cans, which is a great thing. A clear golden amber color with a thick white head that leaves considerable lace. Great aromas combining citrus, tropical notes and a little pine and herb. Taste is rich and hoppy with nothing off anywhere. Mouthfeel is just right...perfectly balancing a medium body and soft carbonation. Overall, a top notch IPA. I'm so glad it's now available in cans and not so hard to track down.	4.68
481	Double Sunshine	(16 oz can, canned on 05/20/19, purchased in cold 4-pack... poured into a fat tulip). L: crystal-clear, pale amber-gold liquid; tall stand of loose, frothy-spongy, off-white foam... foam collapses fast, but maintains chunky/rocky collar. S: pineapple (juice/syrup) all day, maybe some subtle background floral and pine/menthol(?) notes, maybe coconut (rum) too; faint essence of ethanol... great potency to start, settles into soft fragrance.  1,133 characters	4.41
482	Double Sunshine	Great beer. Sip’s older boozy brother with more pronounced citrus and dank hop character. Wish this could be in my steady rotation as my nightcap beer.	4.55
483	Double Sunshine	"16 oz can poured into a shaker.. Appearance
Clear blonde. Moderate carbonation. Short white head.. Nose
Grapefruit, orange, lemon, caramel, and honey..  450 characters"	4.08
484	Double Sunshine	Excellent DIPA. Had on tap at LFL brew pub. Went great with food too. Smooth juicey NEIPA that had some west coast dankness. Full hop fwd in nose and taste; but nicely combined with malts. Beautifully well balanced. Rich dark orange mahogany colored with full creamy head that seemed to last forever. Picture post card for a classic looking beer. Full creamy feel but still was not heavy or sticky. Oh so in my wheelhouse. As balanced a brew as I have ever had. So glad to have had it fresh on tap. One of better IPAs I’ve had.	4.54
485	Double Sunshine	2/12/19 canning date. A: Pours sort of an amberish-gold? Tall frothy light tan head. Excellent head retention and great lacing left on the glass.. S: Spicy pine is the primary hop aroma, but I get some grapefruit and tropical fruits in there as well. Mildly sweet too, sugary/caramel..  1,041 characters	4.53
486	Double Sunshine	Tasted from can. Pours slightly hazy amber orange with thick white rocky head. Aroma is tangerine and citrus notes. Taste is moderately to heavily bitter. Citrus flavors along with caramel, a little dankiness. Excellent ipa.	4.55
487	Double Sunshine	Dark amber color with an off-white head which dissipates quickly, leaving a nice lace. I am not an expert at discerning the smell, but I can detect sweet citrus, and some sweet breadiness. Taste follows the nose. After drinking Heady on a regular basis (I live in VT), it's a treat to drink a DIPA that doesn't slam me over the head with hops. This beer has a nice balance between hops and malts. Easy drinking, alcohol well-hidden. Just a refreshing, hoppy well balanced beer. Well worth the :45 minute drive to Waitsfield to grab this gem!	4.64
488	Double Sunshine	Lawson ups its Sip o' Sunshine ante. A mix of citrus and herbal flavors play off each other. Crack the can's flip-top, and abundant hop aroma goodness (almost) fills the room. Superior!	4.55
489	Double Sunshine	Poured into a 13 oz Alchemy Teku glass canned on 1/04/19. Pours a very attractive dark orange with a 1 finger plus sticky slightly off white head that leaves some thick rings of lace as it slowly settles. 5. Smell is big bold tangerine, some herbal dank marijuana, pine resin, and grapefruit rind. 4.5. Taste follows tangerine, a slight hint of marijuana, some sticky pine notes, pineapple, and some very nicely balanced grapefruit with very moderate bitterness. 4.75.  769 characters	4.71
490	Double Sunshine	Unfiltered looking and orange with a finger off white head that leaves ribbons of lacing behind. Smells like sweet caramel, orange, grapefruit and a big blast of pine. Tastes sweet up front with a ton of citrus and pine. The finish gets some caramel, orange and piney bitterness. Great beer.	4.6
491	Double Sunshine	"Pours a semi clear golden/orange color. 2 finger slightly off white, very foamy head with excellent retention. Really nice lacing as the head dissipates in the glass.
The nose is a really nice, deep, rich citrus and pine hop aroma. I get pine and grapefruit. I also just get the faintest orange aroma in it.
Taste - Slightly mellow for a second, almost sweet. The hops then kick in, and don't let go. I Get the grapefruit, and orange up front. That transforms into a sticky pine on the rear that just doesn't let go.
Starts out creamy feeling, then it becomes a sticky hop party. The pine hops really stick in my throat, and just don't let go. You'd probably need some goo gone to get rid of the sticky hop feel.
This is an amazing IPA, and I can see why there's so much love for it on the boards. Very well made."	4.53
492	Double Sunshine	poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a semi clear light amber with a finger of frothy white head. smells of pine, woods, a little hint of tropical fruit but it’s more piney and west coast than new england. taste is similar. pine, sharp bitterness from the hops but still quite drinkable. a tinge of caramel flavor. mouthfeel is spectacularly full and creamy making this DIPA all too drinkable. really takes this beer over the top for me. excellent old school DIPA. my favorite of the sunshines.	4.59
493	Double Sunshine	Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Not as complex as Sip of Sunshine, but still quite good. Here goes:. A: Slightly hazy orange. Beer pours a moderate head that leaves very little lacing. Nothing spectacular. On the other hand, the color is quite exquisite. S: Very piney. I detect lots of grapefruit and pine, some orange peel as well; not detecting the complexity of Sip of Sunshine, however. Still great, though..  647 characters	4.28
494	Double Sunshine	Double Sunshine pours a nearly clear golden honey color with an inviting and thick, off white rocky head with some sticky lacing. The smell is packed full of citrus and tropical fruits; orange, guava, papaya with some notable floral characteristics, a nutty malt and an earthy and piney hop resin. The taste...phenomenal! Soft on the palette with an array of flavors from the juicy fruits, but also a mellow sweetness before the resinous pine. Well balanced finished very clean.	4.68
495	Double Sunshine	"Golden honey color only slightly hazy. Pure white foam, cover recedes to a thin cover later. Lace for days.. Canned on: 12/18/18.
Opened on: 12/19/18.....FRESH.. Light and sweet , tropical red fruity aromatics kick it off. Green grassy fields of wet July summer, grains of barley, wheat and spelt come forth from the husky portion of hops and malt..  665 characters"	4.29
496	Double Sunshine	"Serving: Can
Canned: Nov-10-2018. 
A:
Pours a clear, flowing orange with a fat white head that drops to a little cap. All right retention; little lacing. (4). S:
Mango and orange rind, floral spice, sap, bready malt. (4.25).  929 characters"	4.41
497	Double Sunshine	Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Kappy's in Norwell for about seventeen dollars. Have had SOS and Super Sesh. This is one of the best beers that I have ever had. Reminds me of my first taste of SOS, which, unfortunately, is way too inconsistent these days.	4.75
498	Double Sunshine	Pours orange with a clarity that is nearly translucent with the first 12oz of the beer poured into the glass. It turns to a starburst opaque translucence when the final ounces are poured into the glass. Head is a finger and a half of white foam. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and light guava. Tropical citrus notes are heavy and out front, with biscuity, earthy, nutty malts and herbal hops adding a big backdrop. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, and guava with notable herbal, floral hops and biscuity, earthy, nutty malts. Despite the naming of 'Northeast IPA', the hops are much stickier and less sweet than others of the style. Malts still serve as a backdrop, but not an after thought. It carries a quality balance between hops and malts, while leaning lightly towards the sweet side. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a crisp texture that touches on effervescent. Overall, very flavorful and surprisingly balanced. Reviewed per the New England IPA style due to its style listing on its profile at the time of review.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can. Can 10/11, reviewed 12/2. Reviewed per NE IPA style guidelines.	4.23
499	Double Sunshine	Wow! This is phenomenal! Hazy and darker than a typical NEIPA. More bitter too, but that’s my favorite part. Soft mouthfeel as well. Don’t pass this up. I need to find more.	4.79
500	Zenne Y Frontera	Drank season 17/18 blend no. 49. This is by far one of the best lambics on the market. Well balanced, flavorful beer. Our bottle had some carbonation and and great complexity.	5
501	Zenne Y Frontera	Decanted at 3F. Perhaps the perfect all-around lambic drinking experience. Visually stunning- amazing bouquet. Taste was incredibly well balanced. Blends 3, 5 and 6 were all great, but 3 was my favorite.	5
502	Zenne Y Frontera	Batch 2 so this was the solera. Little bit darker orange, great head. Great aroma of lambic and bright citrus along with some barrel. I could not pick out the sherry but could tell this was a different type of barrel then your standard lambic foeder/barrel that just has wood character. To be honest it really reminded me of Boon Vat 109 which is a great compliment to both beers. This was great, thankful to have a set of the new releases.	4.5
503	Zenne Y Frontera	The beer pours a clear orange with no head. It smells and tastes of tart lemon, rustic funk, Sherry, and light cheese. Funky, but well put together and very easy drinking.	4.99
504	Zenne Y Frontera	"I've tasted several thousand different beers over the years. 10,000 plus check ins and at least that amount of different beers on a couple of other ""check in"" sites. Bottom Line: This is my favorite beer.....ever, to date. I can't say it's the best made or even the best beer I've had - it's simply my favorite. Amazing flavors, mouthfeel and finish. It has it all with great complexities and yet goes down easy and you want more. Good by itself or amazing with just about any food profile."	4.93
505	Zenne Y Frontera	The nose of this showcases the sherry aged gueuze and the familiar drie funk. On the palate more of the same that funky cheesey gueuze goodness, grassy notes and tons of dark fruit and residual sugar from the sherry to finsh.	4.81
506	Zenne Y Frontera	Sorry Contillon and Bokkenrijder, this is the best lambic I have had! Worth the hunt, worth the money, worth every single minute you give it. Wow! It is almost hard to put into words how much is going on, yet so much on a delicate scale. Plenty of sweeter red wine elements, grapes, sherry booze, lemon, plus other fruits like orange, peach and pear. Then there is the hay, earthy, and beet sugar base that crops up in fun and balanced sips. Plenty of funk, barrel elements and oak to boot. Little bit of everything, amazing!	4.75
507	Zenne Y Frontera	A 750ml bottle, batch 2, bottled on 26th March 2016 and a best before date of 26th October 2026. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen funnel and decanter, decanted for 60 to 90 minutes and poured into a 3 Fonteinen Zenne glass.. Appearance: A mostly clear golden orange colour with a minimal white head and sparse to no lacing.. Aroma: Earthy funk, barnyard, hay, oak, nutty, sherry, peach and lemon..  740 characters	4.8
508	Zenne Y Frontera	Zenne batch 2 poured into a Torst glass. Golden orange in color. Not much of a head. Aromas of oak and sherry release from the glass. Picking a little citrus as well. Upon first sip, I’m speechless. So complex yet perfectly balanced. Oak, sherry and subtle nuances of funk and citrus. This is so easy to drink. Perfectly carbed and each sip is a treat. This is the best lambic I’ve ever tasted hands down. Amazing brew!	4.93
509	Zenne Y Frontera	"Batch 2 - Solera
Poured with a Cantillon basket. One hard to describe beer but how interesting to finally try it, I'll do my best.. Slightly veiled, orange, small ring around the glass..  444 characters"	4.72
510	Zenne Y Frontera	Batch 1. 2015 vintage; drank 11/18/17 @ the Yarchives.. Cloudy orange appearance.. Minimal white head; minimal lace..  269 characters	4.25
511	Zenne Y Frontera	batch 1, bottled 1/3/2014, decanted and served in a white wine glass. Look - decanted was a ruby red, white head and once poured into a glass it lightened up to a pink grapefruit color, slight white head that disappeared quickly, nice lacing for a 7% lambic. Smell - barnyard hay, sherry, and heavy oak and can smell the acid. Some complexity to it and a little fruity, but overall fairly mild nose.  1,018 characters	4.83
512	Zenne Y Frontera	2014 vintage, poured into a decanter, at the Lambik-o-droom.. Semi-hazy amber pour with a thin, velvety off-white head.. Easily identifiable 3 Fonteinen lambic funk, green apples, mineral notes, light fruit oxidation, a bit of grapefruit, sherry (or I should say Oloroso), very light caramel, oak, light vanilla. Very interesting to have side-by-side with Oloroso and PX. Compared to batch 2 - Solera, this one is drier, much more funk-forward and a bit more oaky, as well. Very similar to the Armand & Gaston..  1,179 characters	4.9
513	Zenne Y Frontera	This is stellar lambic and one of the best new beer releases in recent years. The sherry barrels work magic. There's nothing to knock here save availability.	4.93
514	Zenne Y Frontera	Served at lambic o Droom . Decanted and enjoyed over an hour. Paired with two sherries that were in the barrels it was aged in.. Pours a darker amber slightly hazy body with a sudsy white head that leaves spotty lacing as it reduces slowly.. Aromas are delightful - lots of wood, oak and sherry. The sherry is big and inviting after decanting. This smells like no lambic I've ever smelled.. sharp cheese and sherry oak dominate with the usual 3F tart acidity, citrus, and white wine in the background..  867 characters	4.66
515	Zenne Y Frontera	"Pours hazy amber with small white head.
Aroma has so much funk, hay, barnyard, dry cellar, lemon tart.
Taste is lemon tart, hay, grass, not as much funk as the aroma, hops, sherry sweetness, extremely very well balanced. Best lambic I've ever had."	5
516	Zenne Y Frontera	Decanted bottle, poured into a taster. Pours a beautiful deep orange with a huge funky aroma. Super complex nutty notes without much carb, although it was not overly missed. Spectacular.	4.94
517	Zenne Y Frontera	Pours a dull, burnished gold with a tight white band around the shoulders. Nose expresses must, a hint of oak and a trace of spirits. Taste consistent with nose. Mouthfeel is light, soft on the palate and almost still with a mild acidity. Overall, quite good; however a little carbonation would bring out the flavors and complexity in my opinion.	4.13
518	Zenne Y Frontera	Amazing stuff. Had a couple pours at the Shelton Festival. A deep orange color. The nose is funk and sherry, and the taste is minerals, basement, wine and an uplifting note of fruit. Amazing stuff but some equally great beers that don't involve giving up a kidney.	4.74
519	Zenne Y Frontera	The best gueuze I ever had!! Great taste evolution in this one.. funky notes and great with the sherry hints. When you air this bottle it turns into a real gem.	5
520	Zenne Y Frontera	Amazing beer! The nose and taste had an exquisite balance of different cherry flavors. One of if not the best lambic I have ever had. Worth trying!	5
521	Zenne Y Frontera	Can't help but compare it to Cantillon's Saint Lamvinus. And while I can respect the approach to a beer like this (and St. Lam), I personally don't enjoy wine all that much, which is probably why my rating suffers in comparison to most other's. Still, it's a fine beer/wine hybrid that I could enjoy in moderation.	4.14
522	Zenne Y Frontera	Batch 2 Solera, decanted for 30 minutes. Almost clear golden color with a few big bubbles. Aroma has lambic funk, unripe fruits, vinous notes, wood barrel spiciness and dried dates. Taste starts sour, lemony and astringent with some stonefruit pit bitterness. Finish has a light cognac complexity but everything is really well integrated. Medium body with low carbonation but it's not flat by any means. I enjoyed this one more than the first batch.. Batch 1 sample. Hazy dark orange color, white head. Aroma is really elegant with fine cognac, sherry and dried fruits like raisins and figs. Taste starts sour with specific lambic funk, continues with lots of wood and barrel character. Finishes really dry and lingers with a light cognac flavor. Light body with lower carbonation. Really great aroma but the taste could be more complex. 4.5/4.75/4.25/4.5/4.5 - 4.46	4.6
523	Zenne Y Frontera	cloudy punish orange with a white head. Aromas of some funk, some rubber, some cherry, vinegar, blood orange. Taste is sour with some minerality to it. The taste was much better than the aroma. Once you get used to the rubber smell, this beer is really great.	4.7
524	Zenne Y Frontera	Unquestionably one of the great lambics I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Beautiful rich wooden hue is accompanied by a sweet and deep sherry barrel aroma. Flavor is deep mineral water followed by tobacco, leather, and a lingering finish of orange marmalade. Not too sweet or too dry. Crisp on the tongue but retains the classic 3F carbonation. Lighter than some of the seasons, but heavier than other 3F gueuze offerings. A truly spectacular beer and a pleasure to drink. Not sure when I'll next get a chance to taste one of these.	4.85
525	Abner	"12 oz draft pour at Churchkey in DC. Hops: Centennial, Chinook, Columbus, Simcoe, Warrior. Well here it is. A legend of Vermont craft beer. A relic. I love Edward, and this seems to be the double IPA version of that beer. I consider it part of the first wave of NE style IPAs, along with Double Sunshine and Heady Topper. Hugely influential. A little darker than most made these days and look at those old school ""C"" hops! This would have blown my mind in 2012, but now it's merely a great beer of many around these days. I prefer HF's newer offerings, to be perfectly honest. But I'm a lucky son of a bitch to have tried this."	4.31
526	Abner	Opaquely hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy, lumpy white head that displays good retention and clings in ridges.. The medium full body has a firm carbonation that brings a not unwelcome but decidedly stronger than usual bitterness of citrus rinds, also accompanied by some mild booze. In a way it's still well balanced, particularly by some herbal dankness and a little white pepper, but still, this is the most syrupy, woody and resiny IPA I've had by Hill. Just before the semi-dry finish, some mango, Cuties and pear characteristics surface.. It's solid, to be sure, but not even close to my favorite Hill IPA. That this is the highest Hill beer on the Top 250 is beyond me.	4.18
527	Abner	Poured into a pint glass from a growler filled the same day (Aug 10). Opaque and deep. Medium-bodied for an NEIPA and pungent in a piney/musky sort of way. Tasted like the apotheosis of the style. This is special.	5
528	Abner	"Excited to try this. Expectations high given its reputation. On tap at BeerShop, NYC.
Pours a hazy orange color with a thumbnail length frothy head. It is juicy looking and inviting.
A medley of tropical, citrus and stone fruit opens the aroma. In addition, there is a touch of dank and herbal aromas evoking resin, floral sweetness and a touch of onion. The malt aroma is bready with a hint of honey and caramel sweetness.
Juicy flavors all the way redolent of all kinds of fruit. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit rind, orange peel, tangerine, peach pit, and mango. There is a developing bitterness that adds balance, along with herbal and spicy hops flavors. Notes of floral hops, pine, grass, onion. There is a mild and clean alcohol spice at times. The malt profile, although mostly secondary to the hops dominance, nevertheless has notes of biscuit and honey.
Medium bodied, moderately crisp and a carbonation that is on par. A dry and resiny finish yields a lingering bitterness.
It was a delicious pleasure drinking this one. It was like a hops explosion in the mouth that represented a bouquet of complex flavors. One of the best."	4.75
529	Abner	Drinking this in a dark bar so hard to get a good read on the appearance. Faint (very faint) notes of grass/earth and citrus rind on the nose, would expect more aromas from a HF IPA. Taste is somewhat muted, a little grapefruit bitterness, a little pine and not much else. Not as juicy or expressive as society and solitude offerings. Feel is effervescent and light, good carb, doesn’t coat the mouth despite its abv.  497 characters	4.19
530	Abner	L: Beautiful deep cloudy orange with 1 inch of frothy white head. Poured into a tulip glass from a growler, filled @HF the day before.. S: Tropical fruit, but very ripe tropical fruit. I smell guava and passionfruit and mango in there. Very crisp aroma.. T: A very hoppy and hazy DIPA. Mouth-wateringly good. Lots of the same flavor notes in the aroma translate to the taste - mango, ripe navel orange. Towards the end, a bit of a citrus rind and some pine. Just fantastic though - really well balanced and just so clean for a beer of 8%.  1,109 characters	4.96
531	Abner	Growler fill dated February 2019 - very fresh. Beer doesn't appear to have settled at all - no floaties, no hop residue, no yeast. Lightly hazy in appearance, a bit gold around the edges, beautiful orange otherwise. Smells terrific - hoppy and citrusy.. Taste notes include a bit of melon and lots of citrus. It's a very full taste experience that hits all over your tongue. Consistency isn't quite so thick as I'd expected, but it's certainly not thin.. Finish is ever so slightly dry and very clean. It's a terrific, refreshing drinking experience - I'd love to drink this beer all of the time. The ABV isn't very easy to discern - this could get quite dangerous..  723 characters	4.56
532	Abner	Abner is perfectly balanced and not a pure juice bomb. The nose is pineapple and pine. The taste is less citrus and maybe more pine. The finish is clean but not crisp, a bit of a sweetness. Overall an exceptional NEIPA.	5
533	Abner	"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro.. L -- Lovely opaque orange body with a scant half finger of white head. Fairly quickly dissipating, but a sudsy layer remains
S -- Very pungent, raw citrus. Orange flesh, yellow grapefruit, tangerine, Clementine. Minimal tropical character, which is kinda nice given recent NEIPA trends. Also getting a good amount of pale malt, which gives the citrus aromas a sherbert-like character
T -- All the citrus character carries over from the aromas, but is a little more zesty and pithy. Also getting some lemon zest, creamy maltiness, and pine
F -- Wonderfully soft and fluffy, especially given the ABV. Lingering oily hop bite reminds you this is an intensely hopped DIPA
O -- An artful, masterfully crafted DIPA with understandable hype. Almost 10 years after release and this still stands amongst the best. Incredible what they can coax out of the old-school hop lineup they use. 91/100.  1,286 characters"	4.49
534	Abner	02/2014 - Huge grapefruit, some caramel, orange rind on the nose; great bitterness, floral, strong punch of pine, orange rind, and grapefruit; superb body that blows many stouts out of the water; the finish is dry, bitter, yet flavorful and balanced!	4.74
535	Abner	After a hard day working, this is an amazing treat! Everyone knows how good this stuff is, and I’m equally impressed as everyone! One of HF’s best!	4.67
536	Abner	"This beer is absolutely amazing. So refined compared to a lot of dipas.
Very complex with a great citrus theme with a lot of tropical undertones and a great malt and yeasty backbone"	4.74
537	Abner	"Had on tap and brought two 750ml growlers home.
A: pours a hazy golden wheat color, carbonation, nice subtle stringy lacing, frothy + 1 finger brilliant white fine bubbly foam head
S: sweet tropical fruit, mango, papaya, citrus, tangerine, malt, fresh grass
M: medium body, smooth on the tongue, juicy, creamy
T: soft and pillowy, tropical fruits, citrus, mango, guava, passionfruit, slight earthy pine resin, hops are present but subtle, very minor bitterness, mineral notes in the finish, I'm going to guess the water is hard (alkaline)
O: solid DIPA, creamy, amazing how the hop fruit flavors are very present yet very minor bitterness,"	4.64
538	Abner	It's been awhile since I've had this one but I remember a hazy and enjoyable IPA from the NE. I don't think it was as fresh as I would have liked it but I was in Texas and can't complain.	4.33
539	Abner	"Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew, again.. 750 ml Growler
BB: Feb 21 2018. Poured into a Tree House glass a very nice cloudy pale yellow/orange color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger plus creamy white head, which leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is very nice, hoppy, malty, with a very nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, grapefruit, mango, peach, apricot), nice diesel like. The taste is very nice, hoppy, malty, with a very nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, grapefruit, mango, peach, apricot), nice diesel like. Medium Body, ABV hidden very well, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, a very tasty brew. Glad to have gotten a chance to try it. Addictive! Orange Julius! Thanks Kyle!"	4.85
540	Abner	I had this one a few months ago on a month old growler and wasn't impressed. Decided to just rate now having it fresh. Same balance I get, nothing too tropical, not too citrusy, slight bitter finish. Loved it.	4.79
541	Abner	Finally got a chance to try this beer. I've had lots of other HF IPA's, but this one has escaped me, until now.. Pours an almost orange, tangerine color with a fairly small white head. Looks great. Aroma is more subdued than expected. I get mostly pine and grassiness. I was expecting more citrus, but I don't get much at all.. Taste follows the nose. Mostly pine and an earthy flavor. Not overwhelming flavor, but solid. Mouthfeel is great as always from HF. I would say the bitterness is higher than expected and I think it's masking the overall flavor..  677 characters	4.14
542	Abner	Very cloudy with a brownish gold color. It looks like apricot juice except for the head, which is solid and lasting. Extensive spots and a few streaks for lace.. Strong grapefruit rind nose. Lots of sweet citrus fruit.. The flavor is not sweet like the smell led me to believe. The pale malt is predictable. The grapefruit is stronger and truer to the real thing than any other beer I've had. The body is just thicker than typical while the carbonation is low. The finish is mildly bitter but it lasts long after the swallow.	4.39
543	Abner	Poured from growler and consumed alongside barbecue salmon dinner. Cloudy pale orange color with a soft and frosty head that leaves a coating on the glass. Hoppy aromas including tropical and resin. Taste is delicious as expected with long lasting hops and a fair bit of bitterness on the finish. Mouth is just about right. Overall, a classic NE IPA.	4.33
544	Abner	Poured from a 32oz growler into a tulip glass, one week after purchase. Appearance is hazy orange/brown and opaque with 2 finger thick head. Smell is a nice mixture of earthy hops and citrus (orange) with notes of honeysuckle, a touch of burnt sugar, and hay. I'm not surprised it is made with American hops.. Taste follows the nose with more citrus flavor coming through. Bitterness and sweetness are moderate too low. Mouthfeel is incredible: full in body and smooth yet drinkable (fairly low carbonation).. Overall, this is another amazing offering from Hill Farmstead that tastes like an Imperial, hoppier, and juicier version of Edward. There is a ton of flavor and body, but the balance is still on point. As expected, this is one of the best IPAs and worth seeking out.	4.94
545	Abner	"Look: golden orangish yellow with an inch creamy head
Smell: orange, pinneaple, grapefruit with hits of lemon zest and pine
Taste: hops bomb, orange and grapefruit are the most present fallowed by some grasses and a hint of pine.
Feel: semi dry, creamy mouth feel, medium body and carbonation
Overall: absolutely amazing beer, true hop bomb"	4.68
546	Abner	750ml swing top growler filled on 8/30 best by Sept 6th poured into a shaker pint.. A: Not much of a head just a small soapy wisp. Body is a murky tan and orange.. S: Lots of zest pineapple, grapefruit, light lemon and grass..  563 characters	4.45
547	Abner	"A - Pours a very hazy orange with a white head and lots of lacing
S - Aroma is not strong, perhaps some melon.
T - Flavor is apricot or melon, soft, no bitterness. Awesome.
M - Average mouth feel and carbonation.
O - Wow, an excellent beer, well balanced very drinkable"	4.67
548	Abner	Light amber/bark straw very cloudy appearance with significant white head that disipates slowly. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus with a tough of hops. Taste is also a mild citrus that is very pleasant.	4.56
549	Abner	Growler from Hill Farm, brought back to home, drank the next day.. It pours a yellow hazy liquid with a white head.. Nose is exotic fruits like pineapple, mango, citrus. Juicy mouthfeel, crisp, one of the great Double IPA out there for sure..  356 characters	4.32
550	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"I tend to rebel against the hard to get beers, but this is worth it. I wouldn't wait in line for it or pay up for it (or anything else in life), but if fate puts a bottle in front of you- buy it! Carve out a special night/afternoon when all is right and enjoy.
I love the variance every year."	4.59
551	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"Look: Motor Oil color, without the thick syrup-like consistency of some stouts. Yes, motor oil is a good thing.
Smell: Rocket Fuel.
Taste: A perfect balance of strong flavors.
Feel: Great from start to finish.
Overall: My favorite beer."	5
552	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"Bottle date 15OCT14
Dark black pour with brown thin head which dissipates quickly.
Nose is intense with sweet dark fruit, bittersweet dark chocolate and bourbon.
Mouth is thick and rich again with sweet dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate and bourbon.
13% + AVB is well hidden.
This is an exceptional brew that can you can spend alot of time rolling your nose and tongue over."	4.75
553	Bourbon County Brand Stout	First off let me say that I'm not a stout guy normally. It's too syrupy and one gives me a buzz and two gives me a headache usually. However, I am sucker for chocolate so I find myself drinking stouts on occasion. My favorite is Founders' KBS which adds a little liccorice/Basil taste into theirs. I also like Belching Beaver Chocolate Peanut Butter stout.. At $12 per bottle (and the bottle looks bigger than the content is) for a little over a pint, this stuff better be great. It is the OG chocolate stout having been one of the first premium 'wait in line' seasonally released beers. This is before Budweiser bought them out which drove a stake into the heart of craft beer lovers everywhere. Thankfully the process of making this seems not to have been too corporatized although they do crank out quite a few more bottles these days making it less hard to find.. Each year varies and each year has 2-4 editions. Mine is the 2018 standard edition. I understand 2018 was a good year for this. It has a bitter chocolate taste with a little creaminess. The bourbon barrel comes through with a molasses taste followed by a bit of medicinal alchohol notes. It's smoother than some bourbon barrel aged stouts but lacks a bit of that licorice punch of KBS. I think those who prefer a sweeter creamier stout will like this. The cheaper stouts almost have a salty soy sauce aftertaste to them but not this..  2,307 characters	4.5
554	Bourbon County Brand Stout	I went out and got this one after trying the coffee version. That was damn good. This is too, but to be honest I can't articulate precisely the difference. Lack of coffee, I would say. Read the other reviews. The ABV is high and this is bottle two so definitely I'll defer to the opinions of the wise folks below	4.5
555	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Pours black with nary a head, fine carbonation visible. Nose of malty bourbon. Flavor follows suit, very sweet followed by a wave of bourbon goodness. Hops are not really noticeable. Definitely a sipping beer and it gets better as it warms up. Drinking the 2018 version, booze is definitely noticeable but surprisingly not that hot. A good stout albeit rather expensive.. Personally, I prefer Founder's Backwoods Bastard over this,this is just too sweet for my taste.	3.85
556	Bourbon County Brand Stout	One of the best of the planet's dark beverages! Thick (used to be thicker). Incredible. My favorite was 2014, followed by 2015, then 2017. Seems they have off years and some inconsistency. Also the occasional quality control problem that they have done better than most to make up for.. Molasses, bourbon, smoke, leather - all the good stuff concentrated.	4.66
557	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Appearance: Thick, opaque black, coffee color at edges, dark tan creamy head, quickly dissipates.. Smell: Alcohol kick, bourbon over roasted malt, coffee, oak hints, raisin.. Taste: Bourbon, sweet dark roasted malt rich flavor with a hint of raisin. Just a touch of hop in the finish..  379 characters	4.73
558	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"Pours a rich, dark coffee brown with a light head
Smell - sweet, molasses, brandy, bourbon, caramel, toffee, burnt sugar, slightly smokey,
Taste - same flavors as smell only much stronger and richer with the additions of raisin and dried fruit. Alcohol is noticeable and flavor lingers on the palate a long time.
Mouthfeel - full-bodied, “syrupy,”. This is a magnificent stout.. I drank it slightly cooler than room temp. This is one to sip slowly and enjoy the flavors like you would a fine brandy.. Definitely worth a try and one to age before drinking."	4.99
559	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"16.9oz bottle. Bottling date is '24OCT16'. 13.8% ABV.
Black colored body, with no back lit highlights. Brief tan head, leaves behind a bubble fed ring and a swirling bubble fed surface. No lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, with oak bourbon barrels and some dark fruit, along with slight vanilla, caramel, and smoke.
Taste of dark roasted malts and dark cherry and raisin, along with bourbon oak barrel and its vanilla, also caramel and dark char. Burbs of dark chocolate.
Medium plus mouth feel, heavy texture with the alcohol. Lesser carbonation feel.
This is a high ABV% stout with appropriate flavors.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
16.9oz bottle. Bottling date is '15SEP17'. 14.1% ABV.
Black colored body, with no back lit highlights. Brief fizzy (noisy) tan head disappears, leaving no head and no ring. No lacing.
Aroma of bourbon oak barrel, dark roasted malts, caramel, and thin vanilla.
Taste of dark roasted malts soaked in bourbon oak barrels, with caramel, vanilla, and slight smoke.
Medium plus mouth feel, very smooth texture. Seems like absent carbonation.
Correctly tasting imperial stout that conducts itself as a smooth drinking experience.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
16.9oz bottle. Bottling date is '07SEP18'. 15.2% ABV.
Black colored body. Brief tan colored head settles back to some swirling small islands and an active thin ring. Leaves behind a few tiny spots of lacing, but most slide back down into body.
Aroma of oak bourbon barrel, with rich caramel and vanilla. Dark roasted malts.
Taste of purple grapes soaked in the bourbon oak barrel. Big vanilla and caramel components, with a supporting smokiness. Rich dark roasted malts.
Mouth feel is heavy and thick, with a coating of the mouth texture. Better carbonation.
This is a real treat of high ABV%, toffee/caramel, oak barrel with vanilla, and a base of dark roasted malts.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In trying the vintages of 2016, 2017, and 2018, the 2018 is most rewarding in smell density, taste profile, and mouth feel. The 2016 vintage presented as thinner and with dark fruit expressions. The 2017 vintage lacked the warmness and smoothness of the 2018 vintage. Based on my limited review, I say that aging BCBS is not necessary and will likely lessen the drinking pleasure experience.
Rating is based on the 2018 vintage."	4.64
560	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Review #600. Delicious imperial stout that really lives up to its hype - although I gave it almost straight 4.5s all the way through, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't going to reach the 4.6-4.7 range beer that I was expecting, especially given that this was a 2016 vintage that I'd specifically aged a few more months just to wait as long as I could. Looks great, nice deep dark rich black color with a little tan lingering head and just a hint of some spotty lingering lacing. Would have given it more points if it had nicer-looking lacing, but I gave an extra 0.25 for the richness of the color and of the tan head. Smells great, lots of dark mocha fudge, vanilla, medium roast coffee, roasted nuttiness, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, fig, oak, bourbon and some toffee. Aromas blended well together and the smell was just heavenly. Taste follows the nose, and again that rich chewy fudge, vanilla, oak and bourbon is just so well-balanced. There was a little alcohol upfront as the beer warmed, but not aggressively so, and the very high ABV always felt deceivingly well-hidden. Smooth, rich, chewy, thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just enough carbonation to match the depth of this stout. I really enjoyed it, wish I had more bottles to sample and savor at a later date, and couldn't recommend this beer more highly. It paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert. Delicious!	4.51
561	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"This is the most delicious stout I have ever had. The most delicious alcoholic beverage I have ever had. I tried a Founders Breakfast Stout the other day and thought it couldn't get any better, but this one edges it out. It's almost hard to call this a stout as it tastes somewhere in between a stout and a wine. Sweet and heavy with vanilla and chocolate. Almost entirely black but with a slight amber glow. If you have the chance to try one of these you can't pass it up.
2018 bottle"	5
562	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Presentation: 2018 release bottled on 08/22/2018. 16.9 oz. brown bottle with the bottling date printed on the label. Served in a snifter.. Appearance: The thin, quarter finger head goes away very quickly. It's a thick, pure black and leaves a small amount of patchy lacing.. Smell: It's a sweet and dark scent. There's dried fruit, ripe plums, grapes, vanilla, oak, brown sugar and smokey, roasted malts..  1,000 characters	4.37
563	Bourbon County Brand Stout	2017 bottle. Still one of the best Imperial Stouts. Lots of chocolate flavor with some coffee, a bit bozzy (as it should be at over 14%). Every BA should have it as least once.	4.3
564	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"After a blind test, Bourbon County 2017 I was ranked third after Firestone Parabola (2018) and Founders' KBS (2016).
It is more similar to Parabola than KBS."	4
565	Bourbon County Brand Stout	22 oz bottle, 2018. Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of chocolate malt, toast, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla and spices. Body is full, creamy and smooth. Taste is of bourbon, nutty, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit, vanilla and spices. Finish is long, massive and spicy. Delicious brew.	4.94
566	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"My first taste of this legend. 2018 version. poured at cellar temp. Pours a really beautiful rich ebony brown. Very active cocoa colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. Lots of visible carbonation.
Smell is boozy and figgy. chocolate. dark fruit. some light roastiness. coherent and pleasant.
Taste is rich and smooth up front with just a touch of boozy heat on the back end. Bitter chocolate is much more prominent than in the nose, dark fruit much less present. Chocolate is in fact quite dominant. There seems to be a bit of detectable barrel (although it's faint enough for me that I can imagine it is psychosomatic) and with a bit of wine-snob aeration in the mouth the bourbon is easily detectable.
Mouthfeel is amazing. Truly lovely body that is certainly dominant on the palate but doesn't seem to build up too much.
Overall I am genuinely impressed. This is one that you hear so much about that it is hard to go into it without preconceptions. To me though, this is an excellent stout, and at $12 for a pint+ bottle it's actually kind of a good deal. Rich and chocolatey (without chocolate added), complex and yet coherent. This is certainly a deserving superstar. Well done GI"	4.45
567	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Finally cracked open this treat that I bought for myself over Christmas. Poured a dark chocolate with a one finger mocha frothy head that dissipated quickly to nothing. Aroma is faint molasses, chocolate, malt and bourbon. The aroma becomes more pungent as the brew warms. Taste is sweet malt, bourbon and caramel forward with hints of rich dark chocolate and dark fruit in the middle with black licorice, bourbon and burnt toast on the finish, which lingers. This is a real sipper . . . a thick boozy stout that makes your rear molars float. ;) OMG . . . I'm in love with a sexy woman with rich tastes that I cannot afford! Yet . . . I just have to have her . . . :)	4.66
568	Bourbon County Brand Stout	I love a good stout such as Guinness Extra Stout or Young's Double Chocolate Stout, but this is overrated garbage. It has an overly sweet and syrupy taste that makes me gag at first sip. Imagine someone poured whiskey in your Guiness then added several sugar substitute(Sweet n Low) packets a splash of milk and then let it stew in a sweaty dorm room for a few days. Foul and one of the worst beers I've ever tried. Bought a 12 pack and gave away 9. Tried 3 times to be a convert, but am convinced people are afraid to say it's gross and not be considered a connoisseur.	1.29
569	Bourbon County Brand Stout	2018 vintage, bottled 4.5 months ago.. Pours near-black with minimal tan head.. The nose and taste are deep chocolate, caramel, bourbon, wood, and faint cherry. Amazing..  282 characters	4.65
570	Bourbon County Brand Stout	"I tried this beer for the first time tonight and all I have to say is WOW! I am a fan of Dragons Milk. This one is smoother, cleaner and just plain nice. The ABV is a little on the high side to drink more than one a night and that it is a seasonal those are its only down sides.
It has(had :)) a nice bourbon smell, with the normal hints of vanilla. It has a nice buttery back taste(might be what they say is caramel(I make my own caramel and it does not taste like butter.) with a nice soft smoke taste.. IT is my new seasonal favorite."	4.65
571	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Dark as night. Tasty as hell. First one was boozy at the 15% mark, but after pacing myself on the next one a week or so later, I was impressed with the rich flavors and smooth finish. Great beer. I’d say take your time and enjoy one.	4.55
572	Bourbon County Brand Stout	2016 Vintage reviewed Jan 20, 2019 (2017 and 2018 Vintages Below). Pour: Black with a little brown tonge or maybe that’s the deep tan head. Minimal head that quickly dissipated into a thin ring. Slight bubble lacing while drinking. A bit underwhelming. (Same as 2018). Nose: sweet malts, just a hint of bourbon up front. Lots of Dark brandied fruit. Really nice but more subtle than the 2018 from Nov..  3,272 characters	4.67
573	Bourbon County Brand Stout	Hands down, the best Bourbon beer you can find. I love this beer so much. Aging them is so much better. Each sip is just amazing. Well respected brew.	5
574	Bourbon County Brand Stout	2018 edition. Look: Pitch black. Barely a finger of dark tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring; even changing how I pour it doesn't get more head.. Smell: Very sweet. Chocolate, coffee, milk, and some roast malt..  601 characters	3.79
575	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Lucky enough to find a bottle at Monterrey Bar in Berlin, which had another wonderful cellar. Affordable, met the hype, sweet, earthy, alcohol well hidden. The monks have their art down to a science at this point	4.75
576	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Consistent. Unique. Incomparable. You can shamelessly wax lyrical about Westvleteren. So, I will. My sin of cheesy cliche won't be absolved. To try any Westvleteren is a rite of passage. I have been visiting Westvleteren Abbey since the late eighties. Back then, you turned up on spec, no appointment or reservation needed, and loaded up. 10 crates was the max. If you are lucky, you can get two crates now. Or a take out pack of six, or two, from the cafe opposite the monastery gates. This is what hype has done. But also, has not. This beer is the same now as I remember it >30 years ago. No succumbing to fad or fashion. Now, a further, but very important point. Listen to the monks! Westvleteren is made to age. It really does get more surreal with months, even years on it, if stored cool. Yesterday I cracked open a bottle from my stash brewed in January 2019. For me, it has cream and ginger characteristics, and they were really getting a hold here and singing. For you - well, you decide. Even the taste evolution from the February release was interesting. Its texture, too, is like no other. You don't just taste it - you hear it. So. Drinking Westveleteren 12 (and 8 and 6 for that matter) is a ceremony. A truly personal experience, whether you are religious, agnostic or an atheist. Meanwhile, the myth shrugs its shoulders and keeps on delivering one world class, perhaps once in a lifetime, experience. Visit the Abbey. And have your ceremony.. Finally. Just a note on its price. Bear with me here. If you are lucky enough to get to reserve a crate or two to collect, or buy it at the Cafe opposite the monastery, remember this. This beer is not supposed to be for resale. It is, however, MASSIVELY good value. A world class bargain. The rip off merchants that make this available through resell are doing so against the spirit of what Westvleteren beer is all about. So, feel the guilt if you bought this off site - but do not criticise the price you paid for it.	5
577	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	(330 ml bottle, slightly overfilled, cap date 27.09.21; purchased in Belgium by my bro, shipped to US; chilled for 6 days before opening... decanted into 0,15 l Westvleteren chalice). L: clear, garnet liquid; tan foam, loose upon pour, but settles to steady cap, draping lace... maybe should've left the bottle to settle a lot longer, as there's an alarming amount of nucleation. S: sherry, dates, brown sugar upon first whiff, giving way to rich brown bready malts; perhaps a faint vinous note, but not overtly boozy; moderate intensity in this glass.  1,341 characters	4.4
578	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"Poured into a tulip from a bottle dated 4.01.2018
L: chestnut brown, murky, tiny bubbles arising from the murk
S: like grape candy and maybe some licorice. Smells not like anything I’ve had from beer. Very low if any alcohol presence
T: grape, grape soda, and chocolate brownie. No taste of alcohol
F: lingers then fades softly on the tongue. Surprisingly easy to drink
O: Definitely now understand why it’s considered the best beer in the world."	5
579	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"33cl bottle into a snifter. Look: Pours a gorgeous deep amber with a dark purple/red hue to it. Light tan head dissolves into a ring around the glass.
Smell: Brown sugar, dates, red grape, dark marble bread, and prune. A smokey quality there as well.
Taste: Much like it's aroma, dark pitted fruit and brown sugar, the smokey quality is much less pronounced here. but there is a wine-like tanic dryness on the finish.
Feel: Soft medium bodied, with small foamy bubbles and a dry, tanic finish.
Overall: Fantastic! Dark fruit, dark grain, brown sugar all mixes with a dryness that keeps the sweetness from lingering."	4.52
580	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"I went to the abbey last week, and brought two six packs home, $25 per six-pack. The best pure beer I have ever had. It is easy to add ingredients or to age beer in whiskey barrels to change the flavor, but that is not making pure beer.
I think I'll become a monk and join the abbey, just so I can drink it everyday."	5
581	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	I have often heard that if you make something hard to get or hard to find the public will want it all the more. I finally found this beer after realizing you cannot get it at their brewery and that the pub they serve it at across the street is often closed. I finally found it at an oyster bar in Ghent. It poured a nice brown with a good deal of carbonation. I found it was smooth, drinkable and enjoyable but completely overhyped. Tasted to me more like a German double than a Belgium quad and for the ridiculous price of 16 euro's a bottle it is a true avoid.	3.78
582	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"just thought i'd stop in and pile on. finally blessed to pop one open. it is no lie, all that they say.. a cloudy grey-plum hue held up to a bright light. no noticable particulates swimming about.
a persistent surface fizz in the glass, nearly menacing.
complexities of the sweet, stone-fruit and bitter. deep and pronounced.
like a razzle-dazzle maze upon the tongue and senses, it lingers.. now, the task is to protect my stash from myself... special milestone occasions only!!"	5
583	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Amazing beer. Burnt sugar, fruit, pear maybe, fig, peppery. Smooth and sweet with a bitter finish. Very carbonated and tasty. Was definitely worth getting my chance to try it.	4.75
584	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Friend brought this back from Belgium. It's several years old and a bit funky, not quite in the same league as Trappist Rochefort 10, but then again who knows. Pretty good. Funky	4.21
585	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"I've tasted Westvleteren 8 first and then 12 right after 8.
L-Very similar to 8. Dark brown body and beige foam on the top with nice thickness.
S-Can imagine the taste would be sweet. Blueberry, prune, bready.
T-Nice sweetness from the beginning, while 8 has sweetness from the middle to end. I'm not big fan of too much sweetness such as speedway mokaside, but both 8 and 12 has very nice, semi-sweetness
F-Creamy, foamy very smooth
O-Most expensive ever, best beer ever."	5
586	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Poured from bottle at home. I tried this once in 2017 and did not enjoy it quite as much as I do this time around. The carbonation was not as elevated in this current version which is nice. A real nice mix of sugar and spice.	4
587	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	After having it in the American gift brick from a number of years ago, now I'm finally in Belgium able to enjoy it at the source. The epitome of a Belgian quad. Brown sugar and chocolate with Belgian spices and a bit of raisin, exceptionally smooth and exceptionally complex.	4.71
588	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	It's just so damn drinkable. Tastes like a 7% abv beer, no sickly oversweetness or bitterness, or really anything. There's nothing that particularly stands out, and that's why it's so good. You just don't think about it much, it goes down so easily. Perfectly balanced creation.	4.72
589	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	I got to drink this across the street from the abbey. Luscious and full, I was struck by the balance between alcohol and sweet flavors. Simultaneously a liquid lunch and clean on the palate. The alcohol cleanses the palate after the cacophony of flavors of ripe fruits, caramel, and molasses. I was amazed that a beer this rich left me itching for more, as I would expect the richness to be over-satiating. Just the opposite.	4.7
590	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"L: Opaque, reddish brown, a bit muddy. Thin head.
S: Fruit, both sweet and dry, caramel, a bit of cellar. Complex and strong.
T: Intense but nuanced. Malt, dry fruit, toffee, a bit of booze.
F: Big body but moderate carbonation. Rather dry finish.
O: Simply outstanding."	4.66
591	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"Sourced from a team-buy import crate.
Consumed at around 50F temp as Belgians are made to consume at deep cellar temps.. Gloriously brown and Belgian.. Taste is similar to its sibling St, Bernardus Abt 12 but with more ""hair"" on it, probably due to slight differences in yeast and water. Very rich and almost overwhelming..  442 characters"	4.93
592	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"I've been saving this for some years and until now I realize that the cap of the bottle has a date, which most likely is a best before date (11.03.18), and it is a few months overdue. Let's hope those months did not tinker negatively with the bevy of surprises this has to offer.. Served in a Chimay chalice, it pours a very dark brown, opaque, with a two-finger creamy and frothy head with decent retention.
The heads starts to diminish and it leaves a small layer of foam with a clear efervescent epicenter on top, where the lively carbonation continues to express itself.
The pour was delicate and purposeful, leaving the yeast sediments in the bottle to get a first impression of the beer without them, and despite of that some chunks of matter are visibly starting to precipitate slowly from the head to the bottom of the chalice.. The nose is not as assertive as I would have thought. I don't know if those overdue months are coming back to haunt me or if the sediments in the bottle are needed to aromatize the entirety of the chalice. Nonetheless, a gentle swirl suffices to get a notion of the bouquet.
Faint notes of dark fruits, a bit of spices.
The head will not yield, those previous swirls resurrected the foam and the efeverscent epicenter is still going strong..  2,983 characters"	5
593	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Had a friend bring it back from Amsterdam (hard to find there too!) Tasted a lot like the St Bernardus Abt 12 but with maybe less of a bitter aftertaste. A thicker head than most similar beers. Malty, rich flavor. Beautiful color.	4.57
594	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"This might be the most respectable beer in the world and known as the best trappist beer. This one was four years old.
It pour very dark brown color with medium lasting medium sized off white head. It has strong lacing. Aroma is very complex, it smells strongly of molasses, dark bread, raisin and berry like fruits. One of the most complex taste ever! Taste is moderately high sweet and subtle bitter, malt-hop balance tilts toward malt. You can realize different flavors in every sip. Raisin, molasses, licorice, fig, toffee and berry like frutiness... there is a perfect combination of many flavors. Finish is dry and strongly spicy. Great belgian yeast character! Very full bodied and it has moderate carbonation. Abv is well hidden and %10 abv is undetectable. And the best part, this is very easy to drink. Not my favorite beer of all time due to high sweetness and lack of hops, but it really deserves its fame and respect. As I always say monks know beer!"	4.38
595	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"Huge aroma of dried cherries & figs upon first pour. Has the requisite Belgian yeast foamy head with lots of carbonation in the form of microscopic bubbles. A bit too carbonated & foamy for me, but a few quick swirls of the glass fixes that. Definitely a big beer, it is amazing this beer is made with only 4 ingredients. Lots of dried fruits, molasses, a bit boozy. Great brew.
Thanks to Chad for sharing!. 1/10/15
Bottle
5 rating"	4.8
596	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	Deep amber mahogany color pretty 1 finger head, off white. Prominent phenolic notes, banana and clove, boozy, a savory quality, some chocolate. Malt forward, fruit, but less of it than st bern, crisp, but not sharp, pleasant estery quality marries very well with phenols and malt, crisp sweetness and touches of cherry.  630 characters	4.75
597	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	330 ml fresh bottle in a bar in Brugge, BE. poured into goblet.. pours a very dark brown, moderate tan head. rich malty aroma - dark fruit, toffee. taste is fairly dry - not sweet at all. medium bodied.. overall a bit disappointed in this fresh - luckily I was able to bring home a few bottles to age, I think this will improve a bunch like the similar St. Bernardus	4.23
598	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	"L: wow, deep dark color
S: so many flavors, where to start.
T: best beer In the world. Sweet, spice, linguring wonderful ness
F: each and every part of the mouth is an experience
O: still the best in the World"	5
599	Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII)	As shocking as it sounds, worth the $65 for 12 oz. If you are a fan of Trappist/Belgium variety, this beer is a must try. It is amazing on the nose, mouthful and taste. Perhaps the perfect beer.	5
600	Dinner	Bottle: Poured a clear yellow color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus hoppy floral undertones with some dry hops notes. Taste is also dominated by citrus hops floral undertones with some dry hops notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable but hops were not as dominant as I was expecting. This beer has probably been surpassed by some of the newcomers.	3.86
601	Dinner	The boys at Maine Beer just don't ever make a bad brew. This is so well balanced and drinks like a single, no alcohol warmth feel whatsoever, juicy and flavorful!	4.63
602	Dinner	"16.9oz Bottle poured into a Teku glass.. Look: Pours a slightly hazy orange/amber with a foamy white head that leaves thick, sticky lacing all over the glass.
Smell: Tropical fruit, mostly pineapple and mango with some citrus and green melon. A slightly piney finish.
Taste: Pineapple, mango, citrus and a piney finish. Much like the nose with a slightly different balance.
Feel: Medium with persistent carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: Excellent doesn't quite describe it. Now I'm not sure if I prefer Lunch or Dinner...."	4.63
603	Dinner	Pretty expensive but the quality is high. Very smooth and great notes of hops and balance. Enjoyed this with seafood for a great pairing. Brewery continues to put out great beer	4.82
604	Dinner	probably one of the top 3 balanced IPAs I’ve had ever. even with all the other haze craze hype bombs out there, this bright citrusy piney yum juice kicks ass with its hop character and doesn’t decimate your gullet. Glad I finally tried it on draft and bottle. Win.	4.49
605	Dinner	Picked up a pint sized bottle while visiting the brewery 8/31/19 for $8.00. Bottled on 8/30/19; consumed on 8/31/19.. Beer poured orange with a nice white head with the original pour.. Nose is lovely, mango and pineapple forward, very pungent..  608 characters	4.45
606	Dinner	I can’t add more to what others have written so I will only say my first Dinner every bit lived up to its reputation. AND I was able to buy as much as I wanted (six of the little beauties). Yay me. I am 72 years old and my taste senses aren’t what they used to be so I cannot rate beers like I would when I was 50 but this beer I tried the best I could to “perc” my old senses. I feel it’s about as high as I could rate a beer now based on my aging nose and taste buds.	4.68
607	Dinner	16oz bottle, dated 7.26.19, poured into a 14oz snifter glass.. The beer pours a golden color, hazy and cloudy with amber and orange hues and a nice head of soapy white head, a little over a finger tall that has nice retention and yields tremendous swatches of sticky lacing. The aroma is amazing, bright peach fruit, mango puree, orange juice, very tropical with a fragrant bouquet of wildflower and a dank grassiness that brings out some earthy pine as well. The flavors are very nice, but skew to the bitter and earthier side, whereas the nose leads with a bright punch of fruit forward hop expression. There is still an ample amount of tropical character but the beer is roaring with raw and green hop leaf, grassy and dank, assertive citrus rind with a nice spicy and bitter strafe on the tongue such that the malt bill is merely an afterthought relative to any specific flavor. The mouthfeel is great, coating and lively medium body, crisp and bone dry with a hearty finish that offers a touch of boozy warmth.. Verdict: A really delightful IPA from Maine that offers a very fragrant and expressive nose that brings out the bright and delicate nature of the hop blend while the flavors deliver on a beautifully bitter experience that brings a beer brewed at the extremes into an approachable and practical balance.	4.55
608	Dinner	I'm a lover of Maine Beer Company, but have never been able to find this one... A wonderful co-worker of mine brought me back one from their recent vacation... Honey colored, light carbonation and a rich creamy white froth in terms of appearance... The aroma can be detected without even bring one's nose close the glass... Citrus and melon with a touch of dankness... The flavor profile is hop forward, but no over powering, with a very light and limited malt backbone... A lot more piney hop presence than the nose would lead you to believe... Perhaps even a touch of pepper... The hop presence slightly intensifies post swallow... Mouthfeel is dense with a bit a chalky finish... Overall as expected - a well crafted hop forward expression that is a pleasure to sip and enjoy...	4.33
609	Dinner	Pours a hazy medium orange with a half inch, well retained white head, fine visible carbonation and excellent lacing. Smells of tropical fruit , orange, pine and resin. Tastes of orange, grapefruit pith, mango, peach, herbal elements, pine and resin. Medium bodied and carbonation, dry and lingering bitter finish.	4.71
610	Dinner	I have been waiting a long time to try this one. It is abou 4 weeks old, poured into a stemless wine glass. The taste/smell is tropical fruit (possibly mango), with some orange citrus. The beer starts with a nice malty sweetness, but ends with a strong piney/spicey bitterness. Medium mouthfeel for style, a little more carbonated then many of the newer age DIPA's. This one also pours very hazey, but not turbid. It is a light orange color, with a white head that leaves lacing on the glass. It was worth the $8 to try it, but willlikely never buy another bottle at that price. If however, I see it on draft somewhere at a reasonable price then I will try again. great beer that is drinkable and complex. The piney hoppiness/bitterness keeps me coming back for more.	4.74
611	Dinner	"2019-07-19
500ml bottle served in a little sample glass. Dated 06/28/19. Brought home from the Northeast by my in-laws.. Pours mostly clear light yellow/amber, medium head, medium carbonation. Smell is fruity, tropical, a little pineapple, maybe mango.. Taste is dry, surprisingly bitter and resinous, with the tropical fruit juice in the background. It's nice -- juicy but not a juice bomb..  454 characters"	4.24
612	Dinner	"Poured from a bottle dated 6/18/19 to a Nonic.
The aroma is amazing. It hit me while I was pouring, while bringing it to the table, sitting down, all before I took an intended sniff. Lemonade, tangerine, green herbs, orange peel.
Medium head that laces well on top of a deep gold slightly hazy body.
Taste is orange aid with a dry hit in the middle malty sweet taste lingers with a reminder of the citrus wack.
Carbonation is appropriate, cleaning the reasonable body well but not like a fizz fest.
A beer that deserves its reputation."	4.74
613	Dinner	Bottle poured into a teku glass. Hazy orange liquid , small streams of carbonation, two finger off white , rocky, foamy big bubbled carbonation, good retention ,settles after five minutes to rocky islands and a solid layer. Aroma is citrus , tangerine.  398 characters	4.6
614	Dinner	16oz bottle poured into a snifter.. A: Sunny golden color with a mild haze. Creamy off-white head stands at a finger and a half. Spotty lacing.. S: Freshly slice mango, lemon verbena, catty, candied lemon peel, tangerine, maybe even some strawberry. Green. Sturdy malt base of caramel and toast. Intensely fresh and fruity hop aroma..  1,205 characters	4.16
615	Dinner	"A-Pours a nice hazy orange color with a nice head and lacing.
A-Aroma has very nicely balanced resin, dank and tropical hints.
T-Taste follows the nose with very well balanced resin, dank and tropical flavors.
M-A medium bodied well balanced, well carbonated and complex flavored beer.
O-Another great beer from a great brewery."	4.75
616	Dinner	The pour is hazy dark orange, semi-transparent, with a short white head and massive small bubble lacing. Nose is strong hop funk, resin and dank, tropical notes and garlic. The flavor is full of mango and peach, orange juice and a back end of grapefruit pith and resin. The feel is surprisingly clean, given the explosive range of hop flavors. This is a superb IPA that works with big dry hopping that is the cornerstone of the NE style.	4.65
617	Dinner	Not cloudy. That’s the point. Nice lacing over a slightly viscous golden body. Really great nose - one of the best I’ve smelled in a while with pure pineapple orange juice with some hints of rind. The malt on this beer compliments it well on the taste - almost a candy coating without being to much so or washing out dryness. Way too easy to drink. Damn good beer.	4.57
618	Dinner	32 oz crowler poured into a teku. A- A slightly hazy golden orange with a two finger white head.. S- Blueberries, melons, peaches, citrus, hints of tropical fruits, earthy, a little piney dankness, hints of caramel malts. Incredibly well balanced nose..  635 characters	4.77
619	Dinner	MAINE DINNER DIPA 5/21/19. Have wanted to try this top-rated brew since it came out, now made available to me via my beer savvy daughter who lives close enough to reach the brewery in a more or less reasonable drive. Thanks, Jenny!. Poured from the 16.9 oz. bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip..  860 characters	4.63
620	Dinner	L: Looks like honey in a glass. Thick and syrupy looking.. S: Honey, orange peel,. T: Honey, meadish tasting, bitter orange peel, very dry, smooth, well balanced, definitely tastes expensive. Resiny, alcohol is present..  331 characters	4.17
621	Dinner	Solid New England IPA, similar to Treehouse and others of the style. Very heavy hops in this beer, but not too bitter. Hazy amber/straw color w white head.	4.4
622	Dinner	Hazy light yellow-orange, clearly effervescent, with a fat finger of thick near-white head. Sheets of lacing. Big orange and pineapple in the nose. A hint of cream, too. Light, tropical and delicious smelling. More watered down tasting — like most Maine IPAs — retaining the citrus and tropical flavors up front, adding in a weird semi-grassy bitterness and touch of mineral water. Tasty, but not as magical as the aroma. Lightly smokey herbs in the lightly bitter aftertaste. On the light side of medium bodied, especially for the style, with strong carbonation. Very good beer, with nice complexity in the taste, but still leaving me want a little more.	4.17
623	Dinner	The remarkable thing about Dinner is its subtlety. Many great IPAs, like Heady Topper are very aggressive, an assault upon the senses. Dinner comes in delicate waves, and lasts.	4.74
624	Dinner	Big thanks to Dave for this gem. Cheers man!. An intensely yellow-orange body glows with a some opacity like a dimly lit light bulb. Capped by a rocky yet plush looking white foam above, this beer looks inviting, yet special.. It smells special too. Orchard fruits of soft sweetness pop. Peach. Orange..  795 characters	4.48
625	JJJuliusss	"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
10/10/19
Served in a teku. Fantastic appearance. The cloudy, mustard yellow body was topped by a fluffy, two-finger tall, off-white crown that slowly fell to a bubbly film. A craggily latticework of lacing coated the glass from top to bottom and stuck around until the drink’s end.. The nose contained a terrific melding of citrus and tropical fruit notes. Freshly squeezed orange juice dominated. Ripe mango was also noticeable. Bit of tangerine as well. As the beer sat, the signature Tree House yeastiness really came forth. Later, the fruity notes reappeared. Touch of peach too..  1,509 characters"	4.39
626	JJJuliusss	Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a nice head and great lacing. Aroma and flavor are tropical & citrus fruit with some soft malt and a hint of raw/vegetal/green that is a tiny bit harsh on the palate. Very good but not quite what I was hoping for.	4.29
627	JJJuliusss	Limited quantity but well worth the wait. The golden hue of the glass already emanated a subdued tropical smell. The taste is like no other like champagne with strawberries. The texture of the beer is mid range carbonation bite with a flurry of memorable flavors. The question is how is this done in a glass of beer. The entire experience of drinking a can of this beer is like drinking a world class burgundy. The flavor and aromas seem to change as you drink the glass until there is nothing left but the aroma of a great beer. See you in line . . .	4.98
628	JJJuliusss	16 oz. can. Murky orange. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit. Tastes of tropical fruit, slightly sweet pale malt, melon hops, and a little bitterness. Medium body. At some point, I think you can't taste more hops. It's an amped up Julius. Very good.	4
629	JJJuliusss	Was kind of murky, not a bright NE as expected, but it didn’t carry any oxidized flavors or really anything other than ripe, juicy goodness. Good feel, very crushable	4.71
630	JJJuliusss	Pours a hazy golden murky color, very protein rich. I feel like I am broken record for these TH reviews but it doesn't look great but it doesn't look terrible. There is good head retention. There's intense tropical aroma, I get mango and papaya. Oh yeah, that's nice . There's a touch of grapefruit on the finish, which provides some nice edge to the tropical nature of this beer.. My one qualm is you can't pour out the full can due to hop trub that creates a bitter and acidic burn, which is a huge bummer.	4.26
631	JJJuliusss	Pulpy orange juice. Smell is fresh squeezed oj. Taste starts with pulpy oj, mid is bitter marmaladde, finish is a touch of bready sweetness also maybe fruity lychee. Never mind definitely sweet lychee finish. Feel is classic soft TH. Overall it's fresh pressed oj with lots of pulp	4.79
632	JJJuliusss	Tall can, from the source via a friend, canned 10/10/19...IE 4 days ago.... Pours fully hazed, light pumpkin in color, under a lasting and lasting light khaki cap and leaving great looking ringed sheeting down low and looser and more spotty sheeting up higher on the glass.. Delicious smelling brew with heavy orange and pineapple juice all over the sniff..  542 characters	4.6
633	JJJuliusss	Beautiful orange-heavy, juicy-as-hell beer with deep haze and almost no head. Nothing but sweet orange and dank grass on the nose. Not complex or layered, but gloriously juicy. Taste follows with sweet citrus juice, dank greens, pine resin, and a tropical stone fruit finish. Nice herbal notes as well. A little thin but silky smooth.. My first Tree House experience. Not the most nuanced beer in the category, but did not disappoint in terms of the tastiness, drinkability, and it's remarkable sweet orange juice personality. So damn flavorful for a 6% (ish) beer.	4.44
634	JJJuliusss	This beer was fantastic and hard to critique anything about it. Enjoyed in plastic at the brewery outdoors. Beautiful color of orange with notes of orange and tangerine on nose/pallet. Get while you can!	4.94
635	JJJuliusss	Another incredible juicy, hazy, pillowy soft New England IPA from this amazing brewery. This one did not disappoint, and actually I would rate this as one of my top three IPAs ever (along with Green and Doubleganger). Canned date 8/1/19 so this was quite fresh. Pours a very hazy, cloudy yellow-orange, nearly opaque color with a little white fluffy head and some spotty lingering lacing. I would have given it higher marks for appearance if there were more lacing present on the glass. Smells absolutely amazing, lots of ripe fruit - grapefruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine, papaya, guava, passionfruit, lemon and a little melon. Also a good hit of floral hops, herbal hops, creamy vanilla, bread and malt. Taste follows the nose, and again there’s a trademark Tree House creaminess, juiciness and amazing blend of hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Mouthfeel is very tough to beat, amazingly pillowy-soft, as others have described. Very luscious, sticky on the palate, smooth and perfect amount of carbonation. Truly an awesome beer.	4.61
636	JJJuliusss	Less than 2 weeks old in the can. Served in a Tree House snifter glass.. Cloudy pulpy golden body, slight orange hue, one and half finger frothy white head, good retention and staying power. Frothy, globs of lacing. Smell is reminiscent of Julius. Big juicy citrus and orange, with that similar bit of dough and cereal but even further into the background. I think proportionately, there is a fair bit more of a hop bite to it, but ultimately it reminds me more of the old Julius than a bigger and better version of the current Julius. That's okay though- this is pretty delicious and certainly overhopped in a good way. Sweet hop nectar on the palate- grapefruit and oranges all the way through, plus a fairly solid herbal resin to it, giving a mild resinous bitterness- presumably from the kettle hopping. Not that much more alpha acid in it, and that's good. Medium bodied, soft and creamy, good carbonation. Mildly zesty citrus on the finish lingering through after the leafy hops and grapefruit have faded away.	4.49
637	JJJuliusss	16oz can, dated 08.01.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass.. The beer pours a very turbid and hazy orange color, amber and honey hues with a foamy white head, about a finger tall that has modest retention but yields lots of sticky and soapy lacing. The aroma is wonderful, exploding with valencia orange juice, bright tropical mango, soft wildflower, sweet yeast and pale dough balanced by a more bitter profile of piney and dank, raw hop leaf that offers a nice bit of balance. The flavors are nice, loads of valencia orange juice, mango puree, light pineapple with a doughy malt bill, soft yeast, modest candied orange peel that bridges the gap between sweet and bitter. Pine, grassy and green hop leaf with a bit of spice and oiliness at the back palate. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy with a heavier medium body that has a warm and drier finish that is a bit slick and oily in texture that mimics the flavors.. Verdict: A very nice NEIPA from Tree House. It's definitely Julius taken to the extreme but sometimes the extreme isn't exactly where something needs to be. The oiliness of this beer is very present and the raw, overhop flavor permeates through all layers of this beer. It's blunt and raw and unforgiving where Julius finds that nice soft touch and has finesse.	4.07
638	JJJuliusss	"Canned on 8/1. Poured to TH Glass on 8/5. Was 3 cans per person limit.
A:VERY hazy. Light Orange colour. Half finger of the crowds. Limited lace.
S:Peach, Pineapple, Mango. Quite comfortable aromas.
T:Creamy first. Medium Carbo. Inexperienced balance between Sweetness and bitterness.
Clear after taste.
M:Robust, gutsy and rich balance but clean and smooth !
O:Great NEIPA. After taste is great. Sweetness is not sticky.
Personally, better than Julius for me.
6.8%ABV"	4.74
639	JJJuliusss	With Julius seems it is love hate thing, well this is pure love. nice big hop noise of that citrus and just enough malt sweetness to balance it all out. The look poured in a class was a little more muddle/murky but the flavors made it up for. Too bad this was only 2pp.	4.64
640	JJJuliusss	God this is good. Orange rind on the coloration, such orange zest on the nose. Orange and Mango coat the palate like julius, but jjj does it in a much more full way. Much more full bodied than the classic, but doesn't quite pack the punch that KJ does. It's a very nice balance. Excellent beer.	4.84
641	JJJuliusss	Opaque tan-yellow with a large, airy off-white froth settling to a lumpy uneven blanket leaving spiderweb lace.. Sweet juicy clementine and tangerine explode in the fluid medium-light body. A firmly satisfying carbonation lifts additional notes of light biscuit and green herbal hop spice that has a faint peppery dankness. A hint of smoothie-like vanilla comes out in the bubbly, semi-dry swallow.. Doing a side by side with regular Julius, I still find the OG delicious, but the citrus characteristics of JJJ are on another level. Like wow. This makes regular seem way more mild and pedestrian, which I didn't think I'd say, as I hold classic Dr. J above KJ and even KJJJ.	4.62
642	JJJuliusss	Pours a murky, turbid white-orange with two fingers of dense, white foam with little fluffy islands retaining a long while. Aroma is tangerine, nectarine, orange, mango and lemongrass for a puree of tropical fruits. Malts are obscured by the hops and are nonexistent. Flavor profile carries a little more sweetness forward, again, with a lengthy list of tropical fruit descriptors - mango, nectarine, tangerine, orange, mandarin orange, lemon and guava. A little residual sugar sits on the tongue, akin to eating a ripe mango or tangerine. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fluffy, lightly grainy texture. Overall, aroma is big tropical fruits, but the flavor profile drives it up a notch.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can.	4.61
643	JJJuliusss	"Look: dark hazy orange
Smell: super danky, great tropical smell and a hint of lemon grass
Taste: amazing tropical fruit with a lemon grass finish
Feel: so creamy and easy to drink
Overall: GOAT of IPAs"	4.8
644	JJJuliusss	"Canned 2 months ago.. L — Deep orange haze with two fingers of dense white head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing
S — Smells like Julius for sure. Tons of orange creamsicle, clementine, lemon zest, bubblegum… At two months out it smells like a fresh can of regular Julius
T — Juicy orange, peach, jasmine green tea, hint of mango. Has a little more of a kick than Julius
F — Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. Less soft and fluffy than most TH hoppy offerings I’ve had, this one is almost on the verge of being watery. Might just be the moderate age on this, but not positive
O — I mean, it’s a Tree House IPA, what more do I need to say?. 90/100"	4.45
645	JJJuliusss	poured from a 16oz can into a stemmed bulb glass. pours a foggy, murky orange. good amount of white foam and decent lacing. smell is a heavenly bouquet of ripe tropical fruits. taste leaves a little something to be desired. it’s not a bad tasting beer, but the nose is so explosive that you expect the same from the taste. instead, it kind of dies off in the back end. doesn’t pop like regular julius does. feel is top notch, as per usual with most tree house IPAs. overall, beyond decent beer but worth going the extra mile for when you could get 12 regular julius? no. essentially julius with an amplified nose, perhaps slightly better looking in the glass and not as good of flavor / taste.	4.48
646	JJJuliusss	Beer from Tree House never seems to fail when it arrives at my front door. Love having a pipeline to their beer, by far my favorite brewery, even more than the good ones we have in California.. JJJuliusss pours a hazy, bright orange juice color with a light one finger, white head leaving some sticky lacing. The smell is big and juicy with mango, orange pith and grapefruit with some sweet honeydew melon. Taste is very nice, much like the nose, it's juicy with mango, orange, grapefruit and tangerine with a slight pine finish.	4.6
647	JJJuliusss	this is incredible - reminds me of a more hopped up version of the first treehosue i ever had, which was a J. creamy, smooth, grainy, orange juice and mango, sweet and velvety. just perfect!	4.75
648	JJJuliusss	Hazy mango flesh color. Good retention and spotty lacing. Smells of citrus fruit, grass and some dank as it warms. Bright citrus fruit, peach and apricot flavors. Loads of hop bitterness which lingers a loooong time. Medium bodied with a refreshing fizz feel. Definitely not a creamy textured beer, in my opinion. Can't compare it to other Tree House IPA's. It has a style of its own. It's great...	4.38
649	JJJuliusss	Look: A beautiful metallic orange color. Feel: very good; not the best feel on a TH beer I’ve ever had though.. Smell: this thing smells like Trader Joe’s Orange Mango Peach juice with a dank edge. It’s like a smoothie. You also get a ripe pear/kiwi dank quality. Very tropical aroma, but doesn’t burst out like some other TH IPAs.  670 characters	4.77
650	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	I'm not normally a fan of unusually flavored beers, but this is pretty good. Black as night, with an extremely distinct coffee smell and taste. Smells good, tastes good.	4.32
651	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"Second time having this beer. 2014 bottle was my first, 2018 bottle is my current.. My thoughts are generally the same... wow! Being from Kentucky myself, I love the flavor of this beer.. It's dense, pours black with a tiny head of foam, a little lacing, and looks opaque black in the glass. Smells richly of coffee, chocolate, molasses... alcohol content is pretty forward, but the ""burn"" is well-masked by the hit of flavor. The mouthfeel is divine. Silky smooth, rich, coats the mouth, and leaves a lingering roasty-toastiness that is gorgeous, especially in these colder months..  806 characters"	4.84
652	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"12oz bottle. ""2019 release"" with a date and batch number. About 9 months old at the time of this review. This version weighs in at 12.2% ABV. Dark black glugger, not much foam, all motor oil with a mocha ring. Smell is whisky fumes mixing with a chocolate and coffee base. But some expensive-ass quality whisky, chocolate and coffee. The taste is an immaculate combination of stout, oak barrel whisky, chocolate nibs, and a dark roasted coffee, all enveloped in warm alcohol. The perfect beer for a cool night during the colder seasons. A delicious sipper that warms you as you enjoy. Lantern oil for the soul"	4.52
653	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"Look: Body is pure black, chocolate-beige head about a finger thick. Moderate lacing and retention.. Smell: Simple, yet strong personalty. Potent and bitter chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, vanilla, and altogether masked within the scent of a pungent oak barrel. Quite floral.. Taste: Tastes like a beer that is ""very alive"". The bourbon taste is obvious, but the other primary notes include strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate, cherries, smoke and molasses. Others are the vanilla, cereal, and alcohol. To me, like I said, it's simple but very delicious..  575 characters"	4.45
654	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Pours pitch black with 1/4 inch brown head. Moderate lacing. Light carbonation. Some sediment.. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, molasses, oak.. Tastes of strong coffee, chocolate, roast malts, black malt, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, vanilla..  425 characters	4.9
655	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Had on tap at BJ's Brewhouse in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas. Somehow I'd never had a chance to try it before, but I am certainly glad I finally did. A classic beer that truly lives up to its own hype.	4.44
656	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	I love a good stout when it's still cold outside. KBS is by far my favorite. There's not even a close second. I only wish this were more readily available living in VT.	5
657	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	I should start this off by saying that stout are not one of my favorite styles, but holy hell is this good. Huge shoutout to CraftBeerKings.com for making it possible for me to try this, and it was on sale!. Bottled 2/11/19. From a 12 oz 2019 bottle into a snifter, it pours an opaque black with a brown tan head that holds up for quite a while.  1,562 characters	4.22
658	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Poured into my tulip this beer is dark. I mean dark. Darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. Two finger foamy bubbly taupe-brown head slides down slowly leaving soapy lace on the glass.. Scent is bourbon (and how!) and bitter chocolate. Cold brew coffee. Vanilla. Raisins.. Taste is chocolate, both bitter dark and sweet milk. Chocolate cherries. Ooohh there's the bourbon - in a long dramatic lingering finish. There's a notable alcohol warming in the throat. Espresso. Raisins and figs. Mocha. Capuccino. Marzipan. Toffee. This is a boozy dessert in a glass. There are also subtle notes of char and hop bitterness in the background which only become apparent after the initial chocolate/coffee and bourbon flavors have said their peace. Chocolate is the dominant flavor here and though there is certainly some sweetness it is in no way cloying and is balanced nicely by the bitter notes..  1,310 characters	4.79
659	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Pours completely black, beige head. Small bubbles. Sticky lacing.. Aromas of sweet chocolate, oak, bourbon, coffee, and a bit of a fresh floral note.. Taste is big dense chocolate followed by coffee and bourbon..  289 characters	4.58
660	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	It’s black, as dark as my house suffering through another LADWP power outage. Puny brown head. Aroma is just coffee & dark chocolate. Sweet with a touch of bitterness. Dark chocolate is the dominant flavor, then the coffee followed by cereal, bourbon, vanilla, oak & alcohol. Very thick & silky smooth with plenty of alcohol & carbonation to tickle the tongue. I’m a big fan of barrel aged & high alcohol content. This is way better than my typical breakfast.	4.5
661	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"2019 Version: The most approachable year of KBS we've ever had. Its a toned done year, with less bold bourbon punch, but with more coffee and chocolate flavors. This is the most ""normal"" KBS has ever been, and that could be seen as either a negative or a positive."	3.83
662	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"It's a good beer, but damn what an ugly label. I continually advocate for ""Label"" being a ratable value like Look Smell Taste Feel. I would give this 3.5. The Old Western font is hard to read and the whole thing looks like one of those ""Wanted: [Your Name]"" novelty posters you pick up at Frontier Land after panning for gold. But, it's a good stout."	4.05
663	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	12oz bottle. 12.2% ABV.. Imagine a flavor almost as good as Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, but in a beer with a thicker Guinness-esque feel. The beer packs a wallop. Incredibly smooth, great flavor, and very strong.. Price makes this a once a year beer for me.	4.32
664	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"Thick - almost oozes from the bottle. Burned motor oil brown, with a one finger head swirling with different tans.
Chocolate, coffee and alcohol - like a Black Russian
Holy mole. Sweet with an almost chili pepper burn
Full mouthfeel. Carbonation releases the afterburners.
This one does not mess around - be prepared."	4.55
665	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"From a 12oz. bottle, 3 1/2 month old. Poured with fluffy jamocha hued head. Color is typical stout dark, although there is a slight mahogany tint. Nose is bourbon, chocolate, cherry, very enjoyable. I poured it into a snifter, “someone told me to do it”, yes, it was good advice. The aroma is magnifico. Taste, is “bourbonesque” , chocolate dominates the coffee.
Aftertaste, it’s a back of the pallet bourbon, which is ok.
Overall, a fine “A Flavored Stout”, as written on the label. This will be a occasional diversion for me.
Good job Founders."	4.33
666	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	A bit more of the milky breakfast stout, but that one is really good. Upon pour, the head looked like rich chocolate ice cream, the liquid looked like a frothy cold brew coffee. Maybe the best looking beer I've ever seen (watch out my favorite Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout). Aroma is mostly bourbon with some nuttiness (probably the coffee). Taste was very much bourbon on bourbon. However, it's a bourbon with a lot of depth. Not enough coffee for my tastes. Only reason i didn't rank this perfect is because I'm not a 100% fan of Bourbon in my beer,	4.59
667	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	2018 vintage sampled spring 2019. Opaque black with mahogany highlights and a 1/4 inch mocha head after a vigorous pour, recedes quickly, tiny spots of lace. Massive chocolate bomb, brimming with chocolate syrup and cocoa powder. Balancing notes of vanilla, whiskey, oak, coffee, toffee. The bourbon barrel is prominent but not overwhelming, complimentary to the dominant chocolate malt.	4.01
668	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Doesn't have the same flavor notes as a certain other Bourbon Stout which is released in November which I consider the gold standard. KBS is very good, but the flavor just isn't ramped to that level. For that reason, 4.25.	4.27
669	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Pours pitch black with a very thin medium-light brown head.. Can smell the bourbon whiskey...with dark chocolate and coffee.. Rich smooth creamy taste of chocolates and coffee...with a pleasant tinge of bourbon flavor coming through..  840 characters	4.72
670	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	2018 release, 12oz bottled on 02.15.18, 12.3% ABV. Served in a curved glass. Not big on aroma. Flavor has a rich malty thing with coffee and chocolate being very much secondary. Boozy but very easy drinking and dangerously so. Oak is present, but not overpowering, and vanilla is tertiary at best. Good, and probably much more widely available than in years past, but there are far better RIS out there.	3.85
671	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Poured black like dirty oil with a one finger tan fizzy head that quickly dissipated to a film. Aroma of brown sugar, dark chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Tastes follows the nose but explodes in your mouth with an added oak and an anise/black licorice finish. Then you notice how boozy this gem is. During the pour, you notice how it looks thick like dirty oil. However, the fell is not as oily as expected. It is very nice. The brew leaves a bit of nice stickiness on your lips. Very nice . . . one of the best I've had!	4.7
672	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	Poured from 12oz bottle into Chimay goblet.. L - opaque, oil black-brown pour, no significant head or lacing.. S - Oak staves, vanilla bean, faint alcohol..  428 characters	4.42
673	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	This is a love it or hate it kind of beer. If you love something exotic and different, you'll like this. However, I served it at a party to a traditional Budweiser crowd and many glasses with only one sip taken were left after.. This has a taste as bold as it's black color. There is espresso coffee grounds, black licorice, dark chocolate and a little basil in the taste profile. It's not your average breakfast stout and that unique basil/licorice flavor really sets it aside as a beer flavor I haven't tried before.. One of these at 11-something ABV will leave you a bit tipsy. Mouthfeel is great ... like iced coffee with cream. The foamy head is fantastic. The smell is a bit soy sauce-esque. It is my understanding this is a hard to find beer outside it's April release but I've been seeing it all over even almost into June.	4.71
674	KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)	"L: murky and mysterious. Jet black, totally opaque. Good head retention, originally poured white large.
S: sweet, nutty. Obvious notes of milk chocolate and coffee. Also other dark sugar notes, get a nice rich syrupy aroma, maybe toffee or hot caramel, honestly just super pleasant smell. No detectable alcohol
T: rich dark chocolate character. Almost a little bit more on the savory side of cocoa than overly sweet. Toasted notes, like crisp almost-burnt bread, toasted walnuts. A bit of tannins on the finish, slightly dry. Not necessarily bitter just astringent. Could be from the coffee. Also a slight creamy lactose-like sweetness. Bourbon/oak is really only present on the back end of the palate for me, after I’ve waited a while between sips.
F: really smooth and easy drinking. Silky, but absolutely coats the mouth. Big body, definitely heavy, but it’s not a chore to drink. It goes back really easy for a 12% beer (dangerous!). Carbonation is apparent but it’s on the lower side.
O: really quite a treat to drink this. I can’t really come up with anything wrong with this beer, and can rattle off a list of reasons why it’s amazing. It’s on the pricier side but certainly worth it, not a beer you drink everyday (good luck if you do). Glad I picked this up."	4.69
675	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured from a cracked bottle (damaged during shipping) into a styrofoam cup in the parking ramp over my work lunch hour. After I opened the stained shipping box to find that the bottle still had about 6 ounces in it I decided I just had to try this. Glad I did. Amazing beer loaded with chocolate. Creamy and smooth. If not for the acquisition cost I'd go after another of these.	4.75
676	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my reviews know that I carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stouts because I don’t handle sweetness very well. Some of you may have also noticed that I don’t seem as disenchanted when it comes to barrel-aged stouts and barleywine, when they sometimes taste as sweet, if not sweeter than other representations of pastry stouts available on the market.. Besides the actually unendurable levels of sweetness that set light up my TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 with the force of hellfire, the thing that puts me off most about pastry stouts seem to be the driving force behind its popularity. I’m not going to straight up say that I don’t like pastry stouts because of all the hype and attention they receive, because I myself am guilty of buying into beers and brands that receive hype and attention and actually enjoying them every once in a while, but it’s probably because one of the things I value most about beer is that it’s proletariat and ubiquitous in nature; if I like a beer, I want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one, or run to the store and buy another without feeling like I could have done better things with my money—the reason why I value mouthfeel so much in a beer is because I personally believe that correlates most strongly into how repeatable a beer is no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be, I normally won’t want to try another unless there’s some sense of balance or leveling factor that clears my palate for the next sip.. Given my totally made-up standards and personal values stated above, pastry stouts couldn’t stand any further from brews that I would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for. I’m pretty sure this comment will come back to bite me in the ass when I find myself standing in line for BA Double Stack next month, but I digress..  4,843 characters	4.45
677	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut. Taste is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever tasted, period. Coconut up front, smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like German chocolate cake. The only knock I'll give it is that the barrel doesn't come through a ton in the flavor, but it's hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good. Pretty sweet, but not painfully so. Smooth feel, maybe I'd like it a little bit thicker, but again - this is just quibbling and it's hard to really knock this at all. Fantastic.	4.99
678	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	2018 vintage. Released about a year ago.. A: Pours jet black with a thick cap of dark brown, espresso-like head. Recedes quickly to a sharp ring. A few dots of lacing.. S: Dark cocoa, toasted coconut, oak, vanilla bean ice cream, and bourbon, with light roast and anise rounding things out. Very well balanced between the various aromas..  757 characters	4.67
679	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Thanks to Heisenbrew for this 750ML bottle, which I am taking solo tonight. If you don’t hear from me by Sunday night, please send someone out to check my dead body’s blood sugar level.. Ever go blind? That’s how dark the beer is, with nearly no visible carbonation. The nose is barrel aged brownie whipped up with bitter cocoa. I’d eat that.. Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake – Barrel Aged was easily my favorite beer from Tampa Beer Week 2018, & the bottle doesn’t quite live up to my glowing memories. It is, of course, sweet enough that my vulnerability to type 2 diabetes just ticked upwards 5%. Straight corn syrup mixes with cane sugar & supremely bitter chocolate to form the base: the chocolate actually took a half hour to warm before the nasty edge wore off the bitter cocoa. Below the sweet upper crust is a healthy helping of bourbon, milky chocolate, long pull of vanilla, & cake batter. I don’t believe I typed that. Thick, full, coma-inducing. Pretty sure I’m not going to have any trouble finishing this off by myself. That said, I’m getting full..  1,209 characters	4.25
680	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Exactly what you want a German chocolate cake stout to taste like. Coconut and chocolate throughout with great body and aromas. Maybe a little on the sweet side, but we are splitting hairs at that point	4.64
681	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	I've nearly managed to try Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake stout on two or three occasions now - this time, it did not elude me! I also had the pleasure of trying this side by side with the non-barrel-aged bottle - and while this experience certainly hurt my teeth a bit, it was a pretty great time to be alive!. I've had my fair share of sweet, sticky, dessert beverages, but there's just something about Angry Chair's dessert stouts that surpasses everyone else's attempts - the beers are practically simple syrup in consistency and taste, but then they're also quite high in ABV, and don't taste it for a second. BAIGCCS is like a bucket of fudgy chocolate cake batter goodness - it coats your glass and it's absolutely opaque. The carb is so minimal that it's like drinking a light viscosity glass of motor oil. A delicious one, obviously. The nose is rich and warm, and that chocolate is just excellent on the nose and in the taste buds.. I really liked this beer - but as I told my friends, I think this will be the only time I'll ever drink it, and I'm honestly pretty okay with that. It's just too much - there's no moderation to this beer. It's a bottle that you essentially need to share, because the flavors and syrupyness of the beer is just unrelenting..  1,487 characters	4.5
682	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Pours pitch black with little to no head. Nose it’s bakers chocolate, sweet coconut, getting some barrel heat, grain alcohol. Taste follows the nose, rich milk chocolate, coconut, get a little oak/bourbon note. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Overall, delicious stout. As I’ve stated on several of my BA AC reviews, the only knock this beer is there is not a big barrel presence here. Otherwise, fantastic.	4.66
683	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured from a 750mL bottle into an Angry Chair pint glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this one.. Aromas are straight chocolate cake batter intermingled with some bourbon, cocoa, chocolate fudge, hershey’s syrup.. On the tongue is rich chocolate fudge, sweet chocolate cake with a dark chocolate frosting. Bourbon barrel adds a vanilla-caramel flavor in the background, but the dominant flavor is straight fudge cake. Full-bodied with a rich, thick mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Low carbonation. This is most definitely a sipper..  641 characters	4.75
684	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Pastry stout delight! Poured very dark with a mocha head into a Torst glass. Expected this to be more like motor oil but it wasn’t. Aromas of fudge and subtle coconut release from the glass. Smells like dessert! Flavors are insane. Pretty sweet with fudge brownies, coconut and subtle Barrel/oak. Amazing flavors here. Like I’m sipping on brownie batter. Feel is viscous and mouth coating. Pretty sticky. Overall, this was a treat. Dessert in every way!	4.75
685	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured from a bottle. Motor oil look and pour. Coconut fat floating on top. Smell is coconut, chocolate, vanilla, barrel, amazing. Taste is all of that, plus adding that perfect thick and chewy mouthfeel, you get the perfect beer.	5
686	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Great beer, but I have to say for the value and what I gave up to get this I would rather go for the non ba version. Great beer, where I think the bourbon barrel actually does not add a lot cause there are so many adjuncts. Definitely a chocolate bomb. Gets points because of Angry Chair's dark lacing and overall turbid, oily, thickness that makes it a unique beer.	4.38
687	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Batch 1 bottle, so thick, so sweet. Smells exactly like German cake, great smell. Pours nice and thick. Great dark look. Taste is one of the best. Angry chair barrel aged stouts are fantastic.	5
688	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"batch 1 drank on 3/24/2018 split 4 ways into a snifter. Look - pitch black, low carb but still a little, thick but not massive lacing, still a lot there
Smell - sweet chocolate galore, my oh my. this really is a chocolate bomb that smells like a chocolate cupcake. plenty of vanilla and barrel coming through, but definitely playing second fiddle to the chocolate. the coconut is subtle but opens up more as it warms. really incredible.
Taste - follows the nose, however, i do get some caramel in the taste too. a really nice addition with everything else going on.
Feel-pretty heavy thickness, no booze, finish is exceptional. really coats the mouth and lingers in a terrific way
Overall - the hype is real. This is not overrated and this will age impeccably. I had a small sample a year ago and thinks its improved a ton. I think this may not peak for another 2 year to be honest. Incredible beer and could keep getting better. WOW"	4.75
689	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Hell of a beer! Would I pay the crazy secondary price? No. Very thankful a family member stood in line and got a bottle.
The only detractor with this beer was a soy sauce aroma after initial pour. Thankfully it wasn't present in the taste. That was very much German Chocolate."	4.58
690	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	750ml bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours deep black color with a one-finger khaki colored head that has decent retention and reduces to a ring around the edge. S- tons of barrel aroma up front; bourbon, wet oak & vanilla. Undertones of dark chocolate fudge, caramel, toffee, toasted coconut and light toffee.  853 characters	4.6
691	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Looks like chocolate fudge with a thick khaki head
Smells like fudge and coconut with a hint of bourbon and carmel
Tastes like a big fudgy piece of German cake
This beer lasts forever in your mouth... absolutely amazing"	4.99
692	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Mini share at a SP release. Pours pitch black with smells of sweet bourbon interlaced with chocolate. I've had the non-barrel aged version, and while this is a tad thinner, it makes up with the chocolate flavor. Sweet and glorious chocolate flavor for days. Loved it.	5
693	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"shout out to mcbeerguy for sharing this with us all and well showing us beeradvocate
Look: really dark black and thick
smell: coconut and chocolate, little caramel and bourbon
taste: cake batter and matches the nose with a bourbon finish
feel: lingers forever, medium mouth, no carbination
overall: best beer ever"	5
694	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Look: motor oil black, .5 incur khaki head
Smell: coconut, vanilla, chocolate and bourbon
Taste: it's basically cake batter, big German chocolate cake batter
Feel: medium body, light carbonation and a long lasting taste."	5
695	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Popped a couple of these bottles. Both times poured into teku's.. Look: Moter Oil
Smell: Fresh German Chocolate Cake!! The best nose ever!!
Taste: Huge coconut first then chocolate covered bourbon. Perfect amount of barrel. Absolutely mind blowing
Feel: Moter Oil
Overall: I've had the pleasure of opening a couple bottles of this beer. Both times I was completely amazed. Top 5 beer for me all time!!!"	5
696	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Look: dark brown to black with a think khaki head
Smell: huge barrel, alcohol and chocolate... Big chocolate cake bomb
Taste: huge fudge, coconut, chocolate, more chocolate and more... finish is vanilla and bourbon.
Feel: velvet, low carbonation, sticky long lasting mouth feel... feels like liquid cake. Overall: best beer of 2017, overall it's a big chocolate cake beer with a solid bourbon finish."	4.81
697	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Bottle shared by Ryan. Thank you!. Oily, viscous brown body with nary a head. Aromas of brown sugar, bourbon, toffee, chocolate, oak. Incredible flavor, finishing with a delicate and delectable sweetness. Each sip brings a long lingering aftertaste. Silky smooth palate. Wonderfully complex. Outstanding.	4.72
698	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	This is on a whole other level. Wow! I had the non-ba coffee version and didn't like it at all, so I had tempered expectations. So thick, so chocolaty, smooth coconut flavor that lingers in your mouth. Glad I have a full bottle to revisit.	4.9
699	Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Thick oily black color. Oily layer tops this beer.. Rich, chocolate cake, fudge, and coconut all surrounded by great bourbon, oak, and vanilla flavors. Full bodied with a silky mouthfeel. Basically everything you could ask for in a pastry stout.	4.75
700	Parabola	12oz bottle, Vintage 2019. It has been 10 years since I've had this one - way too long. Deep mahogany body is capped with a thin tan head. Big, rich, boozy aroma with oaky bourbon, roasted barley, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. On the palate, bold roasted malts and dark chocolate sweetness that lingers with notes of coffee, anise, bourbon, vanilla, oak, char, toasty grain, and bitter earthy hops. Mouth-feel is thick, smooth, and creamy; ample carbonation, alcohol burns the throat; finish is bitter with roast, anise, white pepper, and bitter hops. Just as good as I remember it being! I hope it doesn't take another decade to drink this again!	4.61
701	Parabola	"Just finished a bottle, fresh on my mind. This is a wonderful brew, a perfect compliment to a setting w a fire and friend or dog. I say that because you want to focus on this one.
Smell, taste is fantastic."	4.61
702	Parabola	"2019 Edition 12oz bottle.
L: Deep dark black, tan brown head and lively carbonation for a barrel aged beer.
S: Sweet bourbon, barrel, caramel, and boozy.
T: Coffee, dark malt, hazelnut, burnt toffee, lingering barrel, toasted, dry and bitter finish.
F: Small bite of heat. Drying bitterness lingers and boozy volatility builds.
O: Extremely enjoyable. This was my first ever Parabola and I think it has great potential to improve with time."	4.19
703	Parabola	Prefer this one to the 2018. Dark chocolate and coffee are the stars while the bourbon is pretty subdued. I would imagine if this was aged for at least a year, the bourbon and wood flavors would come out more. Perfect mouth feel. Extremely bitter which is the only flaw I can speak of.	4.47
704	Parabola	Exceptionally mellow for a 2019 vintage. Probably the thickest pour I’ve ever seen. It almost oozes ib the glass. Completely opaque with very little head. Boozy coffee on the nose. One of the booziest tasting stouts I’ve had. Lingering bitterness in the finish reminds me of espresso and dark chocolate. Not the most complex stout I’ve had but what there is is as good as it gets. And the more it warms the better it gets.	4.58
705	Parabola	10 oz. on tap.. Pours near-black with minimal tan head.. The nose and taste are an archetypal BBA stout. Chocolate, roast, caramel, and subtle smooth bourbon. Hints of raisin and cherry..  455 characters	4.4
706	Parabola	Look: Black and Tan, like the british shock troops.. Smell: If a bourbon aged beer could be brandy-aged, this would be that beer.. Taste: Alcohol is not hidden. Whiskey, maple syrup, molasses, roasted meat, herbs, a rich fire, game of thrones..  457 characters	4.4
707	Parabola	"fresh 2019 vintage, 12 oz bottle. 
pours jet black, with thick cream colored head that fades. very rich aroma of dark chocolate, some black cherry, a touch of smoke, caramel, vanilla. taste is similar. you get some of the bourbon barrel, and then the deep roasted malt flavors. thick bodied, very smooth. overall a top notch stout."	4.63
708	Parabola	2018. Pours black with a quarter inch mocha head that settled fairly quickly to a ring and left a couple spots of lacing. Smell is bourbon up front although not overpowering, cocoa, malts, oak, toffee and chocolate. Tastes of sweet bourbon, cocoa, milk chocolate, toffee, oak, vanilla, coffee, molasses, dark fruits and roasted malts. Full bodied, light carbonation, plush and creamy mouth feel. Awesome beer.	4.68
709	Parabola	Firestone Walker Parabola, 13% ABV. Pours black with a one-finger tan head that left some lacing. Nose is chocolate, roast malt, and bourbon. Taste follows, plus oak, moderate bitter close. Excellent mouthfeel. Overall outstanding, but a bit heavy on the roast malt and oak for my taste.	4.29
710	Parabola	Finally found this beer on tap at the giant eagle in waterworks got it for $7 for a 10 oz pour. Beer is the deepest dark blackness dense oily and thick with a half an inch of frothy head that fades to a very light ring. Smell is simple bittersweet cocoa some Bourbon and wood with a touch of molasses and toffee. Beer is rather sweet dense chocolate and molasses wood vanilla bourbon and finished with a bit of biiter hops. Body is as expected thick dense a real sipper.. Overall a bit too rich for another pour but totally worth trying. A real meal in a glass.	4.57
711	Parabola	Pretty far out of my comfort zone price wise, but I'll pony up once for a highly regarded classic. 2019 edition.. Gotta talk about the mouth feel first. It is incredibly full bodied and lush, best I've found in a BA beer. Upper echelon barrel treatment here, no doubt. More luscious, top shelf bourbon than wood or vanilla blotting out what is probably a stellar stout. I certainly don't regret the purchase, maybe even do it again sometime.	4.7
712	Parabola	2019 Edition, consumed 5/17/19. Pours deep, dark red/mahogany, black in the glass with a very small light tan head with med/low retention and a good amount of spotty lacing.. Aroma is primarily of the wonderfully sweet bourbon, perfectly melded with the stout notes of malts and cocoa..  550 characters	4.57
713	Parabola	2019 Edition.. L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a deep, dark, mahogany brown color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a half inch of foamy, tan-colored, somewhat long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.. S: A very enticing aroma of bourbon, malt, chocolate, wood, vanilla, dark fruit, and toffee..  759 characters	4.5
714	Parabola	"L - Oil. Pitch, opaque black with a tan head that dissipates quickly leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing.
S - Sweet chocolate, roasted malts, and rich bourbon - a little alcohol on the nose. Hints of toffee as well
T - Follows the nose: Sweet chocolate up front and throughout, roasted malts, oak, rich bourbon with slight alcohol warmth, toffee, vanilla, molasses.
F - Simply perfection when it comes to stouts. Thick, syrupy, smooth, soft, silky, velvety. Full bodied needless to say with minimal carbonation. One of the best mouthfeels I've ever had with a stout - I'd give it more points if I could.
O - This is a massive BBA stout - huge flavors and an absolutely decadent mouthfeel. Amazing."	4.72
715	Parabola	"There doesn't appear to be a date code on the bottle or label aside from the ""2019"" on the front.. Appearance: The beer pours very oily and black with an overall black appearance: The head is short and light khaki. There isn't much head retention or lacing, but there is a bit of a light khaki ring around the edges and a few bubbles.. Aroma: There is a light cocoa scent to the beer, which smells a bit like brownie batter and alcohol. It is appealing but not strong..  1,374 characters"	3.78
716	Parabola	Requires some months in the bottle to reduce the booziness, but then it's gold. Parabola represents the best of FW’s barrel aging program and is likewise the one first gone from shelves while the others sit around a bit longer.	4.48
717	Parabola	"12oz bottle. #10 vintage, 2019 dated. Packaged in an individual beer box.
Black colored body, with a very thin garnet back lit highlight. Less than a finger width of tan head, but this stays around as an active bubble fed island and ring. Leaves a few spots of lacing as they continue to slide down the glass.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, chocolate, bourbon barrel and vanilla.
Taste of dark roasted malts, chocolate, dry raisins, with a touch of vanilla and the bourbon barrel. The higher ABV% expresses with a dry finish and alcohol vapors in the nostrils. Coffee in the after taste, along with coconut as the beer warms.
Thicker mouth feel, with an after taste that expresses chocolate malted milk balls. Good carbonation.
The chocolate/vanilla mix really stands out, and the bourbon barrel brings the atmosphere. The dark fruit is so soaked with bourbon and wrapped in chocolate. More sweet than bitter, but well balanced throughout. Make this a sipping session so that the beer can reveal itself as it warms."	4.59
718	Parabola	"A brace (1 TUE & 1 today) of draught 8oz snifters at Wet City in Baltimore. Aged a year in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. MORE bourbon than the current ""batch"" of KBS - whether that's a good thing is obviously highly subjective."	4.36
719	Parabola	Pours black with a very nice brown head. Aromas of cream, wood, vanilla, whiskey and alcohol. The alcohol starts to game steam in the flavor of this one which is very stouts. Neither coffee nor chococolate dominates this one. Maybe some coffee roast on the retronasal. Some wood/whiskey. Smooth with light medium coronation. It's worth it. Just not mindblown.	4.38
720	Parabola	"100th review - a decent little start at least.
2019, another fantastic addition to my Parabola verticals - this is the beer that keeps on giving, year after year. Uniquely beautiful earth and fire dark garnet in color, perfectly clear and rather more transparent than you might expect. Wonderful rich nose with milk chocolate, dark chocolate, biscuity malts and espresso. If I would ever give any beer a 5/5 for anything (which I won’t), I’d give Parabola that perfect score for taste. If I could give it a 4.95 I would. It is so wonderfully deep and rich and delicate and complex, I can’t even really begin to describe it. Taste it for yourself. The mouthfeel is also world class, light and chewy at the same time. Just about as good as it gets.
So, this was so good I decided to pull a 2016 out of my cellar and try it against the fresh. Well, there just aren’t enough superlative adjectives in the English language to adequately describe this beer-drinking experience. I could resort to long strings of expletives, but that would be rather gauche. Suffice to say that everything great about the 2019 has improved markedly in the three-year-old version. Richer, more smoothly blended, better integrated ABV, more thunderously powerful, blow-your-socks-off intensity. Unbelievably wonderful. I’ve upped the numerical score to reflect this amazing beer’s potential for cellaring."	4.74
721	Parabola	2017 - dry, cocoa, toffee, burnt sugar brittle, charred wood.. 2018 - prune or plum, chocolate, caramel, less dry than the 2017, brighter.. 2019 - coffee, roast, the most acidic of the 3 for sure. Almost fizzy. Most malassas flavor.	4.64
722	Parabola	"LOOK - Pitch black in color - just a 1 finger head upon pour - nice foam ring continued on after the head receded
SMELL - Very aromatic - rich caramel, chocolate, coffee, booze - smells very sweet - some charred wood
TASTE - Strong rush of sweet chocolate syrup and caramel - strong alcohol blast comes in - some bitterness and charred wood come in next - dries out shortly thereafter and malty/caramel flavors remain
FEEL - very thick and rich - stays a bit carbonated which is a plus and rarity for a barrel aged beer
OVERALL - This is a very amazing beer - a slow sipper at ABV of 12.7% - this was a 2018 bottle (I wanted to wait a couple of years but just couldn't) I think I will start buying 1 a year and breaking one out after 3 years or so. I imagine the alcohol burn will mellow out with some time as this one is pretty hot and boozy - but still well balanced and very flavorful"	4.63
723	Parabola	The 2017 and the 2015 over the last year and while the 2017 was damn good, the '15 was revelatory! Both hit similar notes and have similar characteristics but the '15 is just..more so.. Dark brown color with a full head that quickly receives into a sturdy lacing. My God, that leasing is soft like a layer of foam on some fancy milk coffee beverage. Combined with the full body and gentle carbonation, this may be the softest beer I've ever felt past my lips and tongue. Drinking literally felt nice!. Chocolate fudge, rustic malts, tannic oak, and smooth bourbon flavor hit hard on the way down, and every belch tastes like licorice. This is a complex beer, and the dry to sweet ratio is perfectly balanced, as well balanced as every other aspect of the sphere. 17 tasted good but the 15 tastes like you're drinking something truly professional, and masterfully made. It certainly lives up to it classy label!.  1,026 characters	4.63
724	Parabola	2016 Vintage. Pours dark brown, not super thick. It smelled a bit musty with dark fruits. Taste was completely different: chocolate and charred barrel. Phenomenal beer!	4.38
725	Duck Duck Gooze	Foggy amber-orange with a fuzzy off-white head settling to a thin white film and bubbling surface with a fuzzy bumpy ring.. Smoothly tart green apple, lemon and grapefruit pair with a light sweetness from the red wine barrel, which also contributes a distinct red grape flavor.. The medium body is a little silky and lightly crisp, easily continuing to develop a mild but splintery neutral oak that brings out accents of apricot and toasted sesame before a lightly stinging semi-dry finish..  610 characters	4.23
726	Duck Duck Gooze	Vertical of 13' 16' 19'. 13 was the best with it's age, then 16 and 19. These guys are great with some age on them. Very distinct between the 3 . 13 is drinking great right now. 19 needs some time. 13 was definitely the best with it's Musty mustard seed funk. Still tart with light carbonation.	4.63
727	Duck Duck Gooze	2013 vintage; drank 11/20/14 @ California Split.. Murky tangerine color.. Minimal white head; minimal lace..  228 characters	3.9
728	Duck Duck Gooze	04/2016 - This is delicious. It's got a nose that reminds me a traditional gueuze, which rocks for a U.S.-based brewery, plus it has fruity, vinous notes abound!	4.64
729	Duck Duck Gooze	The beer pours a Clear gold with a medium frothy white head. It has high champagne like carbonation. The beer smells of lemon, cranberries, pears, hay, and damp funk. It tastes lightly tart, with cranberries, pears, red wine, hay, and damp funk. The feel is medium light, with some sweetness. This is an awesome beer, so complex and nuanced.	4.9
730	Duck Duck Gooze	When I took my first and only trip to Great American Beer Fest in 2017, I didn't know a lot about The Lost Abbey - I'd heard a few things about Veritas, and I'd tried a select few of their beers. I was a fan, but I didn't pursue their beer to the degree that I do now. I knew that Duck Duck Gooze was on the top 250 on Beer Advocate - but I never expected that I'd be able to try it.. Well now. I recently made a Facebook friend who used to live in San Diego but now lives and brews in northern Minnesota. Happy coincidence! He happens to love sours, just like I do... he helped me out with a bottle of Duck Duck Gooze (among other things) in our very first trade. I was thrilled, and still am - the beer is fantastic!. It's interesting to me how DDG differs from Belgian gueuze though - the characteristic funk seems to be entirely absent, and the nose doesn't pop to quite the same degree. It smells very nice, but it's a different sort of aroma - and taste. There's a bit of cheese to the taste, and a very light, clean, crisp sort of sour and tart character. Again, the Belgian funk is missing. Perhaps this has been lost with time, but it surprises me as older Belgian lambic still seems to retain that funk. There's also a marked lack of suspension - there's no noteworthy presence of fruit, yeast, or foreign matter of any kind. I don't mind that! I know some really enjoy that in Belgian lambic, but it's a happy absence as far as I'm concerned..  1,998 characters	4.71
731	Duck Duck Gooze	This beer is notorious in San Diego. Available every 3 years and each time, it creates more and more pandemonium. The most recent sale saw their website crash 3 times, people's orders get canceled and semi-anonymous social media postings containing every combination of swear words and off-color memes you can imagine.. But is it worth the hype?. Sort of. Its good, REALLY GOOD in fact. At $40 per bottle and potentially waiting in long lines to get it...well, you be the judge. I was able to score some with relative ease online but I dont think Id wait in an hours long line for it..  849 characters	4.37
732	Duck Duck Gooze	On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma has some sweet malt and fruity lambic notes. Taste is tart, fruity with floral yeast notes, some honey, clean malt and a hint of butterscotch. Really balanced and tasty.	4.5
733	Duck Duck Gooze	"2013. A- Straw yellow/orange
S- Tart and a bit of funk
T- Very tart, tons of lemon... maybe a bit of stone fruit
F- A bit more syrupy than the Fou I was also tasting
O- Very good wild ale"	4.47
734	Duck Duck Gooze	This one pours a darkish orange, with a small head and a good bit of lacing.. This smells like super lemony acidity, mineral mustiness, lemongrass, dry hay, stone fruit, and lots of earthy funk.. The taste is similar and incredibly complex. There's a ton of incredibly sour lemon acidity, with a deep and complex funk that feels like lemongrass, hay, chalky minerals, wet oak, and light wine..  588 characters	4.76
735	Duck Duck Gooze	Pours a beautiful deeper yellow with fluffy white head that is almost sustained by the influx of bubbles from beneath. Funk funk funk on the nose, with a kiss of sweet. There is an initial sweet, that then spreads out into a more earthy flavor, that evolves into a tart finish, with a slight acidic reaction from the 'ol personal heartburn detector. Very good take on the style.	4.68
736	Duck Duck Gooze	"2016 Vintage poured into a teku:. Cloudy straw-yellow slightly orange pour with small head and constant champagne like carb bubbles rising
Smells a bit like vermouth, some sour/acetic tones, grape, flowery, herbally
WOW, the flavors are incredibly complex floral tones that fade into sour, horse blanket body and finishes like a dry wine
I have to give the feel some love here, the carb is perfect for the style and definitely helps to highlight some of the subtleties"	4.71
737	Duck Duck Gooze	For purposes of this review, 2013 was compared side-by-side to 2016.. Appearance- The beer was a bright straw yellow with a bright white head.. Smell - The sour meshes with the oak..  632 characters	4.68
738	Duck Duck Gooze	"**REVIEW NUMBER 1,000**
:and also:
**BEER ADVOCATE BEER NUMBER 1,600**. Thanks to eyebereej for sending this bottle!
2013 bottling. Consumed on Dec. 18, 2016; reviewed from notes. Poured from the 750 mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel Aged glass.. A: Pours a hazy, glowing gold. Forms a thin white head that fades quickly with a relatively low amount of visible carbonation. This isn't bad-looking by any stretch, but appears fairly still. I don't know if that's a consequence of aging or not..  1,690 characters"	4.66
739	Duck Duck Gooze	"Did a side-by-side tasting with DDG, Allagash Coolship Resurgam and Jester King Spon Methode Gueze as part of our annual Xmas eve tasting.
DDG was universally agreed to be third in the group and Resurgam remains, hands down, the best gueze-like American beer and the only one that can go head-to-head with the likes of Cantillon, Drie, and Tilquin.. DDG was good, not great.
It was, visually, quite lovely. The aroma, however, prominently featured an off-putting porta-potty characteristic that very much distracted from the more pleasant funk and citrus fruity esters.. Fortunately, not much of off-putting aroma carried over to the flavor. However, it was a touch sweeter than I'd expect for the style and it seemed that a bit of wine flavor from the barrels came through in the beer-not a bad thing per se but not really appropriate for a gueze style beer..  960 characters"	3.83
740	Duck Duck Gooze	Bottle pour at 2016 O’Brien’s SDBW Lost Abbey Beer Dinner.. A: Pours pale straw colored with a half inch of foamy head.. S: Off dry, light brett character (horseblanket, earth), soft fruit (pineapple, orange, candied tangerine), some supporting vanilla and oak. Balance is towards the brett..  567 characters	4.62
741	Duck Duck Gooze	"A: Straw with some lovely effervescence. Nice white head that sticks around.
S: Lemon zest, some green apple, wet hay, touch of oak barrel and a little white wine.
T: Similar to the smell, funky and fruity with a touch of oak.
M: This is where this beer really shines. Super soft and champagne like.
O: This beer is wonderful. The smell brings you in and the finish makes you wanting more. Tart up front with that soft, dry finish...crazy good stuff"	4.57
742	Duck Duck Gooze	2016 batch drank in a teku on 10/5/2016. A nice refreshing crisp sour/gueuze. Certainly one of the better gueuze that I have had. Lemony tartness is present and balanced. Not too tart. The red wine barrels definitely are prevalent with a little boozy and nice oaky presence. Glad I can finally cross this one off the list! Very tasty and worth pursuing	4.5
743	Duck Duck Gooze	Outstanding! I'm still not 100% aboard the sour train, but this is definitely a strong push in the right direction. I enjoyed batch 2 over the weekend with a friend and he gave it even higher marks than me. Wish they brewed it a little bit more often though..	4.69
744	Duck Duck Gooze	"Previous review is for the 2009, it was a 4.5. I remember it being very sour, I had it in 2011. anxious to see how it is fresh. looks fantastic and smells great! nice funky and sour up front on the nose.
taste is a bit sour and some nice sweetness. great oak. beer is full bodied for a 7%er.
overall this a good beer, but don't make my mistake. give this a year or 2 to pucker up and get funky like the nose, right now it's a bit too young. I'll bet the 2013 is drinking fantastic right now."	4.33
745	Duck Duck Gooze	2013 poured into a snifter. Pours golden with little head. Smells of white grapes and dry red wine. Light bodied busting with grapes and pear as the carbonation wiskes across the tongue. This beer finishes with a little funk, barrel and mild acidity. Overall this beer is a true art form. A must have for gueze and wild ale lovers alike.	4.91
746	Duck Duck Gooze	Duck duck gooze batch 2. Pours a hazy amber-yellow color with a small, fizzy white head, which leaves back no trace.. Smell is old potatoes, glue, blue cheese, bright and crisp citrus peel with a soft, flowery note to it and a slightly acetic tartness. Very well balanced, not pungently sour, while producing a nice, funky blend. Got some wet hay on top of its aroma foundation with dried tomatoe bush, adding a light herbal complexity to the nose..  1,574 characters	4.42
747	Duck Duck Gooze	2013, poured into a teku.. Pours a slightly hazy orange-light amber in color, with a minimal-to-no foam head upon pour. Smells of a rich, fruity farmhouse-wild ale with a mild funk note. Taste has loads of sour green apples, with some pear and very small amount of lemon like taste. Clean, crisp end which is quite easy to drink and imploring you to go back to continue sipping. Despite the clean and crisp end, the sour green apple flavor lingers long after the drink in a pleasant way.. Quite a wild ale. Would love to be able to drink this on a more frequent basis and get a taste of the '16 version. However, the feeding frenzy around each release and the steep asking price for trading makes this virtually impossible. Russian River sours remind me of DDG, and for the time being those are going to be the ones I will seek out until DDG becomes easier to obtain.	4.63
748	Duck Duck Gooze	Bottle from Toby, 2013 vintage. As usual when the Boise crew gets together, sours dominate, but they’re always top notch. Here’s yet another great example, light bodied, tart, fruity and funky. Tasty stuff.	4.24
749	Duck Duck Gooze	Pours darker than I expected. The color is similar to apple juice with a ring of bubbles on the edge of the glass. Aroma is bursting with fruit - apple, pear, apricot, peach, and white wine. Oak and soft funk also comes through. Strong flavors on the taste. Everything comes through so balanced and well integrated. I get tons of vanilla as well. There is a soft funk in the background - wet hay, barnyard, some band aid. It's there, but the fruit is still center stage. The flavors are bright and vibrant, but they don't fall off quickly either. Complex, intense. This is the best beer I've had to date.	4.91
750	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	2014 vintage; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Black/brown appearance.. Minimal dark khaki head; no lace..  346 characters	4.42
751	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Had a cellared bottle. Been hunting this one for awhile, and it did not disappoint! Smell has rich bourbon barrel character that compliments all flavors. The booze, wood, coffee, chocolate, slight vanilla, licorice, leather and charcoal in the smell. Taste is much the same, woven together in rich creamy layers. Add some earthiness, dark fruit, and molasses, and notice the depth of the coffee flavors, and the taste is complete. Feel is creamy, super rich, the right amount of booziness, and chewy.	4.75
752	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Tasted from bottle. Pours black with tan head. Huge coffee aroma with some bourbon. Taste is thick and chewy. No booziness to it. Flavors of caramel, molasses, coffee, cocoa, bourbon. Dangerously drinkable.	4.83
753	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	2014 bottle poured into a KBBS teku on 3-16-19. I'm thankful that this aged so well. I'm sure the coffee flavor has subsided a little from its original flavor, but to me that is a positive. This beer is excellent.	4.75
754	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	2016 bottle - wish I would have drank it fresh. It’s not bad, but there’s very little on the seeet side to balance out a pretty intense coffee flavor.. Checks all the boxes, but sadly there are comparable beers I can grab on the shelf.	4.33
755	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Pours black with a finger and a half of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is sweet bourbon over medium-roast, medium-bodied coffee. Toffee and molasses each add a little sweetness, with hearty roasty and toasty malts forming the base. It's all led by sweet bourbon. Flavor profile is bourbon, chocolate, molasses, toffee and medium-roast coffee, with roasty and toasty malts. There is a kiss of char at the back, but otherwise, the heat from the alcohol and bourbon are low. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety texture that is broken up by a hot, grainy texture. Overall, a huge and superb stout wedded with notable bourbon and flavorful coffee.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.	4.69
756	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Traded in NC for a bottle. No visible date. Look- Poured into a tulip. A thin brownish-tan head which faded quickly. The little lacing and some stickiness in places.. Smell- Lots of caramel, chocolate, and vanilla. I was expecting more coffee and the barrel, but it just was not there. The smell was fantastic either way..  659 characters	4.75
757	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	03/2017 - dig the vanilla, fruity aromas that dominate up front, plus some coffee; the palate is chock full of nice barrel, plus some more vanilla, coffee, and dark chocolate; the body is quite enjoyable, but the finish is a bit tannic amidst all those other great qualities.	4.35
758	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	"Extremely amazing beer.
Smell of caramel
Taste of chocolate and coffee
Overall very drinkable for a 12% ABV. Coffee everpresent, but not overpowering."	4.73
759	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2016 vintage.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a fat mocha head that fades to leave a creamy blanket and and light lacing.. S - Big aromas of fudgy chocolate brownies, caramel, bourbon juice, nutty notes. The coffee is really faint but all other notes are super pleasant..  825 characters	4.64
760	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Another big thanks to rudzud, 2016. Again pours a giant frothy creamy thick heavy 3 finger dark colored heavy thick head, fades slowly, nice thick soapy dark lacing, pitch black beer and looooong legs, couldn't be better than this. Nose loads of dark chocolate and coffee, earthy caramel like coffee, a bit sweet caramel toffee, with nice nougat chocolate fudge, nice mild earthy coffee and chocolate coffee notes, but loads of the base beer, dark chocolate, some roast, loads of vanilla and vanilla ice cream, baker's chocolate cocoa with a little generic back end fresh coffee, little caramel and vanilla toasted oak barrel, flashes of coconut barrel too, and a bit of sweet bourbon, great beer but coffee is lighter than it should be, probably age.  1,417 characters	4.66
761	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Black color with brownish head. Aroma is a bit spicy with chocolate notes, bourbon and some booze. Taste has roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, bourbon in the background. Medium plus body with soft carbonation. Overall it's a really nice, well rounded imperial coffee stout.	4.65
762	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Had a pour at Dark Lord day and it was pretty good. Not long before I had BA abraxis and BA darkness, both were better. To me this beer should not be ranked this high	4.2
763	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Had at a bottleshare. Wish I knew who brought it, so I could thank them. It was a standout among greats. Thick, rich, black blood of the Earth. Thanks whoever!	5
764	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Rich, smooth texture. Slight but not overpowering bourbon scent and taste. Not so boozy as to take away from the stout richness. Great chocolate left on the back.	4.98
765	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Probably my favorite the Speedway coffee variants.. The beer pours a blackish brown color with pretty good head retention and lacing. The beer looks rich and viscous, which it ain't no bad thing. On the nose, there is considerable coffee and vanilla, along with underlying dark chocolate and perhaps a hint of cinnamon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and while this stout is pretty sweet, the coffee flavor seems to balance and counter that sweetness somewhat. There's a mocha quality on the palate of this beer that I just love. Mouthfeel is full, soft and fairly creamy, with a very long finish. Alcohol is incredibly well integrated into the flavor profile, and so drinkability is terrific (almost too terrific, as it's hard to show restraint where this beer is concerned).. Just outstanding, and a beer I order and even make a special trip to obtain, whenever I see it on tap around Portland.	4.51
766	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Pitch black pour, smaller tan head. Gobs of lace. Aroma of rich coffee, roasted malt, whiskey, fudge. Taste is nearly indescribable.... Fudge brownie, light bourbon, rich, freshly roasted and ground coffee, wood, light chestnut. Thick full body, oily mouthfeel, and not boozy in the least bit. Incredible!	4.71
767	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	This was my unicorn beer for a long time, I probably had unrealistic expectations going into this, but for me, while a very good beer, it did not live up to the hype or the price	4.5
768	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	I have no idea why but this tastes like a lightly toasted Marshmallow. So good and so not what I expected it to taste like. A must have beer for any stout lover and worthy of its acclaim.	4.83
769	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Viscous black under a mocha blanket that settles to a thick collar.. The distinct aroma of roasted, waxy walnuts hits me first, which is quickly enveloped by decadence: chocolate, peanut butter fudge, and pie crust. Then wet, dark wood and a touch of wafer mix in.. The first sip starts sticky with flavors of vanilla rum on the lips, transitioning to nutty chocolate fudge and syrup on the palate. Brittle toffee and deep luscious mocha are spiked with measured bourbon that provides sophisticated notes of smoke and char..  597 characters	4.48
770	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Black with off white foam.. Sharp, sweet bourbon.. Coffee curbs the heat from the alcohol but not quite enough. Mix of earthy and sweet, the later from vanilla and booze as I can't pick out chocolate. Apparent alcohol's not always a turn off but this doesn't strike the right balance for me..  316 characters	4
771	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	"Look is black
Smell is figgy with coco and coffee coming through
Taste is amazing! Nuttiness, slight tart, and tons of coco and coffee. The bourbon comes through with the perfect balance
Overall, amazing beer"	4.86
772	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Just like cold brew with lots of chocolate and vanilla. Mouth feel is silky and substantial. Excellent barrel character with toffee and butterscotch without the alcohol burn. No bitterness from the coffee. Easy drinking and we'll worth seeking out.	4.71
773	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	A sexy beast. Poured pitch black; not much different then their other stouts. The aroma is outstanding. All coffee - it contributes strong notes of hazelnuts. There is trace notes of bourbon which adds the complexity to the coffee. Smells sweet and dessert-like, like Tirimisu. Upon sipping, the coffee is exactly like the aroma. Full-blown hazelnuts with trace bourbon. I admit I never tasted coffee like this in any other stouts. The coffee adds so much flavor yet I appreciate its simplicity as the hazelnuts are so easy to pick up. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and rich. Outstanding beer, well crafted!	4.72
774	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged	Wow, just simply wow. Had this even after a full line up of BA stouts and getting to palate fatigue this one stood out. Great coffee nose like a true Caffe de Monde Vietnamese coffee complete with evaporated milk thick creaminess. For those who know what a vietnamese coffee is can relate to what this means. Just super coffee and bourbon forward yet balanced and full mouth creamy feel. Simple Superb!	4.69
775	Morning Wood	"Impenetrable black pour with a half finger of tan head. Full ring of carbonation and curtains of lacing remain
Maple, smoky bacon, cocoa, coffee, caramel aromas all are strong
Maple, bacon, cherry, fig, cocoa, coconut flavors. Slight char and brown sugar.
Full bodied, coats the tongue, slight hop bitterness with flavors opening across the tongue and as the glass warms. Bacon and coffee aftertaste. Stubborn carbonation. No alcohol burn, just slight heat.
Maple bacon coffee porter? Mission accomplished."	4.72
776	Morning Wood	Pours a jet black. Aroma is wonderful mix of bourbon, maple, coffee & caramel. Very pleasant. I lingered over the smell much more than usual. The taste was equally pleasing and quite complex. It comes at you in waves. Starting with the sweet maple with brown sugar, caramel & chocolate, and then shifting to a more roasted flavor to go with the coffee. All the while a constant bourbon flavor. Simply awesome. Medium to full body.	4.75
777	Morning Wood	Let’s have maple syrup, coffee, bacon and bourbon for breakfast in the middle of the night. It’s the life of the craft beer affecianado. Big thanks to @Roguer for knocking down this long time want. Hits all the notes and then some. Delicious brew and I’ll have to strum up another to share after bogarting this one all to myself.	4.71
778	Morning Wood	L - 1-finger dense hazelnut head never fully recedes, leaving behind a fuzzy layer atop a pitch black body.. S - strong maple, a hint of bacon, and lots of bourbon.. T - follows the nose. Sweet bourbon, wood char, salt, maple, a little coffee. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate-low booziness..  408 characters	4.5
779	Morning Wood	Black in color with no penetration to light and a fingernail of brown the rim. The aroma is of maple syrup, bourbon, and coffee. I’m tasting coffee, maple syrup, and bourbon. The whole thing is sweet, but with a quick lightly bitter finish. The mouth is lightly chewy and sticky.	4.29
780	Morning Wood	Poured jet black with a thin mocha head. The smell of coffee, maple and caramel flood the nose. The taste of the beer has a nice sweet chocolate/maple flavor with a subtle coffee finish. The feel is silky smooth, finishes dry and a little warming. Overall it’s an outstanding beer!	4.64
781	Morning Wood	Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out as black as night and forms a pinky worth of tightly packed, peanut butter fudge colored bubbles to rest on top as a crown. 4.25. The nose brings a plethora of different layers; creamy coffee, semi sweet chocolate, maple sweetness, burnt brown sugar and slightly toasted coconut on the backend, all resting on top of a smokey/salty base. The barrel is detectable through some very slight dry oak notes. 4.5. The taste comes in with sweet maple before melding into slightly roasty, creamy coffee notes. The smokey/salty layers are still present, tangling with brown sugar and semisweet chocolate. It makes me think of coating maple bacon strips with brown sugar, putting them in the oven, and then pulling them out and drizzling them with chocolate, all while you are enjoying your morning coffee. The barrel is very slightly present, offering just a touch of dry oak and a kiss of dark fruit at the very end. If you weren’t searching for it, you might not even guess it was there. 4.75.  1,583 characters	4.59
782	Morning Wood	Scored a bomber at Total wine in Royal Palm , FLA. Black liquid crowned by a two finger creamy brown foam cap, quickly recedes , brown ring, few lacings. Aroma is maple, bourbon, sweet, roasted malts, tobacco, slight smokiness.  385 characters	4.65
783	Morning Wood	2018 vintage; drank 4/5/19 @ Yuss Haus Mach III.. This was a total maple bomb, with some nice chocolate undertones. It's not subtle, and if you don't like maple you should avoid at all costs...but I found it enjoyable. I'd have another!	3.92
784	Morning Wood	Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, oak, and roasty and toasty malts. Very deep aroma with a springy sweetness. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty and caramely malts and medium-roast coffee, chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, toffee and caramel. A touch of bourbon and its heat and woody oak balances out the sweetness a little. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a very smooth and lightly creamy texture. It's thickness and consistency is medium-thick. Overall, maple syrup and coffee is huge and pairs well with bourbon. Heat is minimal, especially when considering the 11% ABV.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 22oz bottle.	4.4
785	Morning Wood	"Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy head. Smell is quite sweet and dominated by maple syrup, with hints of lightly roasted, caramel malt and chocolate, coffee and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose, being quite sweet and absolutely dominated by maple syrup and caramel, lightly roasted malt, with lighter notes of coffee, chocolateand lovely vanilla bourbon notes, as well as a certain earthy, woody oak presence. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and an almost cloying maple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. Thick mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.. While this is a really nice stout, it's still highly overrated in my personal opinion, due to a poor balance that heavily favors an intense maple sweetness that almost drowns out most of the other flavors, while there really isn't that much coffee to it either. Its one saving grace are some lovely bourbon and oak notes that both complement the flavor profile while at the same time adding some much needed depth. I'm certainly not getting any ""salty bacon"" from this either. Certainly enjoyable, but far from world-class in my personal opinion, although this may also be due to the bottle being already 18 months old when I had it. I could imagine the coffee being more intense and creating a better balance against the maple when this is fresh."	4.15
786	Morning Wood	Look: Pitch black, like oil coming out of the bottle. A finger of very dark brown head resembling chocolate milk.. Smell: Maple syrup and milk chocolate.. Taste: Strong maple syrup undercut by a small amount of roast bitterness and a doughy malt aftertaste. Sweet, but not cloying..  449 characters	4.6
787	Morning Wood	L: Poured from a growler to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of creamy, tan-colored, long-lasting head. Very good lacing.. S: An incredibly enticing aroma of maple syrup, malt, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate.. T: Tasted of a bit of malt (not a huge factor), a good shot of bourbon (and its accompanying barrel), a hint of vanilla, a ton of maple syrup (quite sweet), a bit of chocolate, and some coffee. This is a rich, sweet, terribly well-balanced flavor. The maple syrup is definitely the dominant force, but it's never cloying. Tasty stuff..  739 characters	4.5
788	Morning Wood	Rated as 2017. Waited too long. Smell is still there. Although the taste is not. It is not a bad beer by any means, just missed out on drinking it fresh.	4.3
789	Morning Wood	A bomber bottle with no date visible poured into a snifter.. Look- Thick dark black with a thin brownish head. Nice thin lacing that sticks a little.. Smell- Very complex smell. Starts with a strong aroma of maple syrup and chocolate. As it warmed, the barrel and coffee start to kick in slightly but not what I expected..  777 characters	4.74
790	Morning Wood	Appearance - The beer was a murky black color with a mocha colored head.. Smell - The nose was super sweet with notes of bourbon and maple.. Taste - At the front, my first impression was that I was drinking super sweet coffee. The maple notes largely overpowered the coffee. The stickiness of the maple hid the bourbon notes and any sense of alcohol..  525 characters	4.31
791	Morning Wood	"On tap:
Opaque black body supporting a creamy and regenerative brown head. Lacing is sparse, but there are some oily legs.. Nose is mostly chocolate and maple, the barrel and coffee being mostly buried by these notes.. Taste isn’t as sweet as the nose’s chocolate impression might indicate. The coffee isn’t prominent but sneaks in back of the fairly sweet opening. There’s an ever so slight nod to the bacon mid-taste, but the chicory-like base strains to support the maple and vanilla..  711 characters"	4.46
792	Morning Wood	"A-Beer pours a nice black color with a generous tan head and slight lacing
A-Aroma has generous maple syrup hints
T-Taste follows the nose with a wonderful maple syrup flavor
M-A medium bodied beer with generous carbonation
O-An exceptional, very well made beer"	5
793	Morning Wood	Overly hyped. Way too sweet, all I tasted was maple syrup and lactose. Tons of vanilla make this beer hard to drink. Not impressed when Goose Island BCBS is available in Florida on tap at local brew pubs.	3.61
794	Morning Wood	Poured a black body with no head and almost no khaki lace, either (quite thick). The aroma has a touch of wood and coffee but mostly I pick up maple syrup. Thick body but not sticky/cloying thick, the maple syrup is dominant flavor although one could say there is a buttery taste from the barrels (hint of vanilla sweetness) and touch of bacon. Don't really pick up any coffee notes as to me the beer is more sweet and woody, although I also don't pick up any booze and this is mostly a sweet dessert beer to me.	4.18
795	Morning Wood	"Pours quite dark with a nice mocha head. Aroma is heavy maple syrup with intermingled coffee. Very nice chocolate flavor that is swiftly overcome by the maple syrup, coffee is in the background and is perfectly balanced in the mix. Quite sweet. Barrel aging is not as dominant as I like from this brewery (thinking Last Buffalo in the Park). A bit overcarbonated IMO. Overall definitely worth a try, not worthy of the BA #33 ranking., but definitely a top 100.. 11/21/18
Bomber, 2018 vintage
4.25 rating"	4.29
796	Morning Wood	22 oz bottle poured into highball glass I do believe it is the 2018 series.. A: Not much of a Head but it was poured fairly cold. The body is a rich black color.. S: Lots of Maple on the nose and some coffee. If the bourbon is there it is hard to detect..  703 characters	3.98
797	Morning Wood	Morning wood bottled 10/17. Pours black, mocha head dissipates to film of large and medium bubbles. nose is maple, vanilla, coffee, caramel. Taste is chocolate, coffee, almond. Finish is caramel, whiskey, maple, smoke. Medium, soft mouthfeel. No heat. This is more bitter and smokey than I expected. Maybe this is on me for losing track of it in the cellar. The nose is great, though mouthfeel is a bit thin.	3.84
798	Morning Wood	"Bottle shared by Chalumeaux, thanks for sharing and for opening your home to me!
Sweet a little sticky with lots of maple and lightly peppery coffee. Hints of warming alcohol. Light oaky spice. Very tasty beer but pales in comparison to the last buffalo in the park."	4
799	Morning Wood	3000th Review!. A - Pours sludgy black and opaque. Small bubbles on a mocha head of one finger. Minimal head retention but good boozy, spotty lace.. S - Baileys, Kahlua, maple, chocolate, licorice, wood, sweet milky chocolate..  688 characters	4.21
800	Lou Pepe - Kriek	On tap at Moeder Lambic, first one in a lambic glass, second in a tulip. Deep red with virtually no head. Mild cherry and lambic smell. Taste has a nice complexity that stands out even in the middle of a Zwanze day’s worth of cantillon. A real treat.	4.75
801	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Carnivale Brettanomyces 2019. Small size sample from bottle in de Bierkoning, Amsterdam, poured by the man himself: Jean Van Roy. 2014 label, bottles 2016. Pours a lovely deep red/purple-ish colour, slightly hazy, and a dense pink head with good retention. Aroma's of cherries and almonds/fruitstones, sour & sweetish. No sweetness retronasal. Flavour is sour, with light dry bitterness. Light bodied. Long finish, tart and dry.	3.97
802	Lou Pepe - Kriek	From bottle at brewery. Beautiful Ruby appearance with a dense pale pink head that retains and laces far better than I've ever seen for the style. Smells like cherry pie filling. Flavors strike a wonderful balance between a gentle graininess, tart cherry, and bretty funkiness. Amazing complexity with a nice drying finish that tapers off quickly. Pricey but understandably so. 92/100	4.59
803	Lou Pepe - Kriek	05/2016 - this is fucking incredible. Cinnamon, tart acidic cherries; slightly sweet, very fruit, and only a light amount of acidity; great funk, oak, and barnyard in back; clean and delightful.	4.65
804	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Very drinkable at 5% ABV. Taste of multiple types of fruit. very limited availability in the USA, but for the high price would recommend other lambic beers as an alternative. Either way, solid offering if you can get it.	4.65
805	Lou Pepe - Kriek	2012 bottled 2014, pour to snifter, purple, fine pinkish head, small head and slight lacing. Complex nose combines cherry with funk. Taste primarily sour cherry that is well balanced, not too sour or funky. Very dry and high carbonation.	4.66
806	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"2008 sticker poured into Cantillon stem.
Deep red in appearance. Barely any head. Looks like Juice.
Smells like a funky cherry pie in a good way. Tons of cherry and that’s typical Cantillon funk.
Taste is amazing. SO much cherry with slight funk. Really delicious.
Feel was as expected. Proper body and nice carb. Very drinkable.
Overall, this beer wasn’t outstanding. So balanced and held up so well for it being a 2008."	4.94
807	Lou Pepe - Kriek	2014 vintage poured from bottle at Cantillon in August 2017. Pours a nice purple with light purple head that quickly dissipates. Beautiful beer. Nose is woody, tons of sour cherries, earthy, and a bit viney. Taste is so smooth. Not much sourness, but a lot of cherries! I wouldn't call this an overly complex beer, but super tasty and smooth. Mouthfeel is perfect.	4.18
808	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"2017-08-22
2014 bottle split between four people at the Cantillon tasting room after the tour.. Pours a pretty dark red with a pink head. Smells like cherry -- lots of cherry, with something of a jam character.. Taste is cherry and tartness -- interesting that the aroma seemed fairly sweet, but the taste is not. There's a slight bitterness to it that complements surprisingly nicely..  517 characters"	4.8
809	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Lou Pepe Kriek 14 from bottle, at Cantillon Brewery in Brussels, Belgium.. A deep clear, red appearance with abundant amount of light foam upon pour. Smell has an abundance of strong cherry aroma combined with some well balanced barnyard funk and wheat smell. Very complex taste. Some 'farm' flavors such as light cheese and wheat and big cherry flavors (but not overly sweet). Smooth aftertaste and sipper for sure.	4.7
810	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Cherry red with a touch of amber, lots of carbonation, a hint of haze, and a finger of Pepto Bismol pink head.. Smells acidic and fruity, of vinegar, cherries, spices . Notes of cloves and nutmeg, deep, cellar like funk, and dusty attic, just like the Cantillon Brewery where I purchased this masterpiece at the end of 2013.. Sour, dry and fruity. Very acidic but with a softness that makes it non abrasive. The essence of cherries and red fruits are in there, along with the breweries classic funk and cellar and dust. Cobwebs come to mind, and macaroni. Floral notes are also present..  1,016 characters	4.59
811	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"I am drinking a bottle brewed in 2008 and packaged in 2010.
L: foams up like champagne with a pink tinted cap that dissipates almost as soon as it forms. The hazy pinkish red liquid demonstrates it effervescence with as torrents of tiny bubbles rush to the surface, producing a continuous soft hiss.. S: Despite its age, which can diminish a fruit lambic's aromas, the cherries in this beer hit the nose from over 3 feet away. Closer up detects sour aromas, light funk, traces of wet horse blanket and a hint of red wine and oak.. T: Big, tart cherry flavors dominate the palate joined by traces of diacetyl, wheat, vanilla, and wine remind me of a fresh cherry tart. the flavors are intense, well balanced and complex..  837 characters"	5
812	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"Rating is for 2013 Vintage:
Pours deep ruby with pink head.
Aroma has lot of cherries, lemon, tart, sour
Taste is sour cherries, lemon tart, sweet cherry jam, little funk, dusty, oak.. 
Review for 2007 vintage:
Pours ruby, not as deep as 2013, with slightly pink head.
Aroma has lots of dusty cellar, tart, barnyard, red berries, funky.
Taste is a lot like the aroma, more sweetness than the aroma, red berries, barnyard, jam.
L: 4.75 S: 4.5 T: 4.5 F: 4.5 O: 4.5"	5
813	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"My favorite of the Lou Pepe series. Beautiful color and a tremendous sour cherry flavor. Not quite as rich as the Hanssen's
Oude Schaarbeekse Kriek nor as tart as LPF (different fruit but naturally draws the comparison), this beer provides a wonderful balance between funk and fruit. A real treat that I hope to drink again sometime in the not-so-distant future."	4.56
814	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Was surprised to be able to find a 2012 750ml that could be consumed on site at Hill Farmstead. Beer is a murky ruby red in glass with pick 2 finger head. Aroma is a blend of sweet fruits and earthy funkiness that blends really nicely together. Taste is amazing. A perfectly blended mix of all the good things I like in a Belgian Lambic/sour and done better than most any I've had to date. It's only slightly sour, mixed with tartness and sweetness from the fruit, but finishes so clean. No syrupy sweetness on the back of the tongue like you get from some other fruit beers. It was quite the highlight of my Vermont trip to finally get to sample something from Cantillon and if I can't have it at the source in Belgium, then sitting at Hill Farmstead on a 75 degree sunny fall day sure isn't too shabby a venue either.	5
815	Lou Pepe - Kriek	A 750ml bottle at the brewery. 2013 sticker, bottled on 10th September 2015. Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass.. Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy dark ruby red with a three finger dark pink head and sparse lacing.. Aroma: Marzipan, cherry and almonds dominate with hints of biscuit. Only some light sour tartness..  731 characters	4.73
816	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"The perfect cherry lambic. The best way to describe this beer is ""Delicate"". It has the perfect mouthfeel and the delicate and perfect balance of cherry flavors, tartness and acidity. Can't do any better for a cherry beer."	4.9
817	Lou Pepe - Kriek	750ml poured into a teku at 2017 KBBS share in Lincoln, Nebraska.. Appearance - Burgandy.. Smell - Funky cherry pie!.  306 characters	5
818	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Gorgeous to look at, and almost just as good to drink. I found the cherries to be even a little bit sweet to help combat the sour tartness, which I loved. Still can't decide if I like this or the LP Framboise better...	4.52
819	Lou Pepe - Kriek	2012 sticker with a 2014 cork drank on 7/14/2016. L-thin but small pink head after a lot of foam disappeared quickly after pouring. dark almost ruby red. S-funky, acidic, heavy cherry and oak.  540 characters	4.8
820	Lou Pepe - Kriek	2012. L: Pours a beautiful deep cloudy red. S: Smells strongly of cherries, red wine notes and oak.  332 characters	5
821	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Vintage 2006. Opened in 2016 as a toast to friendship and craft beer.. L: Red wine lipstick crimson on the body with heated Jell-O colored foam on the pour.. S: Predominantly red wine and oak, with bits of earthy funk and muted fruit lingering on the nose. As the beer warms, the aromas open up, highlighting a wonderful blend of vinous cherry notes that take over the olfactory senses..  1,027 characters	4.85
822	Lou Pepe - Kriek	Lp kriek '13 vintage. Pours a vibrant ember to lilac color with a fizzy, bubbly head, leaving back a thick film of lacing at the rim of the glass.. Dusty, leather accompanied, funky cherry from the very first smell. Produces a ripe, dark sour cherry impression, while ensuring an intriguing complexity, due to wood bark, dried oak and heated cherry pit among a fermented tartness..  1,099 characters	4.49
823	Lou Pepe - Kriek	My favorite of the Cantillon products I've had. Such a fantastic beer! So much cherry flavor, much much more than the standard kriek. Bummed that they didn't have any for sale to take home.	4.94
824	Lou Pepe - Kriek	"Man this is some super thick red, a mix of pink on the top, red, deep red throughout, this was the precursor to 3f making intense red, same style of kriek on roids kind of vibe. Aroma is just of fresh crushed cherries and plenty of spontaneous sourness with oak.. 
Wow, this is a more substantial and darker cherry vibe than the regular kriek. MOAR cherry in this one. Lots of thickness and viscosity, I love it."	4.75
825	Zombie Dust	"Thanks to JohnnyHopps for fresh can.
Nice copper coloring. Thick head with some lace.
Mostly hop smells. Citrusy resiny.
Taste is great. Full bodied. Plenty of west coast style hop taste at beginning and finishing with a very dry almost soapy finish. Has a great malt base though that really masked it stand out as a balanced pale ale."	4.18
826	Zombie Dust	12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 09/30/19, so a month old. Beer #1500, APA #100, and it's Halloween, so what better drink for the occasion than Zombie Dust.. Looks great in the glass, golden yellow body with hints of amber. Generous white head dissipates to a solid covering, but retains thanks to fast streams of carbonation. Great lacing.. Hoppy aroma, a little on the dank side. Light touches of both citrus and non citrus fruit..  897 characters	4.36
827	Zombie Dust	"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip pint.. Appearance
Golden blonde. Good clarity. Light carbonation. Short white cap.. Nose
Candied orange, lemon, grapefruit, and mango..  490 characters"	4.29
828	Zombie Dust	"Amazing beer. Definitely the best APA I've ever had.
Very smooth, very good flavor profile.. If you ever come across it, buy as much as you can. It's very sought after & hard to find packaged."	4.83
829	Zombie Dust	Waited to try this beer for years and then kind of forgot about it. Suddenly it appears on local shelves. It is pretty good for only having the terrible Citra hop being used (I am sorry but Psuedo Sue is terrible). I would describe this as the original juicy pale ale before the haze craze came along. It also has the benefit of having bitterness and not being overly sweet. Would I drink this regularly? Probably not as I am more in the pine, herbal, earthy, dank spectrum with hoppy beers.	4.04
830	Zombie Dust	Long time favorite. Once almost impossible to get. A well balanced pale /IPA. A bit hazy, juicy but balanced out with some righteous pale ale bitterness. The pendulum has swung too far to the Uber neipa side, while Zombie Dust has remained strongly perfect and has done nothing wrong.	5
831	Zombie Dust	"**
09/27/19. Bottle to snifter. Shared with DC.. Yellow orange, creamy white head, excellent retention..  156 characters"	4.09
832	Zombie Dust	Not much to say that hasn't been said. My personal favorite beer and the beer I personally chose to have at my wedding. The pinnacle of an IPA and a modern masterpiece.	5
833	Zombie Dust	There have been so many reviews about this that I probably can't add to the information about it but I can say it has been very high ranking for so many reasons that I agree it is superb, excellent, wonderful, and other superlatives. They use all Citra hops which happens to be one of my favorite varieties for just enough bitterness and explosive deliciousness. There is a fine line of too little and too much but this has the sweet spot of exactly the right quantity of hops to make this beer so thoroughly enjoyable.	5
834	Zombie Dust	On tap: Carmel in color with a small head and decent lacing. Smells of citrus and pine. Pretty hoppy but good malt backbone. Pine, citrus and malt all come together to make a great beer that's flavorful without being bitter.	4.72
835	Zombie Dust	"Wanted to try this for a long time and was lucky to find some fresh on a recent trip to the Midwest. Pours a much deeper color than I expected, a burnt orange with a smallish head and just a little lace. Nose is certainly muted for such a highly rated beer. Some orange and earthy/herbal notes along with caramel malts, but much more subdued than I hoped for. Hard to believe this is an all citra beer.
Flavor is bigger. Drinks like an 8% beer and is well balanced, although the flavors don't really pop. Orange rind and caramel malts again...a little grapefruit, but this isn't a super citrusy beer. Resiny too, which helps balance the malt. Overall, a good beer, but it did not live up to the score here."	3.88
836	Zombie Dust	Bottled 6/21. Pours a clear amber with a thin white head. Pungent hop aroma and not much else. Bitter and floral hop notes with caramel malt notes on the taste, hops mellow out and become more floral and grassy as it warms. Evolves more than a lot of pale ales, and more complex than the nose would lead you to believe. Medium bodied and soft carbonation. Definitely a great beer.	4.13
837	Zombie Dust	I used to get this for $35/case at the brewery, then I got tired of it and craft beer passed FFF by. Too many comparably good options for much less money. Now that ZD actually stays on the shelf, it's become difficult to find fresh bottles. (Bottle dated 6/12 being drank on 7/1) Does the nostalgia hold up? The balance of the beer is what's key. Too many FFF beers have the same flavor, but the bitterness, malt, carbonation are just right with this. It's still too expensive, and I don't consider overpaying for beer to be 'treating' myself. But if some are content to pay more than $100 to see an 80-year-old Stones cover band, I guess I won't be judged too harshly for this pit stop. But I'm done. Felt like a douche sleeping with an old flame when I bought it, and I still feel dirty having drank this.	4.1
838	Zombie Dust	Very nice pale ale from a famous brewery that’s new to me. Tried this one on tap at 3 Floyds. Looks great, slightly darker golden-yellow-orange color with a little white head and nice rings of lingering lacing. Very nice aromas - lots of juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon and passion fruit fruity hops along with some floral and piney hops, nuttiness, caramel, vanilla and malt. Taste follows the nose, and there’s a great balance between the hoppy bitterness and smooth sweeter malt backbone. Good hit of bitter hoppiness at the finish. Smooth, mild, ever so slightly sticky mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. Really a great beer - not a 4.5 by any means, but truly very enjoyable.	4.34
839	Zombie Dust	"Appearance: Pours a glowing, but not bright,orange/amber color like an ember from a dying campfire.
Aroma: Strong citrus aroma of mandarin orange, ripe pineapple, grapefruit. A dank pine forest.
Flavor: Tons of nice mandarin orange, grapefruit, ripe pinapple with a dank and resiny pine flavor. A somewhat sweeter honey (maybe toffee?) bread malt body follows. A wave of bitterness finishes on the end.
Feel: Medium body, but a heavier mouthfeel. It captures the IPA level of hop flavor bitter astringency on the tongue, but follow with the perfect amount of malt sweetness to leave you wondering whether it's bitter, sweet, or both. Overall, though its dry on the tongue.. Compared to PsuedoSue: This one has a darker amber color. It has more dank and earthy notes. Not as airy. Less piney. A stronger bitterness. Much heavier bodied and more resiny. Not quite as smooth. Leans more toward an IPA.. Overall: An top shelf beer. I was initially blown away by the bitterness on the nose, yet when tasted it has such a strong malt balance to counteract that. It's the perfect balanced pale ale here and I'm not sure whether it finishes bitter or sweet. I think that's what makes it finish so well and would rate this pale ale as a top not because of that. I think it pioneered the style of west-coast IPA,"	4.33
840	Zombie Dust	"12oz bottle. 4/30/19 bottle date. Appearance: Dark golden orange, cloudy, with a fluffy white foam head and decent lacing.
Aroma: Dank, super resinous, and grassy, with a touch of citrus rind
Taste: Moderate malt sweetness, mostly caramel but also with a touch of cracker. A sharp bitterness rises with only.a hint of citrus and resin
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with carbonation on the Light side
Finish: Dry and resinous in the tongue. Strong residual bitterness leads over malt, building intensity after the swallow.
Overall: Prototype for an original American Pale Ale/IPA. The bitterness and malt character seem on the strong end for an APA. Definitely has a stronger malt base reflective of the traditional style as opposed to the newer evolution of the style. Clean and crisp with a nice dank and resinous hop character"	4.08
841	Zombie Dust	So, let's dispense with the BS that this is an APA - it's an IPA - and a damn good one!. Pours a light copper with over a finger of head. The nose is piney with dank notes as well. The flavor profile has a strong malt backbone with hoppy bitterness that is amped up to a Spinal Tap 11. Nice and resiny too.. The real magic of this offering is that it is only 6.2% but it has the bold flavor of an 8-10% DIPA. I only wish that it were more readily available here in Eastern PA.	4.5
842	Zombie Dust	The clear golden amber beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1/2” off white head that recedes slowly to become a cap of foam and then a thin irregularly shaped island of foam and a ring round the glass while leaving a web, rings and sheet of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a couple of long small arches and lots of small patches and slender legs of lacing.. The aromas have a nice fruity character that includes lots of citrus such as grapefruit zest and lime along with lots of tropical fruits such as mango and lychee. In the background there’s just a bit of toasted bready malt.. The flavors are much as expected from the nose with the tropical fruits and citrus from the hops. The very light sweetness from the toasted malt softens the bitterness but otherwise doesn’t really play much of a role in the flavor profile..  1,269 characters	4.25
843	Zombie Dust	This pale ale pours a dark, burnt amber color with modest finger and a half of soapy, rocky head that quick dissipates. The smell is a potpourri of floral notes, as well as citrus from tangerine and an orange juice quality to grapefruit and pineapple with a hint of papaya and mango. A touch of pine on the nose from the Citra hops, as well as a malty, cake batter or light vanilla sweetness to it. Up front, it’s earth and green with a mild hop dankness to it. The beer opens up with bready and caramel body with a slight tropical fruit note of pineapple and mango. Zombie Dust has a clean and crisp mouthfeel to it, with a resiny and bitter, but dry finish to it. Could drink this beer all day long.	4.6
844	Zombie Dust	In a blind taste test with really average IPAs we failed to pick this out of a lineup. It may have been king one day, but the hype is unmatched. Had a 2 week old six pack too. Either beers have come up a long way or this one has fallen. Not at all impressed.	3.82
845	Zombie Dust	Definitely a beer I would like to have regular access to, but alas, I snagged this bottle on a trip to Cincinnati.. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Golden yellow color with a great head and nice lacing. Citrus and herbal smell and taste. Sort of a dank background flavor I cannot identify. A bit peppery. Great beer!	4.29
846	Zombie Dust	Pours a golden amber color with a couple finger's worth of sudsy, off-white froth. The aroma is equal measures citrus and pine resin, with a bready underpinning. Wisps of yeast swirl and dance as gravity slowly overwhelms the rising carbonation, while rings of reticulated lacing adorn the glass.. The taste features a blast of astringent, resinous hops cradled by vigorous carbonation. Complexity, if I may be so generous, is afforded by notes of grapefruit pith and aspirin. Feeble, biscuity malt is mostly trampled by the hops. Medium body and high carbonation make for a zesty, slightly oily mouthfeel that thins out on the back end.. Overall, the hype for this beer is totally lost on me, even considering my usual biases. The bitterness is coarse and brutish, and there's next to nothing to speak of in the way of a malt profile. Honestly, I'd have a tough time distinguishing this from an anonymous IPA.	3.36
847	Zombie Dust	"12 oz btl pour into English pint glass.
Look: Light golden straw color. Yellowish golden smooth hue. Nice white head, good tight lacing throughout the beer.
Smell: Grapefruit, hoppy, pine, touch of vanilla.
Taste: Hop explosion on first taste, not overload bitter. Deep rich flavor. With tart slight dry finish. Wonderful!
Feel: Very smooth feel. Very drinkable refreshing feel.
Overall: Excellent. Not many beers I describe as food but his beer is delicious."	4.62
848	Zombie Dust	Picked-up in a trade with TimxOr. Have never had brew from these guys before (not distributed to MA). Bottled-on date of 1/29/19. Excellent APA, lived up to expectations.	4.5
849	Zombie Dust	"Looks- It looks like beer. Good lacing. Pretty head
Nose- It smells like a good beer. Not to danky. Just right"	4.66
850	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Bottle at share. Black, flat pour. Aroma comes in strong. Sweet, vanilla, bourbon. Taste follows , sweet, hint of roast, lots more of the barrel. Overall OK.	3.86
851	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	2018 vintage, dated 04SEP18, clocking in at 14.9% ABV; it pours pitch black color with a 2 finger brown colored head that fizzed and made crackling sounds, fading rather quickly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. A weak looking head for a BCBS variant.. What it lacks in looks it makes up for in the nose as this was a wonderful combination of fresh vanilla beans, vanilla extract, toffee, bourbon, caramel, mild char, cocoa powder, vanilla icing like you get off cupcakes and some sweet roasted malts. The vanilla is so incredibly fresh that it seems like someone poured vanilla extract into a stout. Exactly what I hoped it would smell like, I’m loving every second of this.. The flavor is equally as good as the aroma. The vanilla sweetness takes out the bitterness from the regular version, but it’s not to sweet to turn it into a dessert beer. The bourbon, toffee, char, light oaky notes, burnt coffee grinds and cocoa balance out the vanilla extract taste and it seems like a BCBS was aged on fresh vanilla beans and espresso beans. A year later and this brew still has some alcohol burn, but it’s so complex and enjoyable that I’m savoring each thick, delicious sip which gets better as it warms. World class smell and taste for sure, worth every penny of this expensive bottle.	4.7
852	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours nearly black, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin brown head that dissipates to patches with light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, vanilla, mild cocoa and bourbon. Flavor follows, with dark toasted malt, fresh tasting vanilla, a hint of cocoa and bourbon with some light oakiness in the finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Well, it's time to drink and review my last two BCBS variants from 2018, because the new batch is around the corner. I was a little nervous about this one because, while I like a touch of vanilla in stouts, I'm not a fan of over use of vanilla flavor. The vanilla here is a dominant component and tastes like fresh vanilla smells, but it blends nicely with the base BCBS. Mission accomplished, a fine vanilla imperial stout and a worthy variant of this classic stout. That being said, I'm not sure this is a big improvement on the stock Bourbon County and has a little less Bourbon character, which is one of my favorite parts of the regular stout. ABV is warming, but deceptively covered. Flavorful, well balanced and a gem of a stout.	4.36
853	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Pours black with a thin fresh khaki head. Smell has Vanilla Molasses,wood bourbon and roasted chocolate. Taste has vanilla nicely integrated into this stout it blends well with the chocolate,bourbon and wood. Nice thick mouth feel of the BCBS with the vanilla added very nicely.	4.25
854	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	The look was jet black with a small tan head. The smell was vanilla, oak, and chocolate. So sweet. The taste was very sweet vanilla and alcohol up front followed by some rich decadent thick chocolate. So delicious. The mouthfeel was deep and slick with low carbonation. This might be my favorite variant so far.	4.84
855	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	"A: Jet black with small amount of foam and light lacing.
N: Lots of vanilla with some barrel notes, malt, and minor chocolate.
T: Followed the nose, big vanilla hit with a light spice on finish, a little malt and chocolate feel.
M: Medium feel and very sweet.
O: A decent beer but a little too sweet for me, others may enjoy this but it was not something I would seek out."	4.06
856	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	It doesn’t get much better than this. Pours black with perfect carbonation. Cookie dough vanilla and overall brownie batter taste with the barrel. Perfect stout feel. It’s incredible - hard to find more words.	4.71
857	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	The look is consistent with pretty much any Bourbon County beer - pours think, pitch black, with just a touch of head that fades quickly. The aroma on this one is just incredible. Vanilla dominates and it's a sweet like vanilla cake or cream. Oak, chocolate, dark fruits, and some coffee are there as well. Fortunately, the dominate vanilla nose doesn't carry over to the taste. It is definitely there, but if it were as strong as the aroma it would be overwhelming. It's very smooth for the ABV, mostly hidden by the sweetness. Feel is on point and just like the appearance, consistent with others iterations of Bourbon County. Overall, this was very enjoyable. After BCBCS, this has probably been my favorite. The aroma is its best attribute IMO.	4.59
858	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	1 pint .9 fl oz, 9/4/18 14.9%, poured into a tulip glass. Pitch black. Just a thin rim of lace. Aroma of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla. Vanilla chocolate cake, with some heat. Taste is brownie mix. Vanilla. Chocolate. No soy sauce like some of the 18 regulars I have had so far.Carbonation low, sticky, dense. #800. A welcome variant , especially if you like vanilla sweetness.	4.41
859	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	500 mL bottle from Black Friday. Poured into Kane chalice and allowed to warm for an hour.. L: Very scant brown head that disappears almost instantly. Beer is the darkest brown or black.. S: Vanilla upside yo head. What smells like sweet dairy but probably isn't. Roasted malts, just a tad. The vanilla really dominates..  976 characters	4.53
860	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Bottle dated 05SEP18, 14.9%. Pouring from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a goose island chalice glass, this beer pours out very dark brown and forms a finger worth of caramel colored bubbles that dissipate quickly, leaving nothing for a crown.. The nose is huge. It brings layers of layers of sweet and rich decadence. Vanilla cake batter, fudge brownies, sweet chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, dark fruit, raisins, figs, warming bourbon, leather and dry oak..  1,193 characters	4.71
861	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	2018 Vintage. Appearance: Virtually black with a modest dark beige head that faded to a ring. Nice looking Stout.. Smell: Bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar and some mild alcohol notes. Not very forward but pleasant nonetheless..  945 characters	4.31
862	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Bottles shared at home, thanks Maarten! Jet black colour. Small beige head. Aroma is very heavy on the vanilla, overwhelmingly so, and a bit artificial tbh. Additional sweetness. Retronasal it's very sweet, vanilla a bit more balanced, and bourbon-boozy. Flavour is heavy sweet, chocolate, cocos. Full bodied, oily mouthfeel. Long finish. A bit overwhelming on the vanilla, but still delicious	4.27
863	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	"2018 Release, 14.9% ABV.
Bottled 05SEP18. 08:35.. Nice dark pour, not too much residual head or lace left behind. Stagnant motor oil.. Tons of vanilla on the nose. Undertones of milk chocolate and some lingering coffee notes, but Nilla steals the show here easily..  484 characters"	4.49
864	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	9/4/2018 1 pint 9 ounce bottle poured into a DFH tulip. Dark brown body topped by a smallish tan head which dissipated rapidly. Sipped this very slowly and eventually the carbonation completely disappeared and was like a British Barleywine. Smell was very vanilla and barrel forward with other undefined flavors lurking in the background. Taste was just gorgeous as competing vanilla, toffee, barrel and chocolate flavors interacted. Mouthfeel was thick and chewy; just what I needed on a cold early spring evening after I walked the dog (my avatar) in the rain and settled in to listen to music and read. For whatever reason, BCBS enhances my music listening experiences. Just a great barrel aged imperial stout.	4.57
865	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	"Pours pitch black and semi syrupy with minimal head. Massive chocolate and vanilla aroma, very boozy. Flavor is basic BCBS base with fresh Madagascar vanilla bean in its purest form. Carbonation adds to a creamy mouthfeel. Really, really good beer.. 3/30/19
16.9 oz bottle, 2018 vintage
4.5 rating"	4.46
866	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Taste: complex, rich, sweet, vanilla, bourbon, boozy, malty, dark fruit, raisins, cocoa, intense warming finish. Same with the nose. Black, opaque, tan head, delicate lace. Full body. 60 IBUs	4.37
867	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	on draft. appears jet black, opaque, with thick off-white colored head. wonderful aroma of bourbon, heavy vanilla, and some milk chocolate. taste is similar, very nice complementing flavors, bold without being over powering. thick bodied, very smooth.	4.61
868	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Dark brown color with a bit of tan foam. Aroma has chocolate, fudge and lots of vanilla beans. Taste is sweet at first with vanilla and fudge, toffee, some bourbon but not very intense, light roasted malt bitterness on the finish. Heavy body with soft carbonation. Really nice flavors with a good balance.	4.65
869	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	A: Beer pours a dark cola like black color from the bottle with a slight hint that of brown. Head quickly faded away but left a slight ring behind while drinking. Minimal amount of lacing while drinking the beer. Overall, nice but not outstanding example of how I picture a stout to appear.. S: Right from the bottle I notice hints of vanilla and chocolate sweetness. Could also pick up oak aromas from the barrel aging process. As the beer warms the bourbon and barrel notes become more prevalent as opposed to the vanilla and sugar aromas.. T: Taste is very similar to the nose of the beer. Beer starts out very sugary sweet and picks up more of the barrel flavor as the beer warms. The vanilla is present throughout but bourbon and oak become more apparent while drinking..  1,240 characters	4.75
870	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a GI BCBS snifter. Bottled on 9/6/18, making this just over 6 months old.. A: Pitch black, but pours a bit thinner then BCBS.. S: Trying to pin down this exact vanilla aroma. It's got some sponge cake in it, marshmallow, vanilla extract. It's more sweet and candy-like than it is thick and rich..  1,383 characters	4.71
871	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	A bit heavy on the vanilla until it warms up a bit, then the roasted notes and bourbon catch up. A flavor adventure that evolves with every taste. I prefer the regular BCS but this is a nice change.	4.37
872	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	Tasted from 10 year old bottle. Pours black with slight dark brown head. Awesome complex aroma and taste. Nose of bourbon and vanilla. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. No boozy notes at all. Flavors of caramel, molasses, bourbon, cocoa, and nice vanilla but not overpowering. Hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever had.	5
873	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	2018 vintag tasted in a snifter from draft at Whole Foods Market on December 5, 2018. Brewed with grade A vanilla beans from Madagascar. Notes of aromatic vanilla, marshmallow, toffee, oak, and floral notes highlighting the creamy mouthfeel and enhancing the chocolate flavors of the base beer. Delicious.	4.54
874	Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout	The beer pours a nice creamy brown head that dissipates at a moderate pace. The beer itself is a dark chocolate syrup brown with a nice looking creamy texture to it. The smell is pretty good. It has a strong creamy milk chocolate note with a sweet and sugary vanilla note with a tiny bit of bourbon to even things out. The taste is also good with a nice and strong vanilla and bourbon note upfront that is actually a bit sweet while the milk chocolate comes out. There is a tiny bit of vanilla bitterness that you get but it seems to be more of an afterthought. The feeling is good. It has a heavy and creamy body that flows silky through the mouth. Overall, this was a pretty good beer even though the vanilla isn't as good as it could be.	4.48
875	Doubleganger	This was a magical pour. The burnt orange color reminded me of a sunburnt 1967 les paul custom. I poured it into a 16oz Trillium IPA glass, and the resulting finger of foam formed was tantalizing. My eyes glistened as I grabbed the glass and positioned it to my mouth. I took my first sip. The day's stress vanished at the instant this magical nectar touched my lips. Spectacular. The hops took me on a journey through the outer-sphere of taste euphoria where I found love in its purest form. At this moment I realized that everything else in my life is meaningless, except this beer. This beer is incredible. I do not need anything in this world other than this beer.. After I finished my first can, I felt invincible. This stuff is incredible.. Chewy mouthfeel too.	4.81
876	Doubleganger	16 oz can. Canned 10-2, purchased 10-12, consumed 10-20. Has a typical gorgeous TH look - a glowing hazy orange with a nice head and great lacing. Smells like ripe tropical and citrus fruit. Taste is similar but more restrained than expected. Almost zero bitterness. Mouthfeel is, if anything, too soft. 8.2% abv is completely hidden. Overall, it is delicious but somehow this beer manages to be too mild.	4.34
877	Doubleganger	Pours like a golden slurry. Mango, sugar cane, pineapple, and grapefruit on the nose. There's a lot of Dole Pineapple with some zesty grapefruit. It's not as intense as I would have expected having had side by sides of other TH beers. Solid, just not great.	4.22
878	Doubleganger	"Look. fantastic
Smell tangerine rind hop bitter
Taste. very bitter start to an evolving hop presence. A citric onslaught with a bitter hoppy frothy finish.
Feel. Froth silkiness
Overall: Exceptional as with most beers here. This one being more bitter than others, still a great beer.
Not many things at the Tree I would not buy again"	4.53
879	Doubleganger	16oz. can into Nightshift stemware. Shared with schen9303.. At least this one's got a nice head. Nose is dense mango, peach, citrus and sweet clementine. An aroma of creamy lactose ties it all together. Super aromatic. Beer opens soft mango and clementine. I also get tangerine, papaya and pineapple sweetness. Rich and fluffy all at the same time. Finishes cane sugar, pine resin and more tropical citrus fruit. This one harkens back to the old days of Treehouse. Body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Smooth and rich but not full on the palate and finishes soft with a lingering aftertaste.. Just really a phenomenal beer. This one's up there with the best of them.	4.79
880	Doubleganger	Definitely a juicebomb. Typical Treehouse rill of slightly oversweetness. Not as bad as things like Sap or Green or Haze. Pretty nice feel. Not boozy too much. PRETTY Balanced. The malt makes spicy like Selma Hyek’s butthole. I’d buy it again probably. Just wouldn't drive all the way to Charlton.	4.18
881	Doubleganger	Thanks again to JC for this 16 oz. can. Sadly, most of its friends are already gone, with this soon to follow.. Looks more like orange juice than most orange juice, though with more fizz. The nose is orange sauce, mango, with a little white pepper stirred into the mix.. Doubleganger reminds us that “2 is better than 1” or “double is more than single” or “hitting the ball off the wall is better than a chopper through the hole if it’s my team, worse if it’s the Yankees”. In this case, the beer doesn’t have the oomph or fruit of most Tree House IPAs. Some orange, some mango, some citrus on the finish, with a bitterness that’s topical rather than internal. Plenty of sweetness from the malt, which seems to be masking much of the beer’s other traits. Thick. One & done here..  941 characters	3.5
882	Doubleganger	Typical TH pour into the glass - pulpy orange juice haze with a nice initial head holding. Decent lacing on the glass. The first thing that strikes you even upon opening the can is the presence of heavy hops and a sense of wort> I mean that in a good way as it smells like a brewery in the middle of the process. Almost a chewy drink with plenty of deep citrus (mainly orange with some grapefruit) & pine resin notes. Couple those taste notes with some dank and ripe tropical fruits. Feels lush and great in the mouth with an appropriate amount of malty bitterness following through. Super ale.	4.56
883	Doubleganger	16 oz. can dated 8/28/19. Poured into Ocelot Becher glass.. L: Golden-orange color. Nice 2F white fluffy head, good retention, leaves lots of webbed lacing and a cap and ring.. S: Very tropical in nature. Mango and pineapple predominate. Some lime rind and tangerine as well. Somewhat dank and earthy..  693 characters	4.53
884	Doubleganger	"Quick review - on tap at Tree House:
Look (4.25): orange yellow, opaque with some bubbles, creamy one-finger head
Smell (?): nice hoppy with a bit of citrus (forgot to record rating)
Taste (4.75): hop forward but not very bitter, nice crisp
Feel (4.5): lighter-medium body, a bit tingly, very crushable
Overall: 4.75"	4.58
885	Doubleganger	Oh my goodness this was an absolutely incredible IPA. Quite possibly one of the best NE-style IPAs I've ever had - very close to Tree House's Green, and a bit better than Heady Topper. Found this online, can date 7/17/19 so wanted to try it as soon as possible to sample it fresh. Juicy, refreshing, soft, hazy, everything I was looking for in a NE-style IPA - and my expectations were sky-high for this beer, as they are for any Tree House IPA. Looks absolutely incredible - orange-yellow hazy quite opaque color, a little white fluffy head and some nice spotty lingering lacing. More lacing would have bumped up the look rating to 4.75. Smells great, loads of fruity tropical hops - mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, maybe a touch of papaya. Definitely tropical and ripe fruit. Also some more balanced malt, vanilla, bread, and then some floral and grassy hop notes at the end. Dankness was muted and well-restrained. Taste follows the nose, again with a good balanced hit of both the bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Dankness at the finish was very well-received. The mouthfeel of these world-class NE IPAs is just ridiculous - soft, juicy, slightly sticky, coats the palate, smooth and creamy. Perfect amount of carbonation. The higher ABV was very well hidden and these ones are just so dangerous to drink as the alcohol will creep up on you. I could drink these all days and if they distributed anywhere in this region (Midwest) I'd find them and buy 6-packs galore.	4.68
886	Doubleganger	A TH favorite. From a can dated 7/17/19 (straight from can). The tropical flavors of Doppelganger revved up here and make for a delectable DIPA without booziness. On inspection, pours a cloudy. Flavor rich. I think one of the best NEIPAs.	4.75
887	Doubleganger	Can (one off) from De Bierkoning. Canned on 17 July, so 13 days ago. Pours a milky/juicy yellow colour, very cloudy, and a small white-ish (almost yellow) head with little retention. Aroma's: very dank with light citrus notes, oats and lactose. Retronasl the citrus is a bit more present, still with lots of dank hops and some sweetness. Flavour is light sweet and moderate bitter, with light fruity sourness. Medium bodied. Faily low carbonation. Light hopburn. Long finish, quite dry and moderate bitter.	4.21
888	Doubleganger	One of my favorites from TH. This beer is absolutely delectable. It takes what I love about doppelganger and somehow makes it more tropical. Guava, Grapefruit, Melon, papaya, and jackfruit hit you on the nose and the flavor follows suit. Anytime this beer is made I make a point to get it. It's just so easy to drink for a DIPA	4.81
889	Doubleganger	"1 PINT can
Served in an oversized wine glass. This beer pours a orange and turbid. It looks like orange juice. It is topped with a couple inches of tan head that leaves spotty lacing.. The smell is orange at first sniff. Once I dig in I get tropical fruit..  458 characters"	4.25
890	Doubleganger	Perfection in a can. Julius led to Alter Ego, which led to Doppelgänger, leading us to Doubleganger which I wish I could get at an unlimited supply. Elevated dry-hopped complexity which is unbelievably balanced. I would drink in gallons if possible. My favorite beer of all time.	5
891	Doubleganger	"Canned 06/12/19 “Sensual tropical fruit medley”
Only a day old! Unplanned trip to the brewery and happy to find this since I haven’t had a chance to drink Doppelganger. Without surprise, this is as smooth, creamy, dank, pungent, and juicy as this style can possibly be. So much tropical fruit. I just can’t find any flaws. Wow."	4.84
892	Doubleganger	Cloudy orange on the borderline of murky and vibrant with a thin finger of creamy-looking, tan-tinted head that leaves thick lacing.. Big aroma of mango, pineapple, herbs, white pepper, yeast.. Nice fruit medley in the taste: mango, pineapple, peach and fairly strong lime, along with some more herbs and a soft earthy, citrusy bitterness in the finish..  518 characters	4.3
893	Doubleganger	Really excellent beer. First can I had much fresher was better than this can I’m drinking now about 2 months later, fresher can was one of the best beers I’ve ever had, maybe a 5. Incredible creamy mouthfeel, a dank, ripe, tropical, citrus juice bomb. This older can’s mouthfeel is a bit less thick and creamy, a bit more of a rich syrup to it. Dank juicy mango, orange, lemon, peach, a bit of an alcohol heat that wasn’t present in the fresher can. Great beer, worth the hype.	4.75
894	Doubleganger	"Serving: Can
Canned: Apr-2-2019 (Consumed Apr-24). 
A:
It pours dirty orange with a finger of juice froth head.  Ok retention; isolated lacing specks. (4). S:
Juice cocktail. Orange, mango, carrots, guava, papaya, etc. (4.5).  878 characters"	4.52
895	Doubleganger	Tall can direct from the source - 4-2-19 version.. Clouded/hazed up TH NEIPA kinda pour...leaves some fine sheeting high up on the glass.. Super ripe fruit sniff, with melon, pineapple and smoky limes..  452 characters	4.4
896	Doubleganger	"Traded for this a while ago, as the can was dated 6/15 of last year with ""BEST OFFICE COLD OPENER"" written above it. Heard a lot about this beer and it was not easy to obtain but for some reason, this didn't stand head and shoulders above the better offerings that I've had from Tree House over the years. Full, dank, and full of underlying strength, this was a solid offering that improved greatly as it warmed up, but never did I feel that this was a ""wow"" beer.... Nice pour to this as the liquid was a muted goldenrod and quite cloudy, as was expected. Lots of tropical fruit rind in the nose with a good amount of mango, papaya, and kiwi in the muted aroma. The taste had all of those in it along with tangerine, orange juiciness, white chocolate sweetness, dank pine, and a subtly everlasting hop presence. Full of dough and malt, this had a good body to it for one of their beers as this was certainly not your typical hop bomb or overly typecast New England IPA. The moderate head and spotty lacing were signs that this wasn't as impressive as I had hoped but still had enough depth to be a solid beer.. Enough booze was here although I never tasted or felt it at any point while enjoying this. A solid beer for the winter, there were plenty of fruit flavors and potency here to keep me interested and warm throughout, but this was short of being spectacular. Fans of Tree House will certainly not be disappointed with this, however!"	4.35
897	Doubleganger	"This beer is awesome.
Big haze and big white frothy head. Classic tree house.
Nose haze a mango tropical breads nose
Flavors are similar. Big mango and peach but the back end is balanced with some malt. Keeps things balanced. Doesn’t finish bitter or sweet. Really just awesome.
Can taste a smidge if alcohol on final sips.
Delish overall"	4.68
898	Doubleganger	"Can dated 1/18/19. Poured into Belgian tulip.
Look is dense orange haze with a white head. Nose is orange pith and rind, mango, some berry in the back. Taste is peach and mango, lots of orange rind at the end leading to soft bitterness in the finish, big lingering orange. Mouthfeel is medium-full and pretty fluffy. Overall really nice orangey DIPA. Good stuff."	4.43
899	Doubleganger	"Pouring a cold 16 oz can into my snifter. The beer pours a cloudy goldenrod color with 1.5 cm of dense bleached white head foaming up from an aggressive pour. I get a mix of citrus and pineapple notes on the nose. I also get a bit of a creamsicle note on the nose. The alcohol is well hidden and I dont get a lot of malt character here.
First sip reveals a soft silky textured body with gentle rolling carbonation. The beer is amazingly easy to drink especially considering the bigger ABV on this one.
Flavor is what is expected from the nose on this brew. I get some orange zest, a bit of grapefruit rind and some tangy pineapple. The fruits dominate the flavor profile here and only a hint of bitter hop comes through on the finish. I would say this is rindy or pithy note and it lingers with a slightly drying finish. Still no real hint of the booze and this beer is very drinkable just like its sibling doppelganger. I like this one and place it towards the top of TH IPAs on my list."	4.54
900	Fuzzy	Very similar to Smooth.. Differences. Light color from the white peaches.  572 characters	4.67
901	Fuzzy	Pours a clouded amber to orange color with a fizzy, small head, which immediately diminishes to a small coating.. Smells of leaf wrapped ripe peaches, offering a bright fruitiness, which comes close to actually cut a peach into half and enjoy its aromas. This inherits not only the fruit‘s pulp but also its stone pith quality, adding a soft soothing quality to the sprizzy, slightly perfumy and floral fruits.. Has a higher, finely nuanced carbonation, with an effervescent finish, among a lighter, yet versatile and intense lighter body..  1,569 characters	4.35
902	Fuzzy	B3 - I have to say I like how this is not as acidic as the other vintages. I mean sure, it’s tart, definitely, but it’s millions of peaches, peaches for free/me/us! Dug it.	4.4
903	Fuzzy	Tasted from bottle. Blend #2. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Big sour funk aroma of lacto with peaches. Taste is very sour. Flavors of peaches with lactobacillus. Very nice peach flavor with a lot of pucker.	4.33
904	Fuzzy	good peach sour. long finish. ren's bottle. spider lace. not overwhelming sour. very fruity. a delight. great balancing. A bit of orange fruit colour.	4.04
905	Fuzzy	Everything's just peachy at the Side Project brewhouse when the brewery takes their Missouri raised fruit and embellishes a Brussels' styled sour ale. Aided with chardonnay barrels, the character of this sour ale simply keeps building.. Fuzzy comes with a slightly peach stained gold color. Hazy with suspended microflora and a touch of wheat, the beer's light froth casts a sour scent over the senses. Sour peach, white wine, citrus, oak spice, sea air and an earthy drift of saddle leather captivate the nose while tepid sweetness teases the early palate with sourdough, light candy and whole wheat.. Sweetness is short and easily dissolves once it hits the middle palate. Meanwhile the sourness gains steam and brings an underlying taste of lime, lemon, crabapple, gooseberry and sour white grapes to the tastebuds. Its piquant sourness is laced with white pepper, oak and a abrasive spice of acetone and rice wine vinegar. Dry hay and grapefruit peels decorate the finish while the overcast of peach and nectarine encompasses the entire session..  1,263 characters	4.31
906	Fuzzy	Truly one of the best sours out there. Hard to get your hands on but worth the price. Unfortunately, when you get a pour or bottle it does not last long. I had this at Side Project bar in early 2017, visiting a friend in St. Louis. I believe it was the second batch, good haze with a bright orange. Had a sweet complexity of peaches that developed into everlasting funky, earthy, acidity that beckoned another sip. Must try if you are a sour lover.	5
907	Fuzzy	B1 Starbright, mid-high clarity, champagne effervescence, appropriate head and retention per style, straw-green hue; errupting notes of underipe apricot and peach, lemon zest, lemon juice, flesh, damp slate, damp grass, damp barnyard bedding; under and over ripe peach, apricot, peach pit sweat, lemon rind and juice; pleasant and thin feel with appropriate effervescence, residual and cloying acid and sugars;. B2 Bright, straw, moderate haze, great head and retention per style;	4.65
908	Fuzzy	On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma is funky and floral with unripe peach and apricot and hay notes. Taste is tart, fruity and lactic with some fruit pit bitterness.	4.3
909	Fuzzy	Had this at the Firestone Walker 2017 Invitational. The long line paired well with the hangover I was nursing in the heat. Pours innocent and yellow with a chunkee or two floating around and a super thin mild head that was gone before I took a sip. Wow, what a great aroma. Peach, brett, barrel, funky yet dry. Pretty top notch in that department.. Taste, oh man I could drill this all day. Nice soft white peach envelopes the mouth, not overly acidic or sour, just right. Carbonation on point, the nice little white wine notes are complimentary. It is definitely upper echelon fruited wild ale territory. Doubt I would ever trade for such a thing because it is so damn valued and there are comparable beers like this in my neck of the woods (De Garde- The Peach). Its almost as good as O'so's peach wild ale. So I'd say it is running #2 in the Midwest, which is still a huge compliment. Peach and sour fans will dig it.	4.24
910	Fuzzy	"What an excellent beer. Amazing nuance and waves of flavor. Perfect fruit balance. Very well done. Best beer at Shelton Bros ""The Festival"" 2017 IMHO."	4.92
911	Fuzzy	Had a 4oz pour at a bottleshare. Look wasn't anything crazy but the smell was so complex showcasing barrel,funk, and loads of peaches in perfect balance. The taste was both jammy and some dryness in the back. The feel was medium and effervescent. Overall a great BA fruited wild ale that i hope i can get my own bottle to share with the wife.	4.72
912	Fuzzy	Shared a 375 from the most recent batch with my brother. This was my first beer from side project and I think he gave away a little much for it. I like this beer overall and was very drinkable. I thought while tart and sour it wasn't over the top like some are saying. At the same time it wasn't very bold. I could have crushed the whole bottle to myself easily but in the same vain of IPAs I'm not really a session guy. Just expected something more.	3.93
913	Fuzzy	Batch 2 375ml bottle. like biting into a fresh peach. So juicy and just the right amount of sour. Nose explode with peach, tangerine and a hint of acidic apples on the back end. A great beer!	4.76
914	Fuzzy	I had been wanting to try this one for a long time and it did not disappoint. Perfectly carbonated with just the right amount of sourness and so drinkable at 8%. Just wonderful.	4.75
915	Fuzzy	Bottle poured into fluted snifter.. Golden straw, clear with careful pour, Large bubbled foamy head pops out into bubbly collar and floating islands.. Aroma is tart peaches mixed with ripe and sweet peaches mingling with yeasty funk..  559 characters	4.6
916	Fuzzy	Pale and transparent straw color. Creamy lacing with great retention and glass sticking. Awesome peach and acid aroma with mild wood. Initial burst of tartness on the palate, vinegar and lightly citric. White peaches midway: sweet, light, dry and perfectly integrated with the delicate malt. Subtle oak and funk with underlying white grapes. No way to tell this is 8%. So subtle and well blended it tastes like 5%. Light and creamy feel, perfect carbonation, dry finish. Subtlety and balance are hallmarks of this gem. As close to perfection as any beer can achieve.	4.93
917	Fuzzy	Pours a clear straw color with a finger of white head even on a small 5oz pour. Head foams up quick with large bubbles, and yet despite this retains well. Aroma gives off notes of apricot and yeast with little else to distract. Flavor profile is the same with an addition of grape. The flavor profiles packs a light tartness that mingles on the edge of sour. It's nothing crazy wild in terms of sour, but just enough to add another dimension to the flavor profile. Mouth feel is fizzy and fuzzy with a medium-thin thickness. Overall, this beer is flavorful. It drinks more like a champagne then anything else.. Served from a 375mL bottle into a stemmed glass. Reviewed from notes.	4.71
918	Fuzzy	Pours a clear peach color in the glass with no head. Smell is fresh peaches. This beer has aged a bit, but the peaches are still bursting out of the glass. Sour peach candy, wet hay, bread cracker, oak, subtle band aid. The taste is mouth puckering tart and bursting with peach skin and juicy peach flesh, green apple, white wine, and some lemon. Oak and subtle funk add complexity. I've never had this fresh, but it would seem this is developing some nice complexity in the bottle. Mouth feel is sturdy and on point. Carb is rich and full bodied. Nice acetic vinegar notes add strength to the flavor and edge to the mouth feel. Excellent.	4.68
919	Fuzzy	The best American sour I have ever had. This is on par with Cantillon for the funk and sourness. This beer was super sour and tart, but so drinkable. Loved it.	5
920	Fuzzy	Unfortunately, it's sort of one-note. It tastes like a sour, unripe peach. That's it. I wanted the Side Project funk, and it's just not there. It's just flat out warhead sour. Good, but I am wanting more.	4.06
921	Fuzzy	Gold in color with a light cloudiness and a fingernail of dishwater white. I smell peach, pear, and green apples. The taste is a delictable lightly tart green apples, pear, peach, and tart Brettanomyces. The mouth is bone dry and moderately carbonated.	4.38
922	Fuzzy	A - Pale orange color with heavy white lacing.. S - Dominated with lemon, citrus, and funk.. T - Tart citrus peel, puckering lemons, and a puckering finish..  298 characters	4.25
923	Fuzzy	Batch 2. Tulip glass.. A: Light gold with a thin crackly layer of white head. Good clarity but a bit of haze; a few dots of lacing but pretty good retention.. S: Horseblanket melds effortlessly with bright stone fruit (fleshy peach) and apple juice, rich white wine, with some definite floral notes in support. Light vanilla fills out the aroma. Maybe a bit of acetic acid. The peach is light but still noticeable..  1,058 characters	4.42
924	Fuzzy	Hazy pastel yellow settling to clear-ish gold, with a large foamy white head that dies to a thin ring.. I smell some spicy funk, peach, and peppery hops.. Taste is a little bitter, with spicy hay, weed, and horse blanket, contrasted by sharp Pez, and fresh peach, finishing dry..  635 characters	4.06
925	Westly	Pours hazy and orange like a New England IPA.. The beer showcases SARA's signature saison softness on the palate, with great flavor and acidity, mild funk, and a burst of fruit flavor on the finish.. One of SARA's finest works. This is unequivocally better than West Ashley	4.69
926	Westly	This one pours a hazy bright orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.. This smells like vibrantly sour apricot, citrus, ripe fruit, oak, loads of sour white wine.. The apricot flavor just bursts forward here - with tongue-tingling sourness and drippy juiciness - it's so authentic and wonderful tasting. There's a lot of barrel too, wine slathered all over it, with some mildly tempering oak as well. There's also a sort of general sour citrus character, as well..  714 characters	4.49
927	Westly	I had been wanting to try this one for a very long time and it didn't disappoint at all. So much apricot, but not too sweet and very drinkable. This one lived up to the hype.	4.75
928	Westly	07/2016 - This is incredible - hype realized! Gueuze-esque; peach, apricot, funk on the nose; wee cinnamon, fruity, barnyard taking over the palate; acidic, yet still oh so clean of a finish; dope!	4.66
929	Westly	Pours a clouded amber-orange color, with a froth, stable head.. Smells of yogurt, orange sorbet and fresh cut apricots. Got a unique funk profile to it, which leads to a apricot stone pit quality among wet earth and moldy wood. While this is pretty fruit centered, it leaves enough space on the palate for the funk to play an important role on the aromas, as it sets the state of the fruits somewhere between wet and juicy.. Has a soft, lighter mouthfeel, with a well nuanced, sparkly effervescence during the beers finish..  1,209 characters	3.74
930	Westly	Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adarius tulip glass. Drank right after tasting West Ashley Thanks Jake for the trade.. Pours a hazy light orange body, looks almost pulpy with a one finger white fizzy head that reduces quickly. Leaves little lacing.. On the nose, it’s very fruit-forward and champagne-like. Tons of stone fruit aromas, very juicy and potent. Psyched to taste this based on the nose!.  828 characters	4.74
931	Westly	2017 bottle poured into a SARA bulb. Bright orange with some haze. Small white head forms and dissipates quickly. Smell is of stonefruit, funk and acidity. Taste is amazing. Ton of stone fruit, subtle funk and acidity. Super balanced. Feel is very nice. Actually found this to be a little “thick” and was very effervescent with the bubbles. Overall, this is an outstanding beer and deserves the hype. Thank you George for sharing!	4.69
932	Westly	This has a beautiful apricot color with deep stone fruit flavor and refreshing medium mouth feel. It's very balanced and well made, just don't expect anything super complex. I don't see the need to pay the price to acquire this, but it's certainly a very good beer.	4.5
933	Westly	2015 B2. Had at apricot share with about 35 other apricot sours and siasons. Top notch apricot saison. Thought the finish is what separated it from other apricots. Great smell, and terrfic light airy, not that sour. I woulds say this and La Fosse B2 one the share for me. I love Fou but 15 was a little lack luster compared to westly.	4.81
934	Westly	2014 batch drank on 4/2/2017 side by side West Ashley. Look - hazy, dark orange. Definitely a boldness too it, with minimal head and incredible lacing for a sour. Smell / Taste - bold! that's an understatement for sure. This is a stone fruit explosion. Just so strong and powerful and done incredibly well. The wine barrels and oak pop out with some nice complexities under this burst of apricots..  493 characters	4.85
935	Westly	The rating is from memory of tasting Westly 2014 (4/2016). Had Westly 2015 on 2 occasions and for me, even on a slightly fatigued palate, 2014 was far better.	4.75
936	Westly	Overall pretty epic, it takes everything I expected West Ashley to be, but much more mellow and deep in flavors. After this and Fou I am a believer in apricot sours!	4.4
937	Westly	"L: Bright honey, apricot hues that are warmly greeted by a thin white head
S: Nectarines, Meyer lemons, tangerines, and apricots on the nose
T: Huge jammy notes of apricots, orange marmalade, and an acidic orange juice
F: Amply carbonated with a moderate mouthfeel
O: This was simply incredible. For me, West Ashley fell a bit flat, but Westly flat out impressed me. Hands down this is one of the best apricot sours on the market and blew West Ashley, Fou, etc. out of the water. Highly recommended and an absolute treat to imbibe."	4.83
938	Westly	Pours a orangish yellowish hazy color. Mild head retention. Smells of acidic apricots with a nice barnyard funk. Taste is incredibly balanced with the tart, acidity predominate but very smooth. There is not much alcohol taste with this high ABV. One of the best wild ales I have ever had.	4.78
939	Westly	Ok this looked more like orange juice than any beer I've ever seen. Nice, pulpy orange juice. Aroma was of citrus lactic sourness.. Taste, wow, amazing stuff, I must admit. Kept going back and forth between this and Bourbon County Coffee at the festival. So much apricot, orange and light oak impressions. This is really up there with Fou Fune, slightly better than Cascade Apricot, Bruery Filmishmish & Rare Barrel Map of the sun. Great fruit flavors, just the right amount of sourness without too much harsh acidity.	4.47
940	Westly	wow! thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this rare gem, its always a pleasure to get to share these with close friends. this might represent the final evolution of the apricot wild ale, and after being only lukewarm on the west ashley (in regards to all the hype), this one really takes it to the next level. twice the apricots and twice the time in barrels! the pour is hazy short of rusted orange, pale and soft looking, no visible particulate in here, but still sort of raw looking. nearly a full inch of airy white head lingers. the aroma here is near perfection, about is forward as apricots have ever been, including allagash, cascade, crooked stave, and yes, cantillon too. its juicy and bright, sweet enough, even fuzz on the outside just a little bit. oddly nutty like the pits but that could be a handover from the wood. the fruit is pulpy and ripe and dominant, but there is a great mixed culture sourness backing it up, cutting the sweet, and highlighting some of the wheaty grain base and oak treatments, all well integrated and powerful, but also quite mellow and approachable as they go. the flavor is still really ripe apricots and interesting funk and sour combined. the fruit is incredible here, maybe a step short of its explosive aroma, but really pungent and to the point. it tastes like a fresh apricot in the peak of the season, as true to the fruit as any of the beers out there. its quite sour too, a lot of lactic acidity, ahead of the wild funk aspects, and well ahead of the oak. it gets even more sour as it warms, which it does in this instance because i cant put my glass down to stop smelling it! a bottle of this might be a lot as a solo mission, so i was really glad to be sharing it. i could see the acidity getting overwhelming. its like too much of a good thing, a third of a bottle was exactly perfect. probably the best expression of apricots i have seen in a beer, and the white wine notes from the wood and the yeasts are a great compliment to the fruit. easily the best of the beers i have had from these guys, and probably the new benchmark in the style. unlike the west ashley, this is entirely worth all of the high praise it gets! a memorable experience.	4.55
941	Westly	A delicious beer indeed. Bright orange color pours with virtually no head, juicy fresh apricot and hay nose, bright stone fruit vinous juiciness with a funky tartness that just leans on the edge of sharpness. In a vacuum, this beer certainly stands on its own merits. However, I can't help but to weigh the vast difference in the cost of admission versus West Ashley/Fou as compared to the difference in quality, which is, in my humble opinion, marginal.	4.56
942	Westly	On tap at CBC 2016. Pale golden with a thin white head. Apricot, brett, some citrus and fruit sourness. A good sour beer, but not as good as the hype surrounding it.	4.25
943	Westly	An amazing beer! I was able to have Westly at two different tastings a few months apart. The first time side by side with West Ashley. Kicks WAs ass...the Westly is just that much more complex and amazing! Tons of fruit!!! 2nd time it was side by side with Abricot Du Fermier and again Westly was triumphant!	5
944	Westly	Desert island beer right here. These guys have some great bugs and it shows big time here. I would take this against a Fou all day and I think that says a lot. Massive fruit flavor, low acidity. A+ all the way. Get this. Drink and enjoy. Repeat. (If you're lucky)	4.92
945	Westly	Probably my favorite fruited sour to date. The color is a golden orange. Smells of fresh apricots. The taste follows the smell, huge apricot bomb. Slight amount of funk that gives the beer great depth. Wish SARA made more of this. The hype is real and I will continue to seek more of this delicious juice.	4.98
946	Westly	Batch 2, 2015. One of the best fruited sours I've had. Had this side by side with a couple other stone fruit beers, Fou, Leaner, etc. This was by far the best. Fruit was prominent, funk played a backseat but it worked so well for this beer. Just lovely. Blows West Ashely out of the water.	4.74
947	Westly	This beer was pretty tasty. Was not as acidic as I thought it would be (a good thing). Taste was awesome. Was it worth the hype? Probably not, but glad I was able to share this beer with a friend!	4.6
948	Westly	Looks like apricot nectar but a little brighter. The smell is lemony with some fresh apricot peel. The apricot is sharply acidic out of the gate like underripe peel then balances into a fleshy finish. The base beer is quite complex like a hybrid of a farmhouse ale and a wild ale. The acidity is clean like the fruit added to the tartness level.	4.46
949	Westly	Hazy light orange. The nose is all apricots with a strong sour punch. The taste has less sour than the nose, with a smooth apricot taste. The feel is very juicy and clean. Overall a very great beer.	4.71
950	Double Citra®	Pours out hazy yellow orange. Color of pineapple juice. Small ring of carbonation.. Smell is pineapple jumping out of the glass. Some mild plant/floral hop presence.. Taste is strong hop flavor but without the bitterness. Pine, pineapple, green vegetable, peppery, grassy. Any bitterness is extremely short lived. Minimal malt profile..  541 characters	4.24
951	Double Citra®	12oz can purchased at the brewery. Pours a hazy dirty orange with an inch of head. Moderate amount of lacing. Lots of citra hops in the nose. Orange, lemon, grapefruit and some sweet fruity candy. The taste is more of the citra. Orange, tangerine, grapefruit along with some mango and pineapple. Orange, lemon and peach finish. Some alcohol heat. Medium body with a dry mouthfeel.	4.27
952	Double Citra®	Orange juice color with a light tan head topping it off, this beer glides down your glass and clings like Velcro. Wow, what a sight to see.. Dank citrus notes dominate the nose, with juicy tangerines, pineapple, and grapefruit leading the aroma parade, and those aromas translate perfectly to the taste, with the glorious addition of a vegetal taste that softens the citrus acidity, and the slightest bit of caramalt flavor to lend the perfect balance to this phenomenal DIPA.	4.52
953	Double Citra®	"Oh my.
I was lucky enough to enjoy a can of HF Double Citra over Labor Day weekend in New Hampshire. A friend had recently purchased at HF. I apologize because I neglected to check the canning date.
Just incredible. I haven't been ""wow'd"" by many DIPAs of late, but this knocked my socks off.
Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. Full on hazy orange (a bit darker orange than OJ). Creamy white head.
Smell of ripe stone fruit, mango, with solid underlying dankness (weed). Out of this world.
Taste was delicious, with notes of ripe peach, candied orange, dried apricot, and a nice dank resiny finish.
Mouth feel was soft, rich, and full, with perfect medium carbonation, fully enveloping the taste buds. Mouth-watering goodness.
Quite possibly the best DIPA and best beer I have ever had, definitely in Top 5. Juicy Dank Lively Complex Goodness! Hop Candy! 100+/100."	5
954	Double Citra®	More orange than golden pour, creamy bright white head, and the smell! Pop the top and it's like someone in the room just sliced a grapefruit. We know we're dealing with a single hop beer, and the taste, while consistent and one note, still takes you on a journey. The Citra comes through loud and clear, and then at a point in the midtaste, that taste kind of ramps up to a new level. And let's not forget that long, luxurious aftertaste. Brilliantly crafted.	4.5
955	Double Citra®	Double Citra pours a milky and creamy orange color with a complex white cap on top that lingers leaving some impressive lacing. The smell is a true NE style DIPA, big and juicy on the nose with layer upon layer of Citra hops bringing out the citrus and tropical fruits including mango, grapefruit, peach and a hint of melon with some earthy tones and an herb quality. The taste, this is closest I've come to a perfect beer. Wow! This Double Citra tastes amazing, very soft and smooth over the palette with a light body that brings out orange, tangerine, grapefruit and some melon sweetness with a subdued bitterness.	4.59
956	Double Citra®	Pours an opaque orange with two fingers of frothy, dense white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is a blast of tangerine, papaya, lemon and mandarin oranges. Grassy hops and a light bready yeast at the back rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, lemon, mandarin oranges, and bready malts create a soothing hypnotic experience. Balance is sublime, never coming off overly sweet or bitter. Mouth feel has a consistent siltiness to it with a medium-thick consistency that adds power to each sip. Overall, a delectable brew with big tropical fruit notes, and a well-refined balance.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can.	4.71
957	Double Citra®	Phenomenal. Best HF IPA I've had.. Gorgeous hazy appearance. Smell is dank hops and melon.. Taste is watermelon rind, citrus, dank hops, cantaloupe, and even more dank hops. Hops make the bitter finish that's just particularly interesting. It's not a normal bitter. It's almost a sweet bitter which is an oxymoron I guess. So good. Barely a hint of alcohol..  397 characters	4.66
958	Double Citra®	Received two cans in trade from DanPing (great trader), in exchange for some Tree House brews. My second brew from these guys. Absolutely outstanding, one of the best brews I have ever had.	4.75
959	Double Citra®	04/2014 - Oooh, that Citra mustiness, plus citrus, hops up front; chewy, flavorful mouthfeel, clean too; so fucking good and by far my favorite solo Citra hopped beer out there!	4.75
960	Double Citra®	"Serving: Can
Canned: Aug-20-2018 (Consumed Sep-9). It pours a milky orange color with a half-finger of cream-colored frothy that settles to a fat film. Okay retention, concentric rings of lacing. It has a distinctly orange Julius-like aroma with a little earthy bitterness in the background. The flavor is more on the earthy than the fruity end of the spectrum but is far from bitter. Candied orange, moss, crusty white bread. It is immensely drinkable, with barely-there alcohol and a creamy feel that completes the orange shake impression. This is a highly serviceable beer with everything where/how it should be. I can't say that I am surprised coming from HF."	4.54
961	Double Citra®	A: Pours the usual dark-ish super hazy yellow color. The head is pure white and looks very creamy. Retention and lacing are pretty good. The look of the beer is 100% NEIPA.. S: The nose is pure mangoes, juicy orange, light pine resin, mint leaves, peaches and even a very faint strawberry note. Superbly complex yet coherent. Very fresh.. T: The tastes is exactly like the smell, except for more pine resin than in the nose. You get a ton of mangoes, orange (juice and peel), mint leaves, peaches and again a light strawberry note. Incredibly fresh with no malt notes whatsoever. No chalk at all..  977 characters	4.97
962	Double Citra®	Appearance is a nice amber with a slight white head. Aroma is a strong citrus with a tough of hops. The taste is also a fairly strong citrus with a touch of hops.	4.49
963	Double Citra®	Appearance - Pours cloudy yellow with nice thin white cap that settles to a thick ring around the glass. Nice sheets of lacing down the glass.. Aroma - Huge pinch in the nose of citra hops great juicy slightly bitter aroma of orange and a touch of grapefruit. Nothing else needed.. Taste - Taste is a super balanced combination of sweet orange and bitter citrus peel/grapefruit. Could not ask for a much better taste, no bells and whistles just in your face hops. Alcohol is well hidden..  660 characters	4.85
964	Double Citra®	"Had a brewery and brought grower home, poured growler in pint glass.
A: frothy 2 finger white fine foam bubbly head, hazy golden wheat body, long wisps of stringy lacing carbonation
S: citra hops screaming with citrus, orange oil, hints of malt
M: medium body with juicy finish
T: orange, citrus, malty, smooth hop resin builds and some bitterness comes through, minerally, slight note of alcohol in the end
O: great smooth crisp brew"	4.51
965	Double Citra®	"Canned 1/22/18, Enjoyed 2/14/18 poured into a snifter. Acquired in a ship trade for some stouts.. Look: Great fluffy foam that lingers, minimal lacing. Deep yellows, light orange haze. Well blended, no sediment.
Smell: Very wet and acidic. Spice/pepper in the primary. Mellon, sweet potato, orange, lime meringue in the secondary.
Taste: Spice/pepper in the primary. Mellon, sweet potato, orange, lime meringue in the secondary. Dank weed and earth post taste.
Feel: Light and acidic upfront, balanced by a nice peppery, savory, resinous feel. Salty enough to keep you coming back.
Overall: This is a very interesting brew that opens up nicely and become quite complex over time. I contribute the month old can to the unpleasant tastes, but I still really enjoyed this. I will be seeking out a fresh can in the future for comparison. Definitely one of the better HF brews. Well done."	4.62
966	Double Citra®	This was absolutely great. There's a difference from Citra to Citra. Hill Farmstead sourced the absolute best Citra hops and this has the same perfect balance that you get from most HF IPAs	4.91
967	Double Citra®	"Canned 1/22/18 Drink by 3/5/18 12 oz.. A Double Dose of Citra hops!!
The pour brings forth a cloudy, dirty golden color liquid with white and amber highlights. A fresh, all white foam covering lasts long, bubbly froth continues full coverage with impressive lacing.. A very classic New England style DIPA nose....mega sweet, tropical fruit, sharp and peppery citrus galore! Sweet piney and spruce tip aroma's with light, grainy and honey sweet malted barley...a bit tangy and earthy, hints of vanilla way down deep..  1,164 characters"	4.76
968	Double Citra®	"Pouring a cold 12 oz can into a snifter. the beer is part of a recent trade with my friend Craig. Thanks!
The beer pours a hazy gold to orange color with a fleeting bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a frothy surface layer quickly after the pour. The aroma is strong and hop centric with grapefruit and lemon with a bit of resinous pine sap mixed together. I also get just a bit of biscuity malt buried in this hoppy brew. I dont get any booze notes on this one.
The first sip reveals a fairly light crisp body with very fine and tingly carbonation. The texture is smooth and the beer glides across my palate effortlessly on each swallow.
The flavor is as the nose advertised at the start of this sampling. There is a bit of sweet biscuit malt and then a lot of citrus hop character with lemon and some orange mixing, which rolls to some more bitter rindy grapefruit. The beer dries out on the finish and does leave some rindy and resiny hops on the finish. Again I dont detect any booze and the beer drinks very easy. Quite a nice double IPA"	4.51
969	Double Citra®	Had on tap at my favorite VT bar, Blackback in waterbury. Everything outside of the taste is completely stunning, and the taste is damn good too. The smell is full of rich hops, juicy citrus, especially lemon and grapefruit, floral, herbal, and savory notes. It pours a beautiful haze with a finger of foam, that laces beautifully down the glass. Feels rich and full in the body. Taste is impressive, with citra driving the rest of the many supporting flavors. Wow	4.65
970	Double Citra®	A masterpiece feature of the citra hop, now sold in cans. Was thrilled to bring a bunch of this back home with me. Soft feel, dank citra, clean finish, hard to believe at times that it was 8%.	4.79
971	Double Citra®	Tasted from draft. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice white head. Phenomenal nose. Aroma is grapefruit, lemon, pineapple and a little orange. Taste is moderately bitter with a nice malt backbone. A little more bitterness on this then some of the other Hill Farmstead IPAs as well as not as creamy a mouthfeel as some. Flavors of citrus and tropical fruits with some pine and cracker malt notes. Definitely one of the best imperial IPAs I've had.	5
972	Double Citra®	Look is full on hazy dirty peach color with nice white head.. Smell is citra hops all day.. Taste follows the nose.... citra hops in a big way..  255 characters	4.55
973	Double Citra®	On-draught @ my favourite bar in NYC.. Currently, this has a 100 on Beeradvocate, and is #57 in the Top 250.. Notes are regrettably brief given a bar environment..  1,400 characters	3.59
974	Double Citra®	On-tap @ As Is in NYC. Notes from 3/22/2017.. Light amber and hazy with a soft, creamy white head sitting on top. Orange, grapefruit and peach make up a fruity and floral aroma. Smooth citrus flavor. Although it's difficult to pick up any malt flavors, it's clearly there providing a substantial base for the hops to be showcased. Bitter at the tail end, creamy and full without becoming too heavy. No sign of alcohol despite the 8% ABV.. Overall, I wasn't wow-ed like I thought I would be. A citrus-forward beer with restraint, but a little too much so. That being said, what a rare treat to be able to walk into a bar in the city and drink this without having to trek to rural Vermont. NYC drinkers, you are fortunate indeed..  806 characters	3.89
975	Ann	My long time white whale, we meet at last.... As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.. The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more that I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time..  1,543 characters	4.52
976	Ann	Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow.	4.65
977	Ann	Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach. Taste is something else, oaked white wine, apricot, peach, light cellar notes, white grape, hay, picking up a light honey-sweetness and very light funkiness. Lighter body, carbonation holding up pretty well.	4.83
978	Ann	Batch 4, 375mL bottle served into a bulb glass onsite 4/18/18.. First half of pour was crystal clear golden body, second half was slightly hazy and a bit more orange. Good two finger white head that sticks around for a while.. Aroma – I didn’t smell these all at once, I don’t even think that would be humanly possible, but noted them as it warmed and developed in the glass over a half hour or so. Honey. Lemongrass. Nectar. A delicate woodiness. Floral. Vanilla. Cedar. That musty, herbal smell when you walk into an old country store. Grassy. Hay. Pine cones. White wine. Potpourri. Fresh spring day frolicking through a meadow of hay..  993 characters	4.75
979	Ann	"The beer pours a Clear bright yellow with a thin white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of citrus, lemon, oak, honey, vanilla, and a little brett.
It tastes of citrus, lemon, honey, oak, vanilla, tangerine, wine, and lightly tart on the back end. It is very light, clean, and simple. This is the perfect beer, doesn’t have a ton of wine or funk, but doesn’t need it. So easy to drink and goes down fast."	4.94
980	Ann	A: Pour is slightly cloudy, with a golden yellow hue. Head is about a half inch, with great retention and generous lacing. S: Vinous grapes and apples, herbal, floral and fruity. The notes are extremely gentle and involved: oak, wood, lemon, citrus, honey, with a slight funk component. T: Hints at a subtle tartness and sweetness, while being earthy floral, and fruity. More funk, brett and barrel character, as one reads into it and lets it sit. Notes correspond to the aroma, and bring forth honey, oak, grain/hay, lemon, and citrus.  744 characters	4.63
981	Ann	Finally, after a few years, and some adventuresome and muddy miles, she landed. Soft golden hue, fluffy juicy head, gently wine, oak barrel, and microflora tones both on the nose and taste, and silky smooth. Definately matches up with the hype. It was her, it was she, it was fabulous!	4.67
982	Ann	"2014 batch drank on my wedding day 1/20/2017. L-slight haze, bright lemon gold with a white head. Smell and taste follow each other which is best stated as ""complex"". The honey and lemon come through nicely just like Anna and there's a nice tartness added as well. The wine barrel is prevalent and adds a nice level of bitterness and oak. I would have guessed a subtle red wine barrel, but it seems more like chardonnay is the likely barrel used. Makes perfect sense. Earthiness and floral tones were present as well and the overall lingering unique note was something either cinnamon or comparable to it. It was really incredible within everything else in this beer..  891 characters"	4.68
983	Ann	Was fortunate to try this a few weeks back onsite. What an amazing delicious beer. Smells great, feels great. Great complexity with it. Very happy to say I tried it and it lived up to what I thought it would be.	4.85
984	Ann	Pours a gorgeous honey gold with a beautiful white head that retains well and leaves ample lacing.. The aroma is delicate and enticing. Light tartness, lemon grass and rind, honeysuckle, wheat, funky brett, honey, and much more! Super complex!. The flavor follows the nose, with a nice light lemony tartness to open, followed by wheat, honeysuckle, and honey. It finishes with delightful brett funk. There are many layers of complexity, and it is super delicate!.  683 characters	4.9
985	Ann	2014 Vintage from the taproom. Finally got to have the beer I have most coveted since I started visiting the enchanted beer mecca in 2013 and have proceeded to make the trek once a month since. All the trips finally paid off as it was there for on-site consumption. Had side by side with Le Sarrasin and Being and Time which might have thrown off the overall ranking. This was smooth as silk, fluffy clouds, extremely pleasant with where the base honey beer accentuated the wine barrel. The smell wasn't over powering, or super aromatic to me. A little bit of funk, don't know if that had to do with it being a 14. Once again the feel was the crazy thing to me and defintley stood out. It was super drinkable and if this was a beer I could have on a regular basis to have with dinner it would be amazing. I have to say that there was something tin the way Le Sarrasin finished that I like it better. This was a joy to try and hopefully will run into again. $33 for a 375 to the dome is worth it all day.	4.49
986	Ann	The 2014 vintage, poured on-site at the Hill Farmstead taproom.. L: Golden copal pour with medium head and lacing.. S: Virtually everything on the top half of the bottle pour is wine and barrel. The bottom half of the bottle opens up with floral notes, some honey, a little citrus, and subtle funk..  882 characters	4.65
987	Ann	Nice subtle honey without being overly sweet, and very smooth to drink. Of course its delicious but it wasn't quite the world breaker I was expecting. Definitely don't pass on it, but there are IMO much better beers to trade half your cellar away for.	4.49
988	Ann	On-site pour decanted into their branded wine glass. Dregs into a taster glass on the side.. Golden straw color, fairly hazy, but not near opaque. Light flows through and brightens the brew. Barely off white head, foamy, settles to ring around the glass.. Honey, white wine grapes, floral, slight yeast and funk. Lots of layers in the aroma. Citrus zest in the background..  667 characters	4.84
989	Ann	"Batch 1 bottle
L: Dark orange yellow honeycomb hues with a translucent body and greeted by an amply carbonated white head
S: Clover honey upfront that is swiftly met by the oak wine barrel and rich malts
T: A huge range of flavors - this might be the most complex saison I've ever tasted: honeycomb, marmalade, tangerines, clovers, slightly tart funk, rose petals, and sweet malt that is underpinned by a healthy, well-integrated oaky chardonnay
F: Softly carbonated, medium bodied, and infinitely smooth
O: What a rare treat to enjoy this bottle! This was simply a gorgeous beer that encapsulates all of the myriad strengths of Shaun Hill and his talented team at HF. From the deeply rich look, first impressions of the nose, to the flavor profile throughout, Ann delivered on all levels for me. Of the great American saisons produced (e.g., SdF, Saison Bernice), Ann squarely sits a top on her throne as queen - this beer is untouchable, complex, and continuously rewarding throughout the session. I'm incredibly lucky to have snagged a Batch 1 bottle and it has held up incredibly well nearly half a decade later. Just an excellent beer - no other way to say it."	4.96
990	Ann	Had it onsite at the brewery yesterday. Tons of honey in the smell but not much on the tongue, lots of white wine type flavors. Great beer but probably not one of my top favorites.	4.75
991	Ann	From a bomber. Pours golden. Smells tart, citrusy, only hinting at funk. Taste is exceptional: tart opening, laced with hints of honey, moves into perfectly balanced funkiness. The most nuanced wild saison, and just one of the top 5 or so beers, I've ever had. I live far enough from the brewery that a visit would require an overnight stay in the area, but this one made me start thinking of how to take that trip.	4.79
992	Ann	Hill Farmsteads finest! Amazing BA Saison that is smooth with a nice barrel finish. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!	5
993	Ann	"Batch 3 served onsite, 375ml.. Look: Crystal clear golden hue with a typical pillowy white head for Hill Farmstead saisons.
Smell: Subtle musty funk, slight barrel presence and faint malty sweetness.
Taste: Not many more ways to say it than flat out ridiculous. The most balanced and restrained barrel aged saison I've tasted. Sweet malts lead to a mildly oaky/funky middle and finishes with a very subtle sweet white grape skin. Just a touch tart but not sour. Balanced and supremely drinkable.
Mouthfeel: Somewhat softer carb than the base beer, very smooth but full bodied. If possible it's an improvement over the shelf saisons.
Overall: Stunning beer and I am supremely grateful to have gotten a chance to try it. The 375ml dissapeared far too quickly, it took willpower to not demolish the beer in minutes. Unreal, one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking."	4.94
994	Ann	Bottle at the brewery on 3/10. Delicate fermentation, honey from base beer is all but gone. Nice, mellow tartness, lots of barrel characteristic. Funky finish. Very good, but I don't think it quite deserves the hype, nor value it gets.	4.71
995	Ann	"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a large tulip glass.
A - Wonderful clarity, steady carbonation feeds well disciplined white cap.
S - A bit of wine, mixed with hints of limestone and ash, a refined aromatic boardering on
Loire valley white.
T - Slightly tart, vinous, lemon grass, honey notes.
M - A wonderful lightly carbonated delight, the sides of the tongue react to the tartness, a wonderful coating
of slight sweet finishes the experience.
O - A superbly crafted offering, world class in every aspect.
Cheers"	4.24
996	Ann	"Bach 2
What a masterful creation. Right away with a blast of crisp acidity that starts it off and stays woven throughout only mellowing just a tad for the onslaught of continious flavors I found dissipating into that signature HF soft mouthfeel. Impressive noticeable touch of wine barrel/oak, slight sweet honey, all wrapped perfectly together only to finish with some lingering tartness. Even the clarity of Ann was beautiful to look at as I savored each sip."	5
997	Ann	One of my all-time wants. Glad to finally try -- thanks James. Had back to back with Anna and you could really see the refinement. This is the sophisticated big sister with all the sharp edges smoothed off. Lovely, vinous and soft. This is definitely worthy of its top tier status. I would likely go with Sarrasin as the best HF saison, but this is right there. Phenomenal beer.	4.75
998	Ann	A - Hazy medium orange color, thick creamy white ring.. S - Tart wildness, mild acidic funkiness, and citrus.. T - Lightly tart, acidic, funky, light citrus, oak..  303 characters	4.46
999	Ann	This poured out as a nice hazed golden color with a thin white head. The smell of the beer is really nice, good amount of Yeast and wine barrel aroma, subtle funk, with melon and citrus in there too. The taste is very nice also, plenty of tart lemony flavors there is a honey sweetness in there blended with the funk. Overall another outstanding saison from Hill Farmstead.	4.64
1000	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2017 edition. L: Inky black pour... comes out like oil with 2 fingers of foamy tannish head. Modest lacint.. S: Rich and roasty... cinnamon and spice, cocoa, and espresso..  676 characters	4.74
1001	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty and dark, with cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, cocoa nibs, toffee and molasses creating the bulk of the nose. Roasty and toasty malts are supportive and abundant. Flavor profile is huge, hitting notes of cinnamon, cardoman, nutmeg, molasses, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, coffee, chocolate and cocoa nibs. Big sugary notes, but they are balanced out by roasty and toasty malts. Mouth feel is thick and full, with a modest level of graininess. Overall, deep and expressive with loads of flavor. Lovely stout!. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 750mL bottle. 10th anniversary bottle.	4.63
1002	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Slightly overrated IMO. This stout is on the high end of the cinnamon war, so if that's your thing - you must try it. No too sweet, I'll give it that. Otherwise I've found many more balanced brews in the category, such as Coffee Cinnamon Bourbon Abominable by Fremont. Hunahpu is worthy of a try and of forming your own opinion, but you may also not find it up to the hype.	4.35
1003	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	2016 vintage (released 3/12/16); drank 5/21/16 @ Yuss Haus Mach II.. Black appearance.. A violent pour yielded a big, noisy dark khaki head; nice lace..  410 characters	4.25
1004	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Everything great in an imperial stout, deep brown to black, creamy tan foam. And a subtle hint of spices and chili peppers. A great example of how to add a lot of flavor and spice to a beer and not ruin it.	4.38
1005	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Would I buy this again? Yes, but only one bottle cellared at a time. Do t see any reason to cellar for extended period of time or collect for verticle.	4.5
1006	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	2-1-19: 2017 version from bottle at home. The heat with this one is mild. I can definitely taste the cinnamon. This seems a bit thin. For me the hype doesn't quite match the taste. Maybe I need to try this fresher.	3.45
1007	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	I finally got to try this whale after a trade. I thought it was similar to Abraxas. I had a 2017, and may have bunkered it too long with the flavors becoming much more mild than other reviewers indicate.. Honestly, I've had plenty of other better beers within this category that are not on the Top 250 list such as Prison Barrel Aged Wham Whams or some of the Evil Twin or J Wakefield Stouts.. Beer pours black with a caramel color head. Smell of pepper and vanilla, but very subtle. I was expecting a much stronger nose..  663 characters	4.27
1008	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	I finally landed this whale. I have wanted to drink this beer for the last five years. I am looking forward to this review. I popped the top off and a hiss emitted. The beer is 52 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer just glugged out of the bottle as I poured it into the glass. This thick beer produced a two finger dark brown head. The retention on the head is phenomenal. The head dissipated slowly and left no lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 nearly black. The beer is opaque.. The initial aroma I got from the beer is dark roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, and dark chocolate. Next, I smell vanilla, molasses, chili, raisins, bready, char, and leather. The beer has this earthy garden aroma that I get on the backend.. Holy Moly! The flavors in the beer are dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, chilis, vanilla, molasses, raisins, anise, char, leather, earthiness, smokiness, char, bready, and a vegetal note..  1,263 characters	4.87
1009	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Fascinating and very complex beer! The chilis come through, but are not overpowering. This is a sipping beer, and I'm glad I had a small pour at the brewery. Great stuff--I've been to Cigar City a number of times, but this is the first time I've seen Hunahpu's on tap. Hooray!	4.49
1010	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Very pretty looking. Pitch brown in all the right ways. Love the little lacing patches that linger after each drink. Lots of cinnamon on the nose to go with dark almost leathery chocolate. Mexican heat heat too - brightens up the same notes from the nose and adds some notes of chiles.	4.37
1011	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Did this blindly with Abraxas & Mexican Cake.. This beer is pitch black with no highlights whatsoever. Along with the ring of caramel colored crown attached to the glass, it has islands in the middle. Looks great. 4.75. The smell has peppers, but they are more green pepper like more than anything. Vanilla mixing in there as well. This one is the most underwhelming smell of three. But still prefer it to #2. (Mexican Cake) 3.75.  1,490 characters	4.01
1012	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	"Reviewed from notes from an early November share.
Poured black with a finger of dark brown head.
Smells of dark roasty malts, peppers, cinnamon.
Taste follows, roasty, charred malts, cocoa, peppers(not terribly spicy), cinnamon, and vanilla.
Full bodied smooth.
Overall a great stout that is hypeworthy."	4.44
1013	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	"2014 bottle poured in November 2018.
Pours nearly jet black with very low levels of khaki head.
Aromas are lots of roasted malt, some peppery heat and coffee.
Flavors are perfectly balanced deep roast, coffee, chocolate and peppers.
Mouthfeel good but a bit thin.
Overall...very nicely crafted."	4.37
1014	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	This pours onyx black with the darkest brown head I’ve ever seen on a beer. The nose has the chilies up front, but there’s a mother lode of other aromas - cocoa, cinnamon, char, vanilla, literally a plethora of notes that blend perfectly.. And they blend better on the taste, if that’s possible. I get the chilies first, probably because I love spicy flavors, and the spice has some bite, but the cocoa and vanilla flavors balance the heat, and then the cinnamon lends a churro quality to this that elevates it to the top of the world-class quadrant. Simply magnificent, IMHO.	4.6
1015	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	04/2014 - Amazing nose of cinnamon, vanilla, wee cocoa, some spice; velvety mouthfeel, chilies hit hard and remain on the palate; sweet, spicy, vanilla on the finish.	4.46
1016	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Dark, thick beer with darkest, thickest head I've ever seen. Aromas include coffee, chocolate, molasses, dark malt and done fruitiness which is reminiscent of raspberries or cherries. The taste is all that but amplified. There is cinnamon in the flavor I did not detect in aroma. This is a thick, chewy, decadent beer. Really amazing.. Just wish it had a little more spiciness.	4.78
1017	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	"In a snifter, at nearly room temperature, the beer was black with a one-finger cinnamon colored head.
Aroma of chocolate, cinnamon, and pepper.
The taste is where this beer shines. Intense dark chocolate. Cinnamon. The chilis are very noticeable, but are complementary and not intrusive.
This is a wonderful big, bold beer. It more than lives up to its hype."	4.88
1018	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	22oz bottle at share. What a way to wash that previous stout out of my mouth. This is was truly excellent all the way around. Silky black pour with small ring of beige head. Roasty, woody aroma. Taste brings in some sweet roastiness, a nice mellow bitterness, and a lovely creamy texture. Thought this would be the evening's winner, but there was a better one out there....	4.41
1019	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	Had on tap at brewery May 2018. Lots of hype, but wow did it live up to it. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg, slightly buttery, super smooth finish. Dangerous delicious beer.	4.56
1020	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	"Bottle Date: 2018
Palate Contaminants: other beer. Behold, the legend. Let's see if it's as good as I remember it.. It's dark, and I've seen what appears to bee darker, but I spilled a few drops, and I couldn't see any light through the 1/16in of liquid. Extremely dark head that basically matches the liquid. Relatively heady for the type. Surprising amount of lacing..  1,237 characters"	4.64
1021	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	So many well blended flavors, it's a journey of a drink. Enjoy it. Marinate on it. If only it was a bit thicker, but I'm splitting hairs here, simply delicious.	4.65
1022	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	An 8oz pour On draft as a pilgramage to Cigar City Brewing. Poured into a snifter , dark brown liquid, pencil thin Byron foam settles to a bubbly brown ring. Aroma of roast malts, chocolate, whiff of cinnamon-y spice.  531 characters	4.31
1023	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	A 2018 bomber bottle poured into a tulip glass.. Look- This has to be the blackest beer I have ever tried. A thin darker brown head and thick lacing. The beer seemed to just stick to the glass leaving it looking like a window tint. Very thick. Smell- An interesting mix of chocolate, vanilla, and spicy type peppers. The blend was strong but not overpowering. Like an awesome slice of chocolate cake..  1,003 characters	4.84
1024	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout	"2017 version
A unique beer, particularly among the ""Mexican hot chocolate"" style beers.. Among the blackest, darkest pours I have experienced. Borderline black paint look out of the bottle. Deep brown frothy head with thick lacing.. Aroma is cinnamon forward with chocolate, vanilla, roast, pepper, and oak, though not particularly strong or overwhelming..  942 characters"	4.57
1025	King Sue	Pours a hazy light straw color with less than a finger of head. The primary note in the nose and flavor is citrus, particularly pineapple. The finish is plenty hoppy for a single IPA. BTW, this offering is NOT a DIPA, notwithstanding the marketing.	4.17
1026	King Sue	"Look As a proper IPA should, light yellow mixing a little towards orange
Smell. Juicy loveliness quite nice for a store buy
Taste. Mellony pineapple . Just damn nice sweet perfect finish. I would say that is what makes this stuff top tier
Feel . Because its a double it has a nice thickness feel FREAKIN juice man
Overall. Definitely spendy.but this stuff is awesome , I was skeptical and now I am not."	4.55
1027	King Sue	16oz can into a pint glass. Packaged 10/3/19, so about a month old.. Orange juice body with a small white head leaving a little lacing.. Aroma is a hoppy with some mild fruitiness..  563 characters	4.37
1028	King Sue	"LOOK - super frothy 2-3 finger head - very cloudy / looks like orange juice - great head retention and nice activity - can't imagine it any better
SMELL - strong mango and pineapple - slight pine - some sweet bready and malt aromas waft up
TASTE - nice hop bitterness punch - a landslide of pine, mango, peach, pineapple, green apple, and some citrus - sweetness in the middle - slightly dry at the end - pretty complex (like a basket of fruit) - yeah there is a little wheat and bread in there as well
FEEL - nice creamy feel / medium bodied - carbonation is pretty persistent
OVERALL - what an amazing DIPA - the style here says that it is a NEIPA - by how cloudy it is I can see that, but it is labelled on the can as a DIPA - regardless, this is a powerful IPA with loads of flavor - if you like hops, you can't go wrong with this one - this is up there with Pliney in the DIPA category for me"	4.83
1029	King Sue	Pours right gold, cloudy with a dense white head. Aroma is fresh, tangy citrus, a little floral. Taste is intense tangerine and stone fruit with a base of moderate bitterness behind it. Not dank or overly sweet but just clean full flavor. Feel is soft and puckerish.. This is just a fantastic dipa, no burn, all flavor that just rocks.	4.78
1030	King Sue	Outstanding to be getting this beer shipped fresh to Mass. It lives up to its reputation. The feel is tremendous, rich and creamy. Fantastic NEIPA from way outside NE.	4.78
1031	King Sue	From can. Aroma has lots of ripe melon with sweet peach notes. Taste follows with the ripe melon flavor and underlying vanilla sweetness. No bitternes.	4.4
1032	King Sue	Now I have to eat some of my older words: This is an exceptional brew from Toppling Goliath! The first from them that I have enjoyed. I have only seen this once - bought it and was very glad I did.	4.74
1033	King Sue	As someone who lives near Treehouse, I have had a lot of it. This is every bit as good as a Julius in my opinion, maybe better. I found an odd can in the singles rack at my local beer store and snapped it up. They sell a lot of Topping Goliath near me but never the high rated stuff like Marshmallow Hanjee or Assassin.. This is very Treehouse-like in that it is hazy, orange colored with a slight head and the hoppy aroma of citrus and grape bubble gum. It has a smooth mouthfeel and the tropical fruit, pineapple, passion fruit and tangerine flavors are very present.. This is the kind of beer that you can drink all day ... although given the higher ABV, probably best not to. While this isn't the best beer I've ever swilled, it is right up there with Treehouse for a hazy juice forward New England IPA. I'd certainly buy a 4-pack if ever it was available near me.	4.6
1034	King Sue	TOPPLING GOLIATH KING SUE IPA 10/14/19. This longtime top-rated IPA finally arrived in my state. Caned 8/28/19. so about 6 weeks old.

1036	King Sue	At the Pub in Pemb roke Pines. Fl. I was a about to beer out when this beer caught my attention. Hazy in the glass, just like apple cider...smooth and fruity after taste, alcohol marked by the smoothness of the afterdraft. Complex....I like this beer a lot....and folks continue to dri k beer and support you local brewery. HOG.	4.74
1037	King Sue	Pint can packaged 2019-08-28. Pours a cheery orange, opaque and cloudy with a full finger of head. Pleasant green mango and citrus on the nose. Some fruit carries through to the palate, but predominantly a lot of hop burn and some pepper--not at all what I expected, given that I saw no sedimentation goop when rinsing out the pint can for recycling. In any case, this is coming across a hit hamfisted and very over the top, rather than balanced.	3.72
1038	King Sue	16 oz can. Packaged 8/28/19, best by 12/26/19. Pours very turbid hazy dark brownish yellow with a medium bubbly white head that retains fairly well and leaves some lacing.. The aroma is sweet floral grainy wheat malt with some fruit.. The flavor is sweet wheaty malt with reserved fruity hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation..  382 characters	3.03
1039	King Sue	Haze Bomb poured in a glass. Big tropical, dank notes on the nose (Mango, Pineapple, sweet). The flavor on this beer is just unreal, sweet Pineapple, grapefruit and mango. So easy to drink. No lingering bitterness, smooth all around.. Fantastic beer.	4.59
1040	King Sue	Appearance: the color is a hybrid of lupulin and pollen – yellow. The head forms a 1-finger of white. Fair retention that fades to a thin veil.. Aroma: juicy pineapple and light spruce. Inviting. The hops smell super fresh. The malt is light and sweet.. Flavor: pineapple, mango and sawdust. The hops have a sort of muddy aftertaste, though, but not oxidized. Enjoyable nonetheless..  744 characters	4.34

On bottom of can “PKG 08/28/19 BEST BY 12/26/19” Four-pack traveled in my cooler by day and spent the nights in hotel reefers.
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Bright yellow, murky.
Body – Yellow (darker than Pseudo Sue), murky and opaque.
Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), off-white, medium density, long duration, diminishing to a three mm crown and a thin complete cap. Lots of torn curtain lacing remains on the glass as the head retracts.
Lacing – Good. Lovecraftian mountainscapes of tiny to medium bubbles with deep valleys separating. See also above.
Aroma – 4 – Tropical fruits but less citrusy than expected.
Flavor – 4.25 – Very good. Very tropical fruity with some definite mango flavor without the cloying sweetness. Tastes very fresh. No alcohol (7.8 % ABV) flavor or aroma, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25. Very good example of a New England IPA, one I would actively seek."	4.1
1042	King Sue	"Can Date: 7/17/19
Palate Contaminants: none. Pale yellow straw color. Good amount of very fine head, plus a little lacing.. Loads of citrus on the nose. It's more unripe orange than grapefruit, but I'm definitely getting both. Light pine. It's detectably sweet, although it's in the pleasant range, which seems to be difficult to really pull off well, Good intensity..  761 characters"	4.36
1043	King Sue	I don't get all wacky with long winded reviews. I enjoy beer enough to travel to Belgium where the best beer in the world is brewed. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Loved the hazy appearance. Good nose of citrus. King Sue is a excellent citrus type IPA. Very, very refreshing without being a simple IPA. Not bitter which is what simpletons like.	4.77
1044	King Sue	"Growler into pint glass. Pours a very hazy burnt amber with an off-white, persistent head. Initial impression is a very balanced, mildly bitter brew - citrus notes but certainly not a juice bomb. The appearance would lead you to expect a pillowy NEIPA, but that's not the case. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would expect for a 7.8% beer, but then King Sue seems to delight in thwarting unfounded assumptions. Finish is smooth and slightly bitter.
I'm not sure I would classify this as a NEIPA. It LOOKS like one, but its bitterness and mouthfeel are more reminiscent of a West Coast IPA. If I was drinking it out of a can, I'm not sure ""NEIPA"" would immediately come to mind.
So I'm not much for surprises, and this beer surprised me several times. The last but not least surprise is that I really like King Sue, despite it not being anything like what I expected. It may not be my absolute favorite IPA, but it's delicious."	4.09
1045	King Sue	The emphasis in the beer is a strong, sharp, hoppy finish with citrus highlights. It’s a throwback to the brewing style emphasizing a hoppy edge overshadowing a citrus profile. Newer approaches to a DIPA have more balanced citrus flavors with a more subdued hoppy finish. Excellent beer.	4.04
1046	King Sue	Very subdued beer for the %. Flavor notes come across subtly which I like. Tastes super smooth and has a very clean after taste. I pick up on the mango and orange after I swallow the beer. Grew on me. Not super impressive at first but it is an excellent beer.	4.6
1047	King Sue	Date: Canned on 08/19/19, enjoyed on 09/09/19.. Appearance: Sound the haze alarm, Sue looks like a glass of full on fresh pureed oranges with a finger and a half of sudsy almost whipped cream looking white colored head. Just straight up bright almost floresant orange in color but a thick and chewy looking beast.. Aroma: Pow, up front there is just this huge blast of tropical fruits but it is a very multifaceted aspect as the mango brings a thick syrupy sweet element while the pineapple and orange contribute a juicy sweetness as well, they also have a soft and at times somewhat acidic quality. The more I try to pick out another part, the orange I get. Underneath all the various fruity aromas, there is an awesome, slightly dank but very pungent ultra green and herbal dry hopping component. It may not be the most varied nose ever but its what Toppling Goliath has managed to do with it that is the most impressive..  2,026 characters	4.49
1048	King Sue	Bright look. Lots of floaties. Great tasting ipa. Smells of citrus. Orange, grapefruit. Tastes very...juicy. I think I tasted a bit of honey even. Really enjoyed this one.	4.76
1049	King Sue	Canned 8/19/19. The tropical fruit notes of pineapple and mango are nice but there is a lingering, abrasive, caramel sweetness that needs blunted by more bitterness. Good stuff, but I'll be on the look out for fresh Pseudo over this one.	4.14
1050	Atrial Rubicite	L - 1.5 finger white-pinkish head is slow to recede. Body is a murky, opaque maroon.. S - tons of sweet, tart raspberries. Brown sugar. Oak.. T - raspberries for days. Real raspberries too, not artificial sweetness. Tart, brown sugar, only moderately sour. No bitterness. Low sweetness. No booziness..  366 characters	4.53
1051	Atrial Rubicite	It took a lot to get one of these so I was anxious when I popped the top. I was happy to be greeted by a a funky raspberry aroma. From the smell, I thought it would be sweet, but it was pleasantly dry. What a great beer! My only regret was that I drank it too fast- so damn tasty. A trip to Austin is in order.	4.87
1052	Atrial Rubicite	Beautiful deep read with a minimal Ruby lacing around the circumference of the glass. Nose is pure Raspberry and some the jester King culture, very dry. The nose made me concerned that if was going to be pure acid. Suprised that it was a dry raspberry flavor with a subtleness of wild microflora. Feel is initially effervescent on the tounge and then quickly dissipates. Overall excellent, think it can slightly more carbed	4.45
1053	Atrial Rubicite	"L: Deep Ruby in Color. Thin pink head that dissipates quickly
S: Straight Raspberry Jam
T: You get the raspberry jam that the nose presents, but it is met with a lot of acidity. It isn't unpleasant though. A slight amount of oak at the end.
F: Medium body with a fairly high carb level
O: This beer is very good. It could be slightly less tart, but it has enough raspberry jam to back it up. Overall, this is quite nice."	4.51
1054	Atrial Rubicite	Not my favorite style but I still enjoyable. Pours ruby red with dark pink head. Smells of tart raspberries. Taste is sour raspberries, very sour to my taste but classic to style. Bubbly and refreshing.. I have two more bottles that will be enjoyed best during a hot afternoon on the porch.. Won’t seek out again for the price and effort.	4
1055	Atrial Rubicite	"Raspberry...funkiness....leathery...dusty....tart.... Truly a masterpiece.... absolutely spectacular beer... nails everything you could ask for in this type of beer.... 
Raspberry is perfectly done.... not too acidic at all... sour but not distracting... sweet in the right spots....  307 characters"	4.65
1056	Atrial Rubicite	Batch 8 (June 2018), poured into a JK SPON tulip. The look is amazing; deep ruby, almost mistakable for a Bordeaux. Moderate carbonation that dissipates very quickly. The nose is full of jammy raspberry and signature JK funk; moderately musty, dusty, and woody. Palate is mildly tart and acetic, with plenty of jammy raspberry, oak, and some yogurt (especially on the finish); getting close to a fruited lambic in style. Very enjoyable.	4.49
1057	Atrial Rubicite	Batch 8 poured in Casey teku. Pours a bright vibrant clear ruby red with a soft whispy pink head. Nose has that mellow Greek yogurt smell going on with a blast of tart and sweet raspberries and cherries. First sip is a little of everything. Tart, mellow funk, musty, jammy! I love the depth and intensity of the raspberries. It’s definitely jam like, perfect tart to sweet ratio as far as the berries go. Nice mellow wet oak throughout that really ties it together. Musty cellar like quality and mild yogurt funk all come together to make this beer what it is. As it warms the raspberries shine even more and tartness builds but this beer is equally interesting on both the colder and warmer side. Body is medium to Jammy at times. Tart funky dry finish at the end that invites another swig to wet the mouth and start the process all over again.	4.53
1058	Atrial Rubicite	"What's not to like here? Pours a burgundy with a finger of pink head. Smell is fresh, sweet yet slightly tart raspberry. A hint of oak.
Taste follows with tart raspberry, a bit of barrel, some funk
Medium bodied with dry finish.
Overall an excellent fruited sour. Beyond tart but doesn't take the enamel off of your teeth sourness."	4.81
1059	Atrial Rubicite	09/2014 - Incredible raspberry and cherry aromas with some oaky, yeast coming through; tart, acidic, fruity, flavorful body; wee thin of a body, but it's superb overall!	4.48
1060	Atrial Rubicite	I've been chasing down a bottle of Atrial for a few months now - I missed it at the Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers (FOBAB) in November of 2017 (kicked in the VIP session), and I've had a couple of trades fall through. And then, suddenly, I had TWO trades go through within a week of each other! Exciting.. I shared my first bottle (blend seven) with friends recently. Atrial smells tremendous - I love the sweet, tart, rich raspberry nose. The beer itself is quite a lot dryer than I had expected and tremendously tart. It doesn't punch you in the jaw with sour, but there is a pleasant sourness to it. There is definitely a barrel presence in that dryness. I was surprised by how dry it was, given that sweet, juicy, almost cloying nose to it!. While the bottle hunt was frustrating, I think it was ultimately worth it, and I'd happily do it again. I need to try more of Jester King's fruited sours - their saisons are excellent and easily purchased, but the sours are what really interest me...	4.91
1061	Atrial Rubicite	On tap at Hops and Pie. Extremely purple with a pink head, vibrant colors. Smells like a jar of raspberry preserves, very jammy and fruity. Sweetness as well. Flavor was mostly raspberry preserves and a slight sourness. I understand now why people might seek out Jester King.	4.29
1062	Atrial Rubicite	Poured from a mini bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. Love the artwork. L: Clear deep red/burgundy pour with 2 fingers of foamy fink head. Great retention and leaves a thick rim of sticky lacing. Looks like red wine with head.. S: Tart and fruity.. raspberry, summer fruit, and funk..  709 characters	4.58
1063	Atrial Rubicite	2015 bottle (Blend 5) - deep lipstick red with a thin white/redish head that quickly goes away. Smell is heavy raspberry with a little funk. Was somewhat let down by the lack of farmhouse funk smell. Flavor follows. Overall a superb beer, just may have aged a touch too long. At nearly three years old, I think this maybe aged 4-6 mnoths too long.	4.81
1064	Atrial Rubicite	Batch from June of 2017. Pours a dark rich red/purple with some carbonation. Smell is sweet pungent raspberry and earthy. Taste is tart, very refreshing, unabashedly raspberry. Dances the line between a fruity juice and a sour beer. Smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyed it.	4.52
1065	Atrial Rubicite	Appearance was darker than expected but everything else was just as advertised. It has plenty of raspberry flavor, but its more than a juice bomb. Subtle funk, dryness, and raspberry seeds make it a very enjoyable treat.	4.34
1066	Atrial Rubicite	This was absolutely incredible. Probably the best sour I've ever had. So much raspberry across the whole beer. This feels pretty much like having raspberry juice.	4.98
1067	Atrial Rubicite	2014 Bottle poured into plastic dixie cup.. A: Murky red body with a pink colored frothy head that settles quickly.. S: Lots of raspberry, a little vinegar and some wheat..  398 characters	4.04
1068	Atrial Rubicite	"Look: Dark red/purple with medium pink head that recedes quickly. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Jammy raspberries, lacto, Funk, and ice cream.
Taste: Lightly tart, jammy raspberries, lacto, and funk.
Mouthfeel: Medium.
Overall: A great sour from Jester King."	4.69
1069	Atrial Rubicite	I seem to find that many vaunted sours do not meet the hype. Atrial Rubicite not only meets the hype, it exceeds it. Juicy, great depth of fruit flavors, beautiful barrel character, with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel to finish. Carbonation level was spot on. So thankful I was able to try this masterpiece.	4.75
1070	Atrial Rubicite	Look: dark red with a gorgeous 1inch purple red head, dissipated quick. Smell: pure raspberry jame... this is just a raspberry bomb with a hint of funk.. Taste: light fresh raspberry with a hidden funk intertangled through out the entire beer. Could be much more raspberry forward..  430 characters	4.65
1071	Atrial Rubicite	Sour punch nose - very well done, balancing fruit and sour elements. The raspberry underpinnings mingle well with the brew and the beer stays very clean. Not too much of anything.	4.54
1072	Atrial Rubicite	Generously shared by my younger brother. Beautiful pour. Utterly stunned with the color. Dense just beautiful color. Awesome raspberry smell really fruity. Taste leaves a little bit more to be desired. I thought this would carry the fruit better like a degarde would but it has a lot of what I would call a hybrid between a fruited Belgian kriek and an American wild. It's really nice I just was hoping for more pop. Nice sour mouthfeel not too tart.. Overall I enjoyed this. Fell a little short of my expectations but still wonderful and I would recommend seeking this out.	4.37
1073	Atrial Rubicite	This review is for the 2017 July 21 release of Atrial Rubicite, ABV 5.20%. First a note, I was told by Jester King staff on July 15 that Atrial Rubicite would most likely be released in October (2017), and then they released it the next weekend. I had no way of finding out it would be released the weekend after and I don’t live in Austin (Dallas). This was annoying and complicated things for me, but I was able to make it and I was able to enjoy a couple of 8oz Atrial Rubicite at Jester King, and I also bought three 500ml bottles. The lines were a bit intimidating. It shouldn’t have to be this difficult, but in the end it was worth the trouble. This is a rare and extremely good raspberry sour (ABV 5.20% this year). I suffered for it but I love it.. Look: dark red and purple with a pink thin head.. Aroma: The aroma is raspberry..  1,062 characters	4.97
1074	Atrial Rubicite	Atrial b4. Pours a ruby red to lilac color with a smaller, pinkish head.. Smells of intriguingly ripe and juicy raspberries, which appear almost a bit jammy as for their simply powerful appearance on the nose. Its hard to get anything else than the raspberries on the nose, which, don't get me wrong, is a good problem to have..  1,268 characters	4.54
1075	Headroom	16 oz. can. Murky orange body. Smells of onions, lime zest, tropical fruit, and sweet pale malt. Taste has strong orange and lime zest. Garlic comes behind it. The zippy hop flavors linger long into the back end. Slight earthy tones and a little sweetness in the finish. Medium heavy. Drinks pretty well for its size. It's still a big beer, but it delivers on flavor.	4
1076	Headroom	Canned 08/01/19, 10:11:09.. Lightly pale golden yellow.. opaque in appearance and without much of any rising and/or settling head above the beer. Small dots of lace cling to the glass.. The nose is more hop-forward than you’d think; scallions and grassy hops, with undertones of underripe papaya and bright citrus..  688 characters	4.4
1077	Headroom	On tap at The Veil Summer Fest.. Nice orange golden hazy look with some lacing. Lots of citrus and papaya type notes in the nose, a bit zesty as well. Taste follows nose with lots of citrus flavor and a good dose of earthiness. Moderate mouthfeel due to the flaked wheat, light carbonation, construction and balance the excellence you expect from Trillium.	4.5
1078	Headroom	Pours thick and milky and golden, just what you'd expect from a well-loved Trillium beer. Smell is grass, green onion, and maaaaaybe a liiiittle citrus? But not enough for my liking. Taste is equally bitterness-forward, and doesn't match the flavors my eyes were expecting. It's nice to be reminded NEIPAs aren't all pure juice, but it also reaffirms what I like in a beer. Great for what it is, and if you like that, you will love it, it's just... not for me.	3.88
1079	Headroom	"8/17 pour at greenway.. L strong haze on pale yellow side
S little alcohol mixed with strong hop notes of pineapple and tropical fruit
T nice firm bitterness and follows the smell
Over all a great ipa was happy to see on tap"	4.54
1080	Headroom	"Can: ""Canned On 08/01/19 08:43:21"". Reviewed: 8/14/19. L: full body; thick laguna yellow appearance; .5 mm head, fast dissipating, no lacing.  414 characters"	4.56
1081	Headroom	Appearance: Arrives the usual cloudy honey color with a modest cap; spots of foam cling. Smell: Papaya, mango, melon, passionfruit and tangerine; pithy, bright and juicy aromatics. Taste: The pith assaults the tastebuds right away, letting you know this isn’t the usual NE IPA juice bomb; still, there is the progression of tropical flavors with papaya, mango and passionfruit forward -land just a hint of melon underneath; the mid-palate is all tangerine and the finish has a moderately high degree of bitterness.  754 characters	4.57
1082	Headroom	"The Epitome of a Trillium NEIPA.
L: Tropicana no pulp
S: Orange Rind, cinnamon
T: Juicy with some bitter, overall, thicc
F: Burn down the throat
O: Good stuff"	4.51
1083	Headroom	Know Trillium well but had not been able to get opportunity to get Headroom to date. This is a hyped release (once a year so far) and had burden of expectations. Happy to say this has lived up to the hype -- at least 2019 release. Poured from a can dated 8/1/19 to a Teku. Pours a hazy light yellow. Never one to linger on smell that but this one comes across right away with wafting a bright citrus. The taste is up there with best I have had. Notes of pineapple, orange..tropical as you would expect with this packed with Galaxy but no bite. Glad I got the max allotment..gonna have to let this last a while.	4.74
1084	Headroom	My first Trillium beer, have to figure out how to get more regularly!. Canned on 6/10/18, poured from can into tulip glass 10/2/18. Guessing I missed some of the highlights here but this is still a great beer. Murky orange-yellow pour with large foamy head that quickly disappears leaving a little lacing. Juicy citrus with a touch of sweetness to it on the nose. Clean, crisp taste with touch of hoppy bitterness to finish. Delicious beer, wish I was closer so I could get more of their stuff regularly.	4.71
1085	Headroom	08/2015 - Typical Trillium juiciness on the nose with orange, tangerine, and some citrus up front; notable onion on the palate with a nice sweetness, creaminess, and slightly bitter back end; the finish is clean, bright, fruity, and a touch dank.	4.5
1086	Headroom	"Serving: Can
Canned: Aug-10-2018 (Consumed Sep-9). A very Trillium-looking beer. Chalky peach flesh color with a couple fingers of airy off-white head that descends to a skiff. Ok retention with a little lacing.The smell is that of peachy BO: stone fruit, funky hop odor and general layers of greeny, almost grassy pseudo bitterness. The flavor follows with a rich, thick hop funk. Big Columbusy green bitterness with a real depth of pot-like, pine-bough flavor with some dank stone fruit notes. It has a fairly big body with a creamy feel, moderate carbonation and a lingering hoppy finish. A nice IIPA from these guys that seems to be immensely bitter without being bitter at all and quite fruity without being fruity. Lots of rich, strong hop flavor and a nice feel. Pretty much pure, concentrated hops from across the spectrum on a sugar cookie canvas. AKA a Trillium beer."	4.31
1087	Headroom	16oz can dated 8/10/18.. Pours murky gold with minimal retention or lacing. Hop and citrus tonic in the nose. Pithy grapefruit, orange, peach, and pine. Medium bodied with a slickish, oily mouthfeel. A carpet-bombing of hops on the palate. Raw hop resins with a bitter booziness. Grapefruit and candied pine. Finishes with a fairly strong throat burn and alcohol-infused hop concentrate.. What a bruiser. Old scool Trillium at its best.	4.56
1088	Headroom	2018 batch - canned 8/10. 8/23: I could understand the hype, but it was way too dank for me. It popped up in the mid palate and wiped everything else out, except for the greenness. Otherwise, it was excellent on the initial attack, with soft tropical fruits.. 9/20: I am now part of the hype. The dankness and greenness have mellowed out to allow more of the tropical fruits to pop up. Dankness is still heavy, but comes through prominently in the finish with a medium bitterness. A month's time has done this wonders, and I like it significantly more than I did when fresh.	4.75
1089	Headroom	Headroom has been a wishlist beer for a couple of years now - as with other Trillium offerings, I've only sporadically been able to nail down trades. We're only talking about IPAs here - but they can still be confoundingly difficult to locate.. Headroom, strangely, fell in to my lap via a friend. This 2018 release can was a very pleasant surprise.. The beer pours a light orange - the nose is soft and fruity and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is rich - in a blind test, I might very easily misidentify this beer as a milkshake IPA. It's surprisingly, really - it's just super thick and yeasty and malty. It's also tremendously sweet and soft, which I think may be the unfortunate source of the slight lingering and unpleasant aftertaste. It could definitely use a bit of a cleaner finish. I'd also have to add that it's just a bit boozy - the ABV isn't really discernible per se, but it's certainly a little hotter than your standard 8% IPA. I like, and do not like, this about the beer. I'd really like it to be a little more sessionable..  1,274 characters	4.5
1090	Headroom	"Canned 5 days ago.. L — Pours that nice orange juice haze that is characteristic of Trillium. A little less milky than I was expecting. Finger of white head dissipates fairly quickly, leaving spotty lacing
S — Phew! This one’s up there with DDH Congress. Pineapple, mango, orange, peach, papaya, guava, kumquat, berry, lime zest, earthen resin
T — Very intense hop character on this one, backed up by a fairly sweet pale malt profile. More like hop candy than hop juice: candied pineapple, dried mango, dried apricot, candied citrus peel. Also getting lots of earthen bitterness. After just a couple of sips my palate was already blown out.
F — Big mouthfeel, medium carb. The hop bitterness is pretty intense and unlike most of Trillium’s hoppy offerings, the resinous mosaic bitterness really sticks around on the finish. Less syrupy than their other intensely hopped offerings (esp. Big Bird and All Hundred Thousand Trillion Everything), which is a definite plus
O — This is a tasty, intensely hopped DIPA from Trillium that avoids many of the pitfalls of the majority of their DIPAs. The hops are definitely a bit excessive, and this certainly isn't as good as some of their more mild galaxy-hopped releases (especially DDH Congress and Galaxy Fort Point). Very good clarity of flavors, though. 91/100"	4.53
1091	Headroom	2018 batch. Much more drinkable right away than last year. The 2017 batch was hop burn overload. This even looks more hazy and fluffy than last year. The smell is amazing. I liken it to Perm 32. Pineapple and mango overload. It smells so incredibly juicy that it could be passed off as a smoothie in look and smell. Taste is great. A lot like 32, but with less sweetness and more hop bite. Loads of tropical fruit, as well as oranges galor. There’s definitely a bite here, but it’s not as overpowering as last year’s batch. Overall really enjoyed this. It’s not topping 32 or even Galaxy Cutting Tiles, but Trillium has been putting out amazing IPAs all year and this is no different.	4.64
1092	Headroom	"This beer was fantastic,
I am absolutely shocked that this doesn't have a better rating than 57? This is hands down one of the top 5 hoppiest beers I have ever had - Hop Heads rejoice!"	4.78
1093	Headroom	L: beautiful beer. A combination or orange and pineapple juice look. Clear head that goes away. Probably the only drawback.. S: huge pineapple smell. Citrus fruit. Balanced hops.. T: wow. So balanced. The fruit and hop flavors melt together. Nothing overpowered by the other..  397 characters	4.69
1094	Headroom	Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass (~1 month old). Smell is a ton of bright/green hop flavor and citrus with notes of orange pulp, pineapple, tropical fruit, resin and oats.. Taste has even more hop flavor than expected with some nice spice coming through in the finish. Sweetness and bitterness are low to moderate. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a nice surge of carbonation on the finish (crisp). It is soft but nor as much as some others in the style.. Overall this is maybe my favorite ipa from Trillium. It is a nice complement to their more balanced DIPA, Heavy Mettle. Headroom is just an explosion of hop flavor. It has mellowed nicely over a month and actually is quite balanced for a hop bomb. Either way, seek it out if you love hops.	4.79
1095	Headroom	This was absolutely incredible. Hops were absolutely incredible, creamy mouthfeel, the aroma just bursts out as soon as I opened the can. Pineapple notes all over.	4.94
1096	Headroom	It pours the color of Orangina and has a hazy neon glow. Not as opaque and cloudy as some reviews indicate, though.. The nose is more subtle than I expected but I got some notes of pineapple juice and ripe mango.. My first impression upon sipping is that this beer is thinner than I ever thought it might be. Pineapple soda and peach candy lead into a dank bready presence before an even danker resinous piny weed finish..  719 characters	3.67
1097	Headroom	L: Cloudy grapefruit juice. S: Fruity and floral. T: Dank and bitter with tropical fruit notes, all melding into one..  299 characters	4.59
1098	Headroom	L - Orange milkshake with a finger of white head. S - hop resins and oils, grapefruit, dankness, pine, black pepper, cedar, blueberry. T - Wonderful combo of tropical fruits and dankness..  317 characters	4.58
1099	Headroom	A 16 oz. can dated 8-11-17 poured into a tulip.. Appearance- looks like a mix of pineapple and orange juice. Definitely a thick fruit bomb. About a finger of light white head that disappeared quickly. No noticeable lacing.. Smell- an interesting mix of tropical fruit with galaxy hops. Something tart in it but not certain what..  772 characters	4.71
1100	Double Galaxy	"On-tap at Hops Hill, Brooklyn, NY. A: The beer is very hazy to cloudy dark yellowish white in color. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that left lots of thick lacing down the sides of the glass and a thin webbing of bubbles on the surface.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of grapefruit citrus are present in the nose along with hints of peaches.
T: The taste follows the smell and has strong flavors of citrusy hops - grapefruit stands out in particular - along with notes of stone fruit and hints of peaches. There is also a moderate to high amount of bitterness that lingers into the finish.
M: It feels medium-bodied, a little crisp, and somewhat juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is very impressive for a single hop IPA as it is aromatic, flavorful, and bitter with hardly any traces of alcohol. It is an absolute hop bomb.. Serving type: on-tap"	4.43
1101	Double Galaxy	Huge head as I had kicked the keg. Slow to recede leaving lots chunky lace in the form of blankets and thick streaks. The liquid is milkshake cloudy with white hued lemon color.. Spicy and floral hop aroma. The malt smell is neutral and certainly lighter than the hop.. Dry malt start which enhances the strength of the bittering hops. The body is average with an elevated carbonation level. There's a strong alcohol presence. The finish is astringent and bitter but not in an extreme way. Soft lingering aftertaste.	4.01
1102	Double Galaxy	All about the hype but this one is a little overrated. Generous scores based on the brewery it comes out of. Was probably world class in 2011 but not so much now. It's very one dimensional.	4.14
1103	Double Galaxy	12 oz can poured into a flute glass. Very cloudy straw color, half inch white head. Nose: Dominated by hops. Citrus, tropical fruit.  274 characters	4.42
1104	Double Galaxy	"Canned 08/13/19 Drink by 09/24/19 “D.Galaxy”
Can a Galaxy hop be presented in a more impressive manner? I think not. I had forgotten how incredible this varietal can be. Or is it the talent of HF that can showcase a single ingredient in such a way with a delicious base recipe. Regardless, it’s pungent, grassy, dank, vegetal, earthy, and drinkable beyond belief. Sticky and resinous in the finish and feel with plenty of fruit as well. What a beer."	4.66
1105	Double Galaxy	Almost a typical NEIPA look but nit as murky. Aroma is delicious citrus, maybe a touch of juniper or pine, some dough. Juicy flavor, not harsh at all, drinkability is scary. My takeaway from Hill Farmstead IPA's after not having them for three years is that they are more refined and subtle than some of the stuff from Treehouse or Trillium. They capture all the right notes but they are soft and refined. I didn't think I liked Galaxy hops but this is high quality beer.	4.24
1106	Double Galaxy	"12 oz can stamped July 2 2019
Tastes great 2 1/2 weeks later
Beautiful orange glow with quickly dissipating white fizzy head.
Smells like citrus and cotton candy
Tastes like a blend of orange and grapefruit juices.
Mouthfeel is medium.
Mild bitterness on the follow.
Heavy lacing on the brandy snifter."	4.83
1107	Double Galaxy	Beautiful orange pour with a nice finger's thickness of white, creamy head. Smells terrific - lots of orange-y citrus notes. Taste is super clean with a ton of citrus, some resiny green notes, a bit of bitterness in the finish. Just excellent. Really drinkable, impossible to discern the 8% ABV. Would love to crush these by a fire.	4.39
1108	Double Galaxy	Soft gold, foamy head. Aroma has underripe melon, faint lemon, musty hop. Palate is pretty balanced, not super juicy, more earthy fruit flavors like stone fruit, maybe a little apricot, with some grassy earthy hops. Medium bitterness	4.37
1109	Double Galaxy	"First, I love Galaxy... so a bit biased. Having a HF Imp IPA doing a SH with Galaxy sounded so good. Reading reviews then placed a huge hype... made me wonder.
So delighted that I could grab a six pack when at HF last week.
Quintessential NEIPA if you like Galaxy.
Beautiful full heady pour. Hazy but not cloudy. Rich yellow towards orange. Robust fruity and dank nose. Flavor was so rich with fresh citrus and tropical fruit; sharpened with some notes of rind zest. A bit of dank bitterness increased as beer warms slightly.
Very well rounded and delicious.
Smooth and very slightly creamy; but highly light and refreshing.
Awesome IPA. More than held up to the hype."	4.68
1110	Double Galaxy	This is a just a really phenomenal beer that lives up to the hype and more. Beautiful hazy pale orange, great head and that HF lacing all the way down the glass. Earthy dank citrus grassy nose, taste is so well balanced, earthy dank grapefruit, lemon, grassy, sweet biscuity backbone. Soft, smooth, nice dry bitter finish. If I could only drink one IPA for the rest of my days it might be this one.	4.87
1111	Double Galaxy	Huge notes of dank tropical citrus, pineapple, lemony orange grapefruity citrus peel, passionfruit, yellow mango, white grape, some herbal earthy floral piney dankness, with a hint of biscuity malt character	4.8
1112	Double Galaxy	Canned on 3/4/19. Pours completely opaque light gold topped with a slight, rocky head of creamy white foam; good retention leaves huge amounts of lacing relentlessly painting the walls of the glass, as well as a minor collar of bubbly foam. About as comprehensively appealing a NEIPA I've come across.. Aromas of huge dank, herbal citrus burst from the glass, giving backing impressions of light white wine grape alongside a tropical medley that's so varied it becomes hard to define; I'm getting guava, papaya, orange, and pineapple rind, with lighter tones of passionfruit and peach skins that give way to the faintest creaminess at times. Intense, diverse, and balanced..  1,483 characters	4.42
1113	Double Galaxy	On tap at Arsmby.. Muted nose of pineapple and tropical fruits. Taste follows with pineapple and earthy dank hops and a slight tropical finish with balanced crackery sweetness . Mouthfeel is full and chewy that is reflected in the appearance with a fluffy full head. Overall it's a chewy pineapple shake.	4.38
1114	Double Galaxy	"**
03/16/19. On tap at Trenton Road; in 16 oz plastic cup.. LOOK: Pulpy thick, small head, excellent retention..  227 characters"	4.1
1115	Double Galaxy	Hazy grapefruit in the glass, a double shot of one of my favorite hop varieties. Though a single hop beer, the flavor comes at you in delicious waves. Brilliantly crafted!	4.99
1116	Double Galaxy	"On tap at Dive 106, NYC.
Pours a hazy orange color with a wispy layer of moussy head. A neat Saturn ring swirl of lacing throughout.
Aromas of candied citrus, particularly orange and tangerine. Notes of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango and papaya. Overall, the aroma hints at fruity juicy goodness to come.
As expected, a big juicy and fruity taste with notes of bright tropical and citrus fruit. A firm malt backbone is nevertheless a background for dominant hops flavors. Notes of orange cream soda and grapefruit pulp add a citrusy tanginess, while mellow tropical fruit, papaya and mango add a nice counterpoint. There are also hints of passion fruit. Earthy hops flavors add a spicy bite, resiny and redolent of sharp pine needles, as well as a developing bitterness.
Medium bodied and alternating between a crisp and fluffy mouthfeel. The carbonation is up to par. Despite the juiciness, the palate develops dryness that greatly aids drinkability. The finish is dry with hints of clean alcohol spices.
Overall, a totally kick ass IPA."	4.51
1117	Double Galaxy	Growler: Poured a hazy/cloudy yellow color ale with a huge white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrusy and tropical fruit notes with huge dank and floral undertones is just incredible. Taste is an incredible mix of dank and tropical fruit notes with some citrusy floral, subtle residual sugar with no discernible bitterness. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation. World-class beer.	4.7
1118	Double Galaxy	Can. Full-on hazy peach color with frothy off-white head with very good retention. Aroma has overripe tropical fruits, juicy hops but also some more classic herbal notes. Taste has a biscuity malt base, even slightly nutty with the hops leaning towards the herbal and grassy side. Aftertaste lingers with grapefruit rind bitterness. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Extremely drinkable DIPA with no hint of the 8% ABV. It's not a juicebomb like other hazy IPAs these days but it's very hoppy and well put together.	4.6
1119	Double Galaxy	04/2016 - As much as I love Double Citra, this is next level - just a perfect representation of my favorite hop - Galaxy! From the nose, to the palate, to the finish, this ale crushes and is easy to crush, too, despite the ABV!	4.73
1120	Double Galaxy	From can (2 weeks).. Might be the best Galaxy hopped beer I’ve had to date. Beautiful yellow-orange color with loads of frothy foam upon pour. Abundant tropical fruity aroma that follows into the taste, but without making it overly sweet like many NE IPA brewers tend to do with Galaxy hops. It’s really well balanced and clean in the finish with a good mouthfeel. It is extremely enjoyable and easy to drink. Absolutely love it.	4.92
1121	Double Galaxy	Opaque pale yellow, almost like banana puree, with a large, off-white foam that settles in thick lumps to a fuzzy collar leaving pock mark lace on glass.. This smells like a tropical fruit cup--pineapple, mango and orange--with some eucalyptus, citronella and biscuit.. Taste is surprisingly acidic for Hill Farmstead, but still quite tasty, with notes of mango, pineapple and lemon rind, but also resin and toasty biscuit..  481 characters	4.06
1122	Double Galaxy	Definitely not the same quality as I've experienced from their growler fills- but I wouldn't kick it out of bed. Last batch of TH Green kicked this one's ass and I'm not really a TH guy. Will have to get back up to the source	4.29
1123	Double Galaxy	Had this on 2018-06-04 in Columbia, PA from a fresh, 12oz can. A - Murky straw-gold with a 1-finger head that drops quickly leaving decent lace.. S - Overly ripe pineapple (a bit dank), melon, cracker, very pleasant earthy/herbal/floral spice..  555 characters	4.29
1124	Double Galaxy	"Look: Hazy yellow with turbid with big white creamy head. Has medium low carbonation.
Smell: Pineapple, grapefruit pith, lemon, and earthy pine.
Taste: Pineapple, grapefruit pith, lemon, skittles, and earthy pine.
Mouthfeel: Medium light and creamy.
Overall: A great IPA from Hill Farmstead."	4.55
1125	Supplication	Lucky enough to grab the last bottle at Brick Store Pub (ATL) for a pretty penny. Worth the money since this is unlike any beer that I have ever had. Unique base brown ale with drying vinous funk of the Pinot noir barrels. I think I prefer Saison Bernice slightly but this is essentially flawless.	5
1126	Supplication	Bottled 6/7/16; drank 5/29/17 @ the Yarchives.. Cloudy red/purple appearance; champagne bubbles throughout.. A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy khaki head; almost no lace..  434 characters	4.75
1127	Supplication	"Wow times 5! An explosive pop of the cork announces that you are in for a real treat.
Appearance: wow, it’s a beautiful red-orange color. It requires a gentle pour to prevent the head from escaping the glass.
Aroma: Wow, this could be a best selling men’s cologne! Musky, musty, earthy, funk,cedar, wine & a lot more than I can identify.
Taste: Wow, there is some much going on here. A fascinating blend of t bitter, tart & salty. Add cherries, vanilla & alcohol to those listed in the aroma to make one of the most complex flavor profiles I’ve ever tasted.
Feel: Wow, it’s the perfect blend of viscosity, carbonation & alcohol. It makes the mouth happy.
Overall: Wow, this beer is incredible! Paired with a good cheese like an aged emmi, you get a double dose of earthyness. Oh, no! My class is empty, 12 oz is not enough. Why didn’t I buy 4 or 6?"	4.84
1128	Supplication	bottled 7/21/17, consumed 9/2/19. wow, there is a lot going on here. cherry skin, minerality, earthy must, woody oak quality, mellow vanilla sweetness, vinous quality of red wine, musty grape skin. wet earth, herbaceous and slightly floral, rose petals. very mellow aciditiy hinting at some bright fruity qualities of tart apple and lemon. overall this one has a ton of depth but drinks really easy. a wonderful treat!	4.85
1129	Supplication	Presentation: 375mL brown bottle with the bottling date printed on the label. Served in a goblet.. Appearance: The thick, rocky, three finger head goes down slowly and leaves behind a lot of patchy lacing. It's a hazy, bright, reddish copper color.. Smell: It's a beautiful fruity and funky smell with notes of cherries, grapes, plums, raisins and wood..  806 characters	4.46
1130	Supplication	"Serving: Bottle
Bottled: Jul-2-2018 (Consumed Apr-16-2019). 
A:
It pours a pretty clear dirty garnet with a skiff of beige head that becomes a thin ring. Little retention; no lacing. (4). S:
Earthy, sweet, tart, funky, spiced cherries, cinnamon roll dough, old work gloves, saddle soap. (4.5).  1,323 characters"	4.52
1131	Supplication	"375 'll bottle
Cork pops
I can smell the funk and wine right away.
Amber brown pour with thin khaki head.
Not too much lacing in the tumbler.
Smells sweet and funky.
Taste starts sweet, but quickly transitions to bitter and dry.
I am getting a wood flavor from the barrel.
Overall, this is less funky than I expected, but surprisingly dry and refreshing.
The cherries add a nice tardiness too."	4.4
1132	Supplication	"375ml bottle, that was bottled on '012518'. ABV% is labeled as 7.75%.
Cloudy, medium amber colored body. Partial finger of off white head upon pouring, which quickly retreats to a partial cap and bubble fed ring. Leaves behind a few scattered spots of lacing.
At slight distance, the aroma of oak and funk waft into the nose. Upon closer examination, the sour cherry is smelled. Quite a wonderful aroma blend with the leather/horse blanket funk.
Taste is sour, with lemon, sour cherry, and Pinot Noir wine. The oak and funk join in. Funk is tobacco, leather, and horse blanket. The finish is very dry.
Medium body with a dense texture. Very good carbonation.
This beer excels as a sour, and brings forward an excellent and balanced blend of Brett, cherry, and Pinot Noir oak barrel."	4.56
1133	Supplication	July 27th, 2015 - Finally, the last Russian River taster on this long journey through the absolute unit of a taster tray served to our table. The Supplication is a relaxed auburn color, and the aroma is a bright cherry note, and I instantly fall in love. The flavor introduces vanilla, sherry and cherry with a delicious tartness, and an excellent freshness. The oak is well balanced too, making this is an excellent finish to our day marking the completion of our beer pilgrimage.	4.34
1134	Supplication	I received this from @bum4ever in the NBS BIF 8.5. Bottled on 7/2/2018 and poured from a 375 ML cork and cage bottle into a tulip glass. The color is somewhere between ruby and orange and the ecru-colored head dissipated quickly. It has a very fragrant smell of ripe cherry, oak, red wine, and brett yeast. The taste is complex: tart cherry, pinot noir, oak, and a crackery malt at the finish. The flavors are all bold but they blend very well and there is a surprising balance of sweet and sour. It finishes with a touch of bitterness. This ale is a nice, full body with lively carbonation, and it's easily drinkable at 7.75% ABV. While I am not a connoisseur of Wild Ales, I have to say that Supplication is really delicious and fun to drink.	4.49
1135	Supplication	Pours a reddish brown color with a thin foamy head. No head retention with mild to moderate lacing. Tart, smooth taste with cherries and mild red wine. Nice tart taste with cherries up front and red wine on the end. Smooth. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.	4.26
1136	Supplication	Pours a reddish-brownish orange with fine, soft head.. Smell is tart and oaky with notes of cherries, red wine, grapefruit and orange rind.. Taste is tart and funky with notes of cherries, oak and citrus. Very subtle and balanced with a dry, almost coarse finish..  414 characters	4.02
1137	Supplication	Pours a beautiful slightly hazy deep reddish amber color with a 2 finger biscuit head. Aroma is dense with red whine and oak notes. Flavor is warm oak up front quickly turning to pinot noir notes. A rich sweet malt behind it blended with the lightly sour notes is very well done. Feel is lightly soft with a moderate effervescence. This is just stupendous. Perfectly balances in all regards.	4.7
1138	Supplication	It smells phenomenal. I don’t think the taste lives up to the smell, and for the price and hype I have to say I was disappointed.. All in all a very high quality beer.	4.11
1139	Supplication	"Pours deep reddish brown. Lovely head but short lived.
After that it's all Beer vs Wine... lovely red wine notes throughout and its well sour. Cherry menthol and port--like warming alcohol without a burn. add in some nut flavours as well.
But
There is a complexity to this I haven't had before in any sour. The port notes and the smooth mouthfeel are soooo different."	4.75
1140	Supplication	2017 vintage. Rating #400 for me on BA.. Pours deep red with a thin off-white head.. The nose is cherry, cranberry, and funk..  257 characters	4.42
1141	Supplication	Pours a dark reddish brown with a quickly receding off white head. Nose is tart sour cherry. Taste follows with a definite red wine influence. Definitely the 2nd best wild ale I've tasted next to RR Consecration.	4.43
1142	Supplication	"Served from a bottle into a flute at Toronado Bar in San Francisco; produced in 2018
A: Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights and an off white head, displaying moderate retention and solid lacing.
S: Tart with aromas of cherries, pinot noir grapes, and vanilla. Lacto clearly present.
T: Tangy with flavors following the aromas fairly closely. Earthier, woodier, with an ?old leather note.
M: Substantive mouthfeel. Full bodied with beautifully persistent effervescence.
O: Despite consuming this very early, it presented very complex and mature flavor characteristics. Would love to be able to get this back home."	4.74
1143	Supplication	Look: It pours brown with a slightly off white head. Head retention is moderately good.. Smell: The first impression is a winy, sour aroma. It is followed by cherries and leather. There is also a bit of a barnyard impression.. Taste: There are flavors of cherries and leather with a moderate vinous quality. There are some wood like qualities to it. There are low levels of malt in the background. It has a very faint hint of smoke..  710 characters	4.39
1144	Supplication	Bottled on: 01-25-18. Look - Mid-brown with a reddish hue. 1 finger head with pour from a 375ml bottle. Head dissipates - as expected with an aged sour. Stays active with some bubble streams for quite some time.. Smell - Hoped for a more pungent aroma. Cherry, vanilla, wood, almond, tobacco, hint of vinegar..  1,314 characters	4.54
1145	Supplication	06/2014 - Huge cherry, oak, some cinnamon, and notable wine aromas; sour, woody, chewy body with lingering sweetness and cherries; tart finish that lingers, with cherry, too.	4.31
1146	Supplication	"Pours a deep ruby brown color, minimal foam head. Cherry / raspberry aroma. Tart and slightly sweet, ample sour cherry flavor, light oak on the dry finish. Overall very enjoyable.. 8/13/18
375 ml bottle dated 1/28/18 - thanks Adam
4.5 rating"	4.38
1147	Supplication	375 mL bottle into a wine since no tulip glass was available. The beer pours a light copper color with amber tint. Opacity is hazy, partially due to the chill, and partially due to a poor pour on my part – I likely stirred up the layer of spent-yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle during my far-too-vigorous pour. Carbonation is light in density, but heavy in quantity. 1-inch head dissipates very quickly, giving way to very lively bubbles in the center of the glass that persist throughout the tasting. First smell yields obvious fermented fruits; among them cherry, raspberry, and perhaps a bit of wild plum. Upon taking my first sip, I let the liquid wash over the entirety of my tongue to feel the light pricks of carbonation. The drying sourness is quite powerful. The flavor is similar to the nose, beginning with tart cherries leading to a warming sensation that blends well with a touch oak at the back of the tongue. As the flavor develops, I detect a slight malty sweetness that I didn’t notice on the nose. The oak and malt slowly mature into an earthy effervescence in the back of the mouth. This flavor is ephemeral, but the bubbly sensation continues to play at my tongue even long after the swallow.	4.45
1148	Supplication	"Bottled 2/27/17. Pours a clear brownish-red with a light tan head that sticks around. Spotty lace.
Aroma is must and dark cherry, earthy funk and a tannins.
Taste is tart cherry with red wine, a touch of sweet plum, a bit of astringent tree nut and a little funk. Very dry.
Mouthfeel is bubbly, dry and acidic sharpness.
This is packed with flavor."	4.44
1149	Supplication	Pours somewhat brownish red in appearance, to be honest not entirely pleasing to the eye.. Strong tart cherry and wine barrel tannic notes, oak, and musty funk.. Bretty, musty, funky, oaky, vinous, cherry..  460 characters	4.24
1150	Cable Car	2018 vintage, drank 8/1/2019. Pours orange with a bit of suspended matter. Tons of funk to the nose and taste. Quite sour and acetic. I for some reason had been expecting a kriek - but this is quite good all the same. I'd love to try an aged bottle.	4.5
1151	Cable Car	"Bomber from tornado lightly chilled
Cork pops like bubbly
Pours a clear gold with nice white foamy head
Smells like chardonnay.
There is a funky grape juice aroma.
Head dissipates quickly.
Taste explodes in my mouth. More funky grape. It starts sweet, but ends dry. The beer has a nice body and is not too heavy or cloying..
Not tasting the wood from the barrel.
Creamy buttery chardonnay comes through in the end in a good way. I am glad I tried it and enjoy it, but do not need to spend $80 again for it."	4.48
1152	Cable Car	Poured into a tulip glass. Avery clear golden color with a medium white head. Aroma was as white wine, lemon, and stone fruit. The taste followed with a tart cherry flavor and floral notes. A clean dry backbone. Overall a fantastic beer.	4.49
1153	Cable Car	At last, I got to try this one. The hallmark of this one is the complexity. There are layers upon layers of sour fruit, wood, mineral earthiness, dank funk, and acidic fruits. The smell is a fruity horse blanket, with plenty of musk and funk to go around. Carbonation is a little high, but otherwise wonderful in the feel. A well made beer that stands the test of time	4.39
1154	Cable Car	05/2016 - 2014 vintage - No effs given about the price for on-site consumption as this beer is truly complex, multi-layered, and beautiful. Semi-sweet, oak, funky, nice tartness; balanced.	4.65

Reviewed as: American Wild Ale
Misc.: N/A. Saw that Toronado would be tapping this gem Thursday earlier in the week as part of Toronado’s 10th anniversary and things worked out where I could sneak over from work after lunch. Had no idea of the price until I paid. Really didn’t know the size of the glass either, initially thinking eight ounces then later thinking six. Either way, this beer was supposed to be a stud, coming in at No. 55 all-time on Beer Advocate. Scanning the QR code on their website after the fact, it read, “Good luck! We produced this limited release barrel aged sour blended beer for the 20th anniversary of the Toronado in San Francisco. A whopping 35 cases were made.”. Poured a golden clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy off-white head when I got it. Some bubbles creeping up from the bottom of the glass. World-class spotty lacing. World-class retention. Really great looking beer for a sour. (Sight - 4.50).  1,664 characters"	4.5
1156	Cable Car	2016 vintage drank out of a bottle at Toronado SF on 9/25/2017. Look-minimal head and decent lacing for a sour. Super light and translucent golden body. Smell-citrus and Apple and some oak. Not overly complex but really enjoyable.  545 characters	4.57
1157	Cable Car	"750ml cork top bottle poured into a snifter
2014 vintage. A- pours a clear golden color with a small creamy white head that has short retention and leaves a ring around the edge. S- super tart vinegar and and funk up front with fruity notes of ripe pear, citrus, cheese ride, lemon zest & toasted wheat.  704 characters"	4.5
1158	Cable Car	2013 bottle poured in a DDG teku. Semi hazy golden color. Smells of funk, subtle vinegar. Taste is amazing...insanely balanced. Perfect tartness....super drinkable. Excellent carb. Overall an outstanding beer that lived up to the hype for me.	4.74
1159	Cable Car	2013 vintage poured into a Lost Abbey Teku.. Aromas are oak and spices, citrus, fruity wild yeast, and overripe fruits.. On the tongue is citrus and lactic, funky, wine, oak, followed by dry tannins, oak aftertaste, green apple. Mildly dry aftertaste. High carbonation with a nice easy drinking body..  424 characters	4.68
1160	Cable Car	Cable car 2014 on 180617. Pours a brighter golden-yellow color with a small, yet stable white head.. Offers a mineralic apple sweetness, which gets balanced by old cheese, cellar funk and a lovely hay softness. Atop of this settles lime zest, making this quite sour on the nose, together with lots of old leather and some malt sweetened moldy woodbark. This is definitely more funky than acidic with an unforseen richness of aromas, due to the well enveaved malt sweetness, amping everything else up by a few notches..  1,855 characters	4.43
1161	Cable Car	One rating down due to supply and demand. No distribution but in-house consumption only. I managed to be one of the luckiest to be able to take one home. Best one so far.	4.7
1162	Cable Car	"2016 vintage. Had on draft at Lost Abbey 10th Anniversary party, May 21, 2016. Writing review on notes I took that day.
L: golden color, ever-so-slightly cloudy, big white foamy head
S: somewhat muted at first since I was drinking this outside, but as it warmed and I went inside the aroma really shined through. Lemon, peach, apricot, pear, funk minor white grape. The funkiness was singular and one I had never smelled before. Very enjoyable aroma!
T: Taste was great also. Lemon and stone fruits were the headliners here along with that uncommon and nice funkiness.
F: Mouthburst was subtle and not sharp at the end, so it was nice-drinking throughout.
O: It was difficult to finally grab this, especially without having to pay the Toronado prices, but it was well worth the effort! One of my all time favorite sours, easily! Very high class!"	5
1163	Cable Car	Right in line with some of the best sours out there. Great taste and feel, but didn't get an outstanding smell from it. Nothing bad, just didn't blow my socks off. Overall, very glad to have tried this one out.	4.45
1164	Cable Car	This is worth all of the hype. I bought a vintage 2008 bottle about a month ago when I was at Toronado in SF, and I was not disappointed. For an 8 year old beer, this was incredible complex.	4.75
1165	Cable Car	What a great surprise to get to try this at Toronado during Duck Days of Summer. 2016 Vintage. Poured into a goblet, it is a beautiful golden/orange color with a slight haze, and 1 finger of head. Smells was most stone fruit, peaches, apricots, a bit of lemon. Big creamy body with the right amount of dryness, acidity (mild), and tart & funk. I know they price point turns some folks off, but I considered this a treat and a beer I'd probably never have again so $60 seemed well worth it to me. If I do get another chance to drink this again, I won't hesitate.	4.77
1166	Cable Car	Not a big sour person, but there beer was very enjoyable. Great hazy orange color and look. Flavor was smooth with more funk than sour for me. Could actually enjoy this very often. 2016 vintage	4.37
1167	Cable Car	Slightly overrated (especially for what it costs!), but it's still a fantastic beer. I actually found Duck Duck Gooze to be vastly superior to this one.	4.31
1168	Cable Car	Poured from the bottle at Toronado in San Diego on 5/26/16. 2009 release.. Appears a vibrant, hazy orange. Aroma is complex with layers of peach, apricot, pear, white grape, lemon, lime... definitely fruit forward tinged with woodsy barrel notes. Flavor is highly complex - this has aged super well. Again there is a melange of stone fruit flavors balanced with tartness and funk and just the right amount of acidity. Very drinkable, yet at the same time it's totally a sipping beer due to the multiple layers of flavor. Smooth and zippy with a pleasing, fine carbonation fully intact.. If forced to choose I would pick this over DDG.	5
1169	Cable Car	Had this 2014 version. This beer tasted great, I'd still take duck duck over it, but man what a great beer. Great funk, great smell, great taste. I'd gladly drink this one over and over again	5
1170	Cable Car	I've only had 2012 CC, but it was the best BA AWA I've had....absolutely extraordinary stuff...so complex and amazing. Layers of fruit and funk, but neither was overpowering.	4.91
1171	Cable Car	Had at Toronado (SF) yesterday, served at perfect temperature.. L: clear, brownish dark yellow. S: predominantly fresh peach and apricot..  386 characters	4.55
1172	Cable Car	"Mild orange color, solid 1"" of white head on it. Aroma was tart lemons, funk, astringent oak.. Taste was very sour, more lemon notes, more clean wood. Very similar to duck duck gooze. Hides alcohol well, plenty of carbonation and levity. Pucker inducing.. Another very good beer from Lost Abbey, but the scarcity business model is tired and realistically affects a beer score."	4.6
1173	Cable Car	A very nice sour but count me in the camp of rarity builds some hype in this one. Plenty of other comprable sours at a far lower price point that are easier to acquire.	4.14
1174	Cable Car	2014 bottle shared in an American Wild Ale blind-tasting with two others.. I've heard a lot of comments that Cable Car is good but isn't worth what it takes to land. I disagree. It truly lived up to the hype, and was a clear winner and standout in the blind-tasting.. It's slightly hazy with a big body/mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Loads of tangerines and mandarin oranges on the nose and taste. A nice lively and yet soft feel. Perfect acidity - not overly sour and balances well with the funk, which it had plenty of..  716 characters	4.78
1175	Citra	Pours a semi clear amber with fine head.. Smell is piney with notes of resin, grapefruit an grapefruit rind.. Taste is piney and citrus with a strong, resiny bitterness. There is a medicinal hint that hampers it somewhat and makes it a little bit astringent..  369 characters	4.06
1176	Citra	Bottled 11/2/16; drank 12/5/16 @ the Palace.. Semi-opaque dull orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a huge off-white head; frothy lace..  378 characters	4.25
1177	Citra	02/2015 - Pineapple and mango fosho with mild pine, dank aromas; fruity, juicy, nice hoppy tang, tropical fruits on the palate; sweet, wee bitter, clean finish though.	4.44
1178	Citra	Golden, slightly hazy with no visible cardio and a finger of white head.. Smells of pineapple, citrus and a hint of pine. A Caramel malty backbone follows.. Tastes of perfection in balance. Fruity and floral almost like a rose, lily of the valley. Caramel sweetness with a hint of bitterness like grapefruit pith..  596 characters	4.45
1179	Citra	Well, here is it: other than Emily Didonato lying at the foot of my bed - this is my number 1 want: Kern River Citra.. As I sip I am jolted from a dream - is this real? Am I? First textures are lush and grassy like Warren Beatty trying to woo Natalie Wood. Unfortunately, what comes after it is not Disneyland every night at 9:30 PM - no fireworks. I’m missing that extra hoorah! I’m missing that extra zoom zoom in the boom boom! It’s nice and clean, but then like my 4th ex, it’s kind of one dimensional. It’s ok, but because of the hype going into it, I kind of haz a sad.	4
1180	Citra	"Awesome!
Golden with white head. It glows.
Awesome citra smell and super choppy taste. Rivals the alchemists. Gets a bit bitter as I make my way through the glass. 16 oz draft."	4.61
1181	Citra	Surprised by the haze, it's a nearly fully opaque orange-amber with a lighter gold around the bottom edge, topped with a large khaki foam that slowly settles to a thin film with a bubbly clinging collar.. Smell actually starts garlicky and biscuity, with some sharp yeast, orange zest and rind, lemon and pine.. Taste is tangy and almost spicy with a mix of allium and citrus, backed by a sting of pine and a biscuity rug with a Triple Sec finish..  660 characters	3.77
1182	Citra	On-draught at Verdugo Bar, Los Angeles. I've waited a long time to try this one.. 30cl for $8 USD. 8% ABV. Imperial IPA.. Pours a glowing orange body of average vibrance. No yeast or lees are visible. Head is white, coating, and thick. Head retention is good for the high ABV - ~8 minutes. Leaves scattered lacing on the sides of the glass as the head recedes..  2,181 characters	3.84
1183	Citra	Had on tap at KRBC. Unremarkable head at beginning...but stunning rich amber honey color... and outstanding lacing. Full hop aroma and a citrus bomb for flavor. So clean and drinkable. Reamarkabke easy for an 8% DIPA. Definitely built in the malts perfectly. Yep... lived up to the hype.	4.42
1184	Citra	Having on draft in a pint glass. Dark amber color with a slight haze and one finger head. Smells of burnt caramel and toasted orange rind. Totally full bodied with creamy carbonation texture. Flavors of roasted pineapple, peach with toasted orange rind bitterness. Long lasting fruit sweetness and bitterness.	4.25
1185	Citra	L: Pours a beautiful golden color. 2 fingers of foamy head with good retention.. S: Wonderful aroma of tropical fragrances, floral aromas, and just enough pine to let you know this is a West Coast style IPA.. T: A nice combination of fruity flavors with a delicious piney Hop residue on the back end..  566 characters	4.59
1186	Citra	"Best IPA I've ever had. I waited years to finally get a case of Citra and the wait was worth it. Scary drive to the brewery to pick up the case, but it was a fantastic trip. Numerous great beers but Citra stood out. Actually, they had ""Hazy Citra"" on tap and it was wonderful. If you get a chance to try it, don't pass it up."	4.81
1187	Citra	Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Teku goblet.. Look- A deep murky orange with a little over a finger of thick white head. A small amount of lacing down the glass.. Smell- Lots of strong citrus with an awesome touch of pineapple. Made me want to hurry for my first drink..  659 characters	4.81
1188	Citra	A: bright glowing orange. Slight haze. Thick eggshell white bubbles. S: citra galore. Resin. Citrus pith. Notes of pineapple and mango peel.. T: great balance of tropical fruits and citrus zest. Goes into resinous pine and a floral arrangement..  402 characters	4.23
1189	Citra	I traveled 2 hours to grab a case of this after I learned about it from a friend. I had to make an advanced purchase online to be eligible for picking it up directly from KRBC. While there I grabbed a couple of pints from the tap.. My first reaction: holy moley! Smooth and extremely drinkable without harsh bitterness despite the hoppiness. It is everything you want in a double IPA. My only regret is that I didn't buy 5 more cases of it. I guess i'll just need to count down to the next release.	4.93
1190	Citra	My local dealer hooked me up with this one. I am no stranger to whales but i honestly had never heard of this brew before my buddy mentioned it.. Poured into a stien, has an off-white head about 1 inch thick. Color is golden/amber with a haze. I dont know about others but there is just something about hazy IPAs that I love.. The nose is filled with powerful citrus and pineapple flavors. Very smooth up front for a DIPA..  698 characters	4.63
1191	Citra	This was such a highly rated beer, with a previous lottery system, and I was excited to have finally gotten it. I liked it but was a bit disappointed. Look was dark and clear. Smell was pretty weak in comparison to the other strong citra-dominant beers that are out there now. The taste was a lot more balanced between the citra tropical juiciness and the sharper piney bitterness. Was expecting the citra to be more prominent. Mouthfeel was like any other regular IPA. Not bad, but not good. Overall, it was a good beer, but did not live up to my expectations, especially since there are so many newly-popular hazy citra bombs out there now. Worth having, but won't make the tough effort to have again.	3.99
1192	Citra	"Look: golden yellow light white head about .5 inches
Smell: tropical fruit, big bitter hops, light malt and ethanol... Citra hop bomb
Taste: same as nose just more bitter and less floral
Feel: super dry and bitter"	4.39
1193	Citra	Pours a light orange color with a soapy head. Aroma is dank and tropical, with herb and fruity scents.. In the taste, strong citrus and pineapple flavors with some resin and bitterness backing it up. Mango, orange, pine, onion, and herb. Bitter finish with a light malt profile. Full bodied ale. Overall, this is a solid double IPA.	4.21
1194	Citra	Juicier than west coast IPAs traditionally tend to be. Brings the malt backbone that is characteristic of West Coast IPAs, imparting additional caramel sweetness. Overall very solid, but for me at least, I prefer the newer trend of hazy, juicy IPAs coming out of places in New England, from Tired Hands, and, for example, from Monkish on the left coast.	3.75
1195	Citra	While this is a great example of a good west-coast double IPA, I don't know that I agree with the consensus so far in that it's top 50 worthy. The flavor was solid, but nothing over the top like some others, and the mouthfeel was pretty standard for a high quality IPA. Glad I tried it, but won't be rushing out to get it again.	4.18
1196	Citra	This is a very well made beer, but from talking with friends, the citrus profile falls off quickly. Well balanced with a small amount of citrus, but dominated by the dank/bittering hops.	4.09
1197	Citra	22 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Bottled on date on the case 11/11/16.. Pours a cloudy pale gold color with a one-inch white head which dissipates into a fine lacing.. The nose is all citra hops with a big bouquet of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and orange peel. No real malt presence at all here. It doesn't bring the all-out assault of hops that some DIPAs do, but there is plenty of depth and nuance..  993 characters	4.5
1198	Citra	"Finally get to try this one...thanks Jason!. A: Pillowy white head that holds on forever over a deep golden slightly cloudy beer. A little chill haze but filtered.
S: Wonderful balance of light malt and hops. The citra really shines here; a little ethanol is hidden by big citrus.
T: At first it seems like a lot of other West Coasters...a little ethanol, lovely malt balance but big and surprisingly resinous. I was not expecting how dank it is given the name. More lemon rind with a bit of stonefruit at the beginning that yields to more pine that sticks around for days. Kind of a perfect finish.
M: Light for how much flavor is packed in here; not thin at all but so balanced...carbonation is way in the background and lets the sticky lupulin come through.
O: So stoked to finally try this legend and I'm not disappointed. Like many folks my tastes have changed a lot in the last year or two with the prevalence of North East IPAs, but this one will stand the test of time no matter what the fad. Easy to drink and packed with all the flavors you could want from an IPA."	4.58
1199	Citra	Excellent DIPA.. Light caramel in color. Small head. Smell is very tropical and fruity. Taste is similar. Nice hop bitterness to finish. Spot on mouthfeel.. Overall, excellent DIPA. Not the hazy juice bombs of the east coast but excellent nonetheless.	4.35
1200	Framboise Du Fermier	750ml Bottle at share. Cloudy watermelon color, sparse bubbly head. Tart, sweet aroma, lots of berry. Taste is strawberry with a bit of melon . Sweet and tart.	4.1
1201	Framboise Du Fermier	"L: Pours a bright ruby red that recedes into a slight cloudy cranberry hue with a light pink foam and ample lacing
S: Jam and fruit preserves and fresh raspberries on the nose with a hint of funk
T: Fulsome sweet jammy fruit upfront complemented with a robust (yet balanced) Side Project acidity and touch of oak; tart finish
F: Superbly even and smooth mouthfeel with a crisp saison dryness on the finish
O: Been sitting on this one for awhile and finally popped it open on a 90 degree afternoon. Just a stunning pour followed by a robust jammy goodness. Really well done and perfect for a late summer day."	4.75
1202	Framboise Du Fermier	WAY too damn sour, puckering to say the least. Raspberries are normally one of my personal favorites added to a sour but this is utterly acidic and rough. Cant say I'd go after this again. not my jam and the side project label is what is carrying this in my opinion.	3.67
1203	Framboise Du Fermier	while the side project wild beers have certainly been tending more acidic over the least year or so, in some instances, i think the higher acidity really works, and this is a great example of that. another one of the fruited fermier beers, up there with my favorites in the series, the plum, the cherry, and the blueberry, and i think the clean sourness that ramps up towards the end is part of what makes it. there is a lot of fruit in here, and a serious jammy sweetness is contributed by the raspberries, so the sour almost works to enhance and balance it, and with all the oak this has on it, along with the lemony funk, the drying cereal grain base, and the obvious maturity, its a complex and balanced brew that delivers what it seems to promise. i am not sure if this was aged in wine barrels or not, but it sure seems like it was, some notes of red and black currant in here, a tart cherry thing, and even a light strawberry thing, they all make it seem vinous to me, so does all the tannins in here. i even get trace watermelon flesh, juicy fruit gum, and red wine vinegar. suffice it to say there is quite a bit of depth to this. the fruit is insanely natural, really forward, and expressed beautifully through this base saison. almost as intense as i remember them being in the raspe, although i know this has to be less per barrel right? i also like it being a little stronger here, seems to slow me down, allow it to warm and open, and cut some of the flavor intensity with a little palate clearing alcohol. brilliant stuff, good carbonation too, especially compared to a few of the others in the series. the beat goes on for side project!	4.46
1204	Framboise Du Fermier	Bottle pour.. Pink raspberry color. Pink hued white head. This one has a ton of fresh, tart raspberries and a huge raspberry seed flavor. A little jammy, but mainly tart with some sourness.	4.34
1205	Framboise Du Fermier	Wow the smell on this beer is just heavenly. Full of fresh raspberries, full of tartness and sweetness. Basically liquid raspberry in pure sour saison form. Has all of the complex and beautifully balanced flavors and feel from the original, but now has a fresh fruit to star up front. Mouthfeel finish did feel a little grainy and acidic on the end, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.	4.73
1206	Framboise Du Fermier	"B2 shared on 8-19-18(Fermier Day). Pours on the lighter shade of ruby(it was the lightest shade compared with Quetsche, Kriek, and Bluet). Nice raspberry funk on the nose. An initial raspberry flavor hits the palate, but for some strange reason quickly fades as my acidic ""woo"" reaction kicks in. I've read so many reviews here with the same ""jam/jammy"" comments, and I was very disappointed when I finally got to try this coveted brew, because those 2 words are far from the truth. Jam is sweet, something you put on bread(or crackers if you really want to be Mr. Fancy Pants). This beer is strongly acidic, dare I say overly so."	4.22
1207	Framboise Du Fermier	B2 Bottle at Fermier Day. Pours a ruby red berry juice with thin pinkish head that dissipates quickly. Nose is bright juicy strawberries, raspberries, cherries. Gettin some dry tannins and oak. Taste is straight fruit juice, raspberry jam. Overall, this knocks it out. Not overly complex, straight fruit juice, but that's not really a knock. Delicious.	4.73
1208	Framboise Du Fermier	Easily the best I've ever had from Side Project. It's fantastic, and the raspberries shine through perfectly. It also strikes a great balance between its tartness and its drinkability.	4.77
1209	Framboise Du Fermier	Some of Side Projects finest! Had this alongside a 2011 Cantillon LPF and this was better. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!	4.96
1210	Framboise Du Fermier	Can't help but notice the beautiful color of this brew first. A bright red, almost pink hue w excellent carb bubbles dancing the drunken dance they do. I love atrial, and it's natural to compare the 2 brews, but this can go toe to toe with it most certainly! Be prepared for that tart doe, loved how it felt.	4.77
1211	Framboise Du Fermier	Shared from a 750 at the cellar. A Beautiful beer with strong fruit nose, a wonderful balance of tartness. As it warms up it gets better. Reminded me of my Aunt Edna jarring her own jelly in the kitchen when I was a kid. Phenomenal.	4.8
1212	Framboise Du Fermier	Tasted this as part of a fruited Fermier set. The nose promised an acidic affair, but was quite soft upon tasting. This was my second favorite fruited Fermier to the Abricot. A really nice beer, but perhaps its rarity is driving up ratings a bit.	4.58
1213	Framboise Du Fermier	The nose on this was absolutely incredible. Huge punch in your face of raspberries, raspberries, and yup, more raspberries. Cold it was more raspberry juice, the saison side only really shined as it warmed up. I really think though that fruited wild ale, like Atrial, is better than fruited saison. Beautiful beer, but I still prefer Saison du Fermier over this.	4.81
1214	Framboise Du Fermier	750 B1. Huge thanks to Matt for opening this one. Incredible raspberry nose. Amazing. Taste is mildly sour for a SP, raspberry and lemon. Very balanced. No harsh acidity. Truly amazing stuff.	4.58
1215	Framboise Du Fermier	Super intense raspberries on the nose and taste. Just explodes all over the palate. As if the raspberries weren't enough, the carbonation is lively and the prickly sensation is like pop rocks candy on the tongue. Maybe get some subtle hints of lemon and oak, but the sour raspberry jam overwhelms everything else. This was quite the experience, but wouldn't want to drink a lot of it.	4.5
1216	Framboise Du Fermier	The perfect beer. Don't drink too cold! Once it warms up / reaches ~50F it opens up and balances perfectly. Tons and tons of fruit in the nose. Super jammy, starts as a sour, when warmed opens up as a saison. Fantastic brew.	5
1217	Framboise Du Fermier	Part of a share in Pittsburgh. Pours deep red without much head. Aroma of huge jammy raspberries, acidic funk, a bit of yeast and wheat malts. Flavor is full of jammy raspberries, over the top, in a good way. There isn't much from the amazing base beer left here, but I'm not complaining. The raspberries are so plentiful, this thing is amazingly delicious. Mostly a sour, less a saison, but altogether one of the best beers I've ever had. Reminds me a bit of Atrial, but this might be slightly better. Get it if you can.	4.77
1218	Framboise Du Fermier	Poured from a bottle into a FW snifter, 4oz pour next to '14 Framboos. This was everything I could have ever imagined in a Framboise. Heavy, jammy raspberries all through the nose and taste. Sharp, effervescent saison base. Great balance, the super-fruit juice with the dry rustic wine barrel funked up saison.	4.86
1219	Framboise Du Fermier	750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Deep pink/purple body. Hazy. Small white head. Raspberry and white wine. Almost all raspberry. Some yeast that reminds you its a saison. Sharp sourness. Sour raspberry. Some raspberry sweetness. A little bit musty. White wine finish. Medium light. A bit too sour for me. The raspberry flavor is good, but it dominates everything. Missing some of the quality of the base beer.	3.9
1220	Framboise Du Fermier	On tap at HF FOFA 2015. Batch 3. HF Taster glass.. Opaque burgundy with generous, large bubbled head. Mouth puckering with loads of raspberry and super funky. A delicious sour, though quite heavy on the sourness. A notch below Saison du Fermier.	4.5
1221	Framboise Du Fermier	Deep purplish red color. Very nice carb level and retention. Huge raspberry nose with some lemon and funk. The best fruited wild I've had. Wonderful integration. The Saison du Fermier base shines with loads of tartness and microflora but the finish is fresh raspberry. Wonderful beer.	5
1222	Framboise Du Fermier	Fresh picked raspberry on the nose fresh but morphed into a barnyard wild nose. A lot of raspberry tart on the taste needed with the side project saison taste. Finish was a lot rough, but hard to complain. Fantastic beer.	4.79
1223	Framboise Du Fermier	Absolutely stunning looking beer. Smell is rich and fruity. Nice raspberry flavor, a bit rough around the edges. Good, but not on the level of the apricot version.	4.36
1224	Framboise Du Fermier	Multiple sample pours at the 2015 HF Festival of Farmhouse Ales. Pours a beautiful red/ruby color. Lot of raspberries and oak in the smell. Taste was very acidic and seemed to overpower the other things going on with the beer which prevented this from being rated higher.	4.32
1225	Focal Banger	Pours out mildly hazy orange yellow. A finger and a half of white foam a very nice looking pour.. Nose is pithy grapefruit, some sweet pineapple, citrus, floral notes.. Taste is mild bitterness up front. Grapefruit comes in first. Lingers for quite a while not leaving room for much else. Bitterness stays quite some time as well. Eventually fades to a miniscule malt profile. I don't know...this seems kind of linear. Not a lot of depth. Maybe I'm not getting this one..  801 characters	4.02
1226	Focal Banger	Pale yellow in color with a hazy complexion. Plenty of lacing on my glass. There’s a quarter inch of dishwater white on top. The aroma is of earthy mosaic hops. I’m tasting lots of earthy to slightly grassy hops and a touch of light malt. The mouth is very smooth and inviting.	4.23
1227	Focal Banger	"Poured into a Leo vs Ursus glass. A - really pretty translucent gold with a hunt of copper, near two finger very white fluffy head with some serious stick
S- Pineapple, sugar, some pine, lots of flowers, bright funk, dry yeast, slight booze and a nice mix of sweet hops and semi-sweet/ dry grains
T - Nice sweet, to funk than a very bright hop comes and stays. island flowers, pine, some nice booze, dry yeast, clean malt and a sweet to bitter finish
M- very nice complexity, really nice balance, medium plus acidity, medium to medium plus carbonation and a medium body
D - This beer is great, love the taste and stoked how different it is from Heady Topper. Really tasty, refreshing and you can sip or gulp. This is a very hoppy IPA with a nice malt back bone and pairs very well with veggie spring rolls.
F- Wish I had more of this, but as my grandfather used to say ""crap in one hand..."" 7% seems low for ABV, but trying to make this a hop bomb, I get it. If you like hops, you'll like this beer."	4.73
1228	Focal Banger	Very, very good. I've never rated Heady Topper because it's been a long time since I've had it. This is almost as good as any beer I've had, though. A little bite to it. There are some I still like better.	4.4
1229	Focal Banger	I do enjoy this beer, even though some may say I am anti-focal....sorry but to me its not Heady, that isn't saying I don't like it, but if both are on the shelf, I reach for the one and only....	4.42
1230	Focal Banger	"16oz can no date --- bought at the brewery on 9-20-19. Opened 10-9-19.
1"" white head, good retention at 1/4"". pale gold and hazy - not all the way opaque. Some floaties (poured into a glass for review). Good lacing apparent early.
Citrus - grapefruit, pine, weeds, and a little yeast barnyard on a couple of sniffs.
Zingy fruit, grapefruit, pine, berry, there's an earthy component that I can't find the words for that I tasted in Crusher as well...not sure if it's hops/malt/or yeast related, but it's unique. Mango flavor shines about half way through.
Medium body, medium carbonation...nice amount of bitterness - not aggressive/over the top but more than expected for a beer classified here as a NEIPA, this strikes a very nice balance between NE and WC. Mouthfeel isn't ""soft"" but maybe full is the word I would use, again not sure on the right descriptor for this.
Very good."	4.34
1231	Focal Banger	I tried a can of this beer at the Hilton hotel in downtown Burlington,VT. It poured a hazy yellow with white head that left some lace. The scent had tropical fruit notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tropical fruit peel presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.	4.41
1232	Focal Banger	Look: Light amber with a small white head and minimal lacing.. Smell: Honeyed grapefruit and leafy hops.. Taste: Aggressive grapefruit bitterness up front. Long, bitter finish. Some of that honeyed grapefruit comes through..  568 characters	3.04
1233	Focal Banger	Expected way more out of this one. I forgot to check the date on the can so maybe I just need to try it fresh. Still a nice highly drinkable IPA, just not up to the hype. Will try again when the situation arises.	4.08
1234	Focal Banger	"Pours a nice orange/golden color. 2 1/2 finger white head. Head retention is decent. Minimal lacing on the glass as the head dissipates.
The nose is a nice hop/ citrus aroma. I get some pineapple, mango, grapefruit.
Taste - It has a creamy citrus flavor up front, with the flavors as described by the aroma. It then turns into a nice pine hop on the backside.
The body is soft, and creamy. Full bodied. Some carbonation that gives it a pop in my throat.
This is one solid beer, and I'm happy to finally try it."	4.3
1235	Focal Banger	"16oz can.. A: When poured into a glass, the color is a hazy chalky golden that looks like a good heff. There's about a finger of dense and soft white foam that slowly faded into a fuzzy collar and oily film leaving a sticky network of lace. No sedimentation.
S: Huge dry hop nose with notes of grassy pine mixed with fresh cut ripe citrus.
T/M: Huge citrus up front followed by fresh cut grass and a touch of sweet citrus juice. The finish is full of bitter pine and a kiss of dough malt/yeast. Pine really lingers in the bitter aftertaste. Medium-full body, soft and fluffy mouthfeel with a nice chewy to it and smooth velvet/fluffy carbonation. Bitterness is grassy and citrusy but any sharp edges are rounded off. It still lingers long after the swallow with a assertive presence that lets you know you’re still drinking an ipa. Not sweet and no residual sugar. Finish is drying.
O: The hop profile and assertive bitterness and drying finish remind me of balanced west coast ipa but the mouthfeel is definitely softer and fluffier. I’d be ok with hazy ipas if, like this, they still tasted like a beer, and weren't under-attenuated sugary juice bombs. In a blind taste test this would rank up there with some of the best clear ipas."	4.53
1236	Focal Banger	"Can from brewery
No date
Hazy pale yellow, 2 finger bright white, billowy head that lingers
Smells tropical, pineapple, apricots, wheat, grass
Tastes as smells, sweet citrus rinds, very little malt back bone...ie just enough
Mouthfeel creamy, tingley, no cloy
One of my top 3 NE IPAs. Whole is greater than the parts"	4.67
1237	Focal Banger	One of my favorite DIPAs if not my favorite of the moment. It gets a knock down for look bc it’s just damn ugly. Usually there’s something floating in it, but not this time for me. I smell some bitterness, but of course it doesn’t approach a Westcoast IPA level of it. Still, it’s the perfect balance for me vs some terribly sweet juicy NEIPAs. Don’t ever miss this when you can get it. It slightly outpaces Heady for me.	4.69
1238	Focal Banger	Can from the brewery in Stowe, VT. Pours a golden orange with a nice touch of opacity, has a fluffy white head with excellent lacing, smell is deep overripe nectarine flesh with a nice spicy grass note and sweet zesty citrus, I also get this like wet mashed potatoes and green onions sort of vibe that I enjoy, taste is a flash of sweet malty goodness up front that is blasted away by a mountain of citrusy hops finished with a nice lingering bitter pith, another odd note I get from this beer at times is French fries dipped in a chocolate milkshake, likely from the sweetness being blasted by sharp hops being similar to the saltiness of a fry juxtaposed to the sweetness of the shake, it’s a weird one. This beer is medium bodied, sharp, and well carbonated. Quite scrummy and it was nice to take a look at it in a glass and get a good whiff, but the taste and mouth feel is far superior from the can. Yum.	4.27
1239	Focal Banger	Damn this beer is just about perfect....even when poured and stored from the stemmed glass. it seduces you with that golden hop glow and aroma of the hop yeild gods of yore. You'll want to drink this with closefriends who can fully appreciate the zenith mood you'll find yourself slipping into.	4.91
1240	Focal Banger	Poured from can to tulip, hazy yellow, white head, moderate lacing. Nose is fruity, bready, mango, funk. Taste is more piney, grassy, and bitter, some mild fruit and mineral notes. Medium body and carbonation.	4.43
1241	Focal Banger	Years ago I hated Citra and Mosaic hop combos i remember thinking, why? This beer is so fucking good, had my first 4 for $21 (great Levittown PA bar, thanks to the owner for holding it for me, I got the last 4). You know it's that good when you have to get 3 more elsewhere at $8 a pop, which is a little (alot) ridiculous but look at it this way, its still less than most bar tabs.. Hugely bitter yet fruity, very juicy, and balanced. Bitter juicy fruit. Yea. Goes down way too easy I could drink this all day, take a nap, wake up and drink some more while making dinner. Oh, that's what I did today. Great beer, great day. My wallet will be hurting tomorrow, nah, not really. I didn't bore myself recently one Sat for 10 hours OT for nothing ... out.	4.82
1242	Focal Banger	Hop profile is definitely more earthy / grassy, has some vague pepper / vegetal notes as well, beyond that there is some citrus hops but just not in my wheelhouse, too much mosaic for me	3.93
1243	Focal Banger	A cut above. Drinking straight from the can as God intended. Really nice dank citrus nose, so unbelievably smooth and balanced, perfect dance between dank piney hops and lemon/orange zest, pear, apple cider, apple cider vinegar, so crushable at 7%. An elite IPA.	4.64
1244	Focal Banger	Cloudy, gold, with two fingers of thick white foam atop. Beautiful look.. Aroma springs from the can and leaps from the glass to fill the area. Sweet grapefruit, grapefruit pith, mango, orange pith, crisp grain, and some very tasty yeast notes make for a full strength, alluring bouquet.. Full flavored version of all the flavors in aroma, brightly and cleanly explodes in mouth, with pithy bitter winning out over grainy sweet to end the sip. Perfectly balanced blast..  709 characters	4.49
1245	Focal Banger	A very solid, fine-tasting NE-style IPA but just couldn't hold its own against the more-lauded Heady Topper. I would have loved to know how fresh this beer was since it was so hard to get - but I just couldn't find the canning date anywhere. Pours a very nice, slightly hazy yellow color with abundant fluffy white head and sheets of lingering lacing. Looks very, very nice. Smells of lots of fresh tropical fruity hops - grapefruit, mango, lemon, pineapple, tangerine - as well as some weaker floral hops, malt, vanilla and bread. Some weaker dank notes at the end. Taste follows the nose, but there was a decent hit of hoppy bitterness towards the middle and finish that wasn't unpleasant, just a little more sharp than I was accustomed to. I also expected more juiciness and I just didn't get it - maybe that left more harshness of the hops. Good, solid, mellow, mild mouthfeel and good carbonation. Not really sticky. I was just expecting a softer mouthfeel, akin to Heady Topper, Tree House Green and some other world-class NE-style IPAs. A great effort, but I'll keep looking for Heady.	4.23
1246	Focal Banger	Translucent golden straw color with a slight haze. Fluffy, no e white head that eventually disappears, leaving lacing along the glass as I drink. Some visible carbonation steaming up from the bottom.. There is a bready malt sweetness saying cotton candy to me. An green, herbal note remiscient of oregano and bay leaf.. Tons of citrus on the flavor. Orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit. Again, sweet bready malt profile and a dry, bitter pithy flavor.	4.27
1247	Focal Banger	Strong piney aroma precedes a very hoppy flavor. Although the Alchemist insists one drink this fine brew from the can, I did pour a bit into a glass, and the color was a very pale gold color. It ain’t no Heady, but it’s pretty darn good!	4.05
1248	Focal Banger	From the monster can, it pours a hazy amber with a nice thick white head that slowly dissipates and leaves lacing. In the nose, it is spicy hoppy. In the mouth, it is oddly spicy hoppy.	4.05
1249	Focal Banger	"Maybe it's denial or maybe it's just out of stubborn contempt, but I've always been a proponent of remaining loyal to flagship beers over the popular trend of picking the second most popular beer and claiming that it tastes better (e.g. Blind Pig over Pliny; Another One over Lunch, etc.)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
People, including some of my most trusted beer sources, have come out in droves and emphatically informed me that Focal Banger is indeed the superior Alchemist offering. Whereas I've been in complete and reluctant denial even to the point of boycotting trying it altogether, now that I've had a chance to properly sit down and taste it (without having to share, I might add!) I think I'm starting to get what the hub-bub is all about.. The best way I can describe Focal Banger is to say that it's like The Alchemist's attempt at consolidating Heady Topper with the #hazebro craze; while it embraces a similar philosophy in providing consistent wave after wave of hops flavor balanced by a robust and supple malt backbone, it abandons the old-timey approach of vigorous hopping through multiple varietals in favor of a simple Citra and Mosaic combination, and perhaps as a retroactive nod to their distant neighbors in Massachusetts, the rather complex grain bill that gives Heady its robust yet soothing biscuit-y flavor is replaced with a drier cracker-like pale malt base.. The resulting combination/substitution is one worthy of going head to head with any beer that's currently being churned out of Canton or Charlton, MA. An intricate mixture of dragonfruit, citron, floral hops, and light resin forms the aromatic basis of the brew. The tropical fruit aspect on the nose takes as recessive role, giving way to an intensified serving of citrus, resin, and floral hops with the passage of time; there's a slight hint of honey and crackers toward the back end which starts showing if you're really patient with the beer..  2,820 characters"	4.52
1250	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	L - not sure how this one has eluded me for so long. Pours a thick murk. I'd say yellow, but it's a dark shade of yellow, almost brown. Oily head with a rainbow sheen.. S - fruity peach, pineapple, and apricot. Herbal mango and hop esters. Tart lemon balances an incredible aroma.. T - soft candied orange and tangerine. Subtly spicy with dank hop oils and vibrant passionfruit. Citrus rind a la grapefruit, orange, and lemon-lime, but almost no bitterness, just a mild tingle. Still manages to avoid total sweetness with a touch of dryness and overall herbal undertones. Gentle and balanced..  1,028 characters	4.74
1251	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"Mother of god this one was tasty. At first I thought I had a ""regular"" Trillium Congress Street, then realized I'd somehow scored the DDH version (found it online). Canned date 8/9/19 so I made sure to try this one fresh. And it knocked my socks off! Loved the look - reminded me of some of the best Tree House offerings. Very hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and thick sheets and rings of lingering lacing that clung to the glass and did not fade away. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, passionfruit and guava; also malt, caramel, creamy vanilla and some weaker floral hops. Some dankness in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the slightly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Extremely juicy. At first I was going to give the smell/taste ratings of 4/4.25 since they were surprisingly muted and I was disappointed. But then as the beer warmed a little the second glass was incredible, more pungent and flavorful and complex with more depth. This is what I was looking for! Mouthfeel was incredible, soft, pillowy, luscious, sticky, smooth, coated the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. Just an outstanding beer and I am lucky to have acquired other Trillium beers to try."	4.53
1252	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Pours a hazy murky pale orange or orange with some yellow thrown in to tone it down some. Two finger off white head falls slow and laces well.. Aroma is light tropical fruits with more citrus bite then the others from Trillium at least it seems so at this time. Besides the citrus and tropical fruits some pine resin mingled in there some where. This one actually smells like it might have some bitterness to it.. Taste is pretty much starts fruity NEIPA style typical pineapple, mango, passion fruits but moves to more regular citrus grapefruit rind bitterness. Finish is what makes this one a little different god the grapefruit rind along with some pine like resin mingled in to add to the bitterness, like the best of both worlds..  1,038 characters	4.46
1253	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Just a classic top end New England IPA. Hazy grapefruit color, juicy as hell with both citrus and a variety of fruit flavors. So juicy, I was thinking there was fruit pulp in the glass.	4.5
1254	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"On tap at the brewery.. Smell and taste are great and hoppy, resinous, tropical and citrus rind.
Full body with hop oils and notable prickly bitterness.. Overall excellent! Glad I could try it so fresh."	4.4
1255	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	16oz can. Poured out a hazy, golden orange color with a small, white head of foam. It smelled of pineapple, orange and grapefruit. So much tropical sweetness with a piney bitterness and toasted caramel.	4.49
1256	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"This is very close to a perfect NE IPA.
Color is bright orange. 1 finger white head.
Smell is juicy fruit and passion fruit. Smells great.
Taste is orange juice and grapefruit and some tropical fruits. Finishes dry which is rare for a NEIpa. But that’s what makes this so good, it’s not too sweet. Leaves you coming back for more sips."	4.69
1257	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"1 pint can
Served in an oversized, stemless, wine glass. This beer pours an orangish yellow and hazy AF. It is topped with an inch of beige head that leaves nice lacing.. The aroma is tropical and stone fruit. I get a slight medicinal presence..  462 characters"	4.18
1258	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Canned 12/19/16; drank 12/23/16 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a big white head; frothy lace..  378 characters	3.63
1259	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"Can from Fort Point.
Murky orange yellow with nice head and lacing, smells like fresh sliced peach, pinapple ice cream, candied tangerine skins, tastes like sweet peach flesh with a citrus zest finish, creamy body with a lingering prickliness. A peachy citrus delight."	4.25
1260	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"A: Hazy gold/orange with rich white head and great lacing.
N: Loads of citrus, hops, floral, and malt.
T: Lots of pineapple with some mango, great hops notes, minor malt and soft sweetness.
M: Smooth and easy to drink, zero bite and flavors are really nice.
O: Loved this beer, was one of my favorite from them."	4.59
1261	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Very hazy pale color with off-white head. Aroma is dank, herbal, really green and hoppy. Taste follows, really hoppy and herbal, quite harsh, not very bitter but there is a hop burn. Medium body and carbonation. Really nice hop profile but at 2 weeks it's quite harsh on the palate.	4.5
1262	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	08/2014 - Grapefruit, floral bouquet, hops up front; fruity, well hopped body with lingering peach, and a bit of pepper on the back of the palate; balanced, yet a wee bit of bitterness on the finish.	4.6
1263	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"Smell, look, and feel are exactly what you expect from opaque NE-style IPAs. The taste is a different story. The two strongest notes are teriyaki-flavored beef jerky and yogurt-covered raisins. I'm not kidding - it's uncanny how similar this tastes to those two things. Sure, this has the vague tropical fruit note (mango maybe? It's just a note that screams ""tropical"" in my mind but it's not any single identifiable fruit) and the peppery hop spiciness. But yeah, teriyaki beef jerky and yogurt raisins. That's not necessarily a bad thing but I kinda wish I'd known this beer would taste like a trip to Ocean State Job Lot."	3.58
1264	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"They had me at ""double dry hopped"". Leaping out with copious additions of Galaxy hops, Trillium Brewing's Congress Street sees a breath of fresh air that's nothing like our other congress.. Leading with those high aromas of Galaxy hops, a tropical array of tangy, bright and herbal character seems tea-like, juniper and passionfruit to the nose. But to the eye, the visual weight of butter pecan ice cream comes with an orange tinge in a complete opaque matte finish. And then the taste of Double Dry Hopped Congress Street spills onto the tongue with a pastry-rich angelfood cake softness rounded with light caramel and honey.. Any malt attention is short lived because the hops once again explode on the tongue, bringing all the radiant glory of Galaxy's passionfruit, kiwi, lime, lemon, guava and papaya flavors with a juicy, punch-like backbone. Sweetness continues to recede as the tropical and citrus flavors develop a spicy bitterness of verbena, sassafras, citrus peel and a piquant resinous bitterness. Bright grassy, leafy and stemmy flavors bring a late palate of green tea, sprucy gin and gently muddled pine needles..  1,490 characters"	4.52
1265	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	"Unreadable date on bottom of can...
Moderate pour yields an almost one inch, slightly off-white head over a very cloudy, almost murky, body with some sticky lacing. Nose of tropical fruit (mango, pineapple), dankness (pine, slight onion), and sweet citrus (orange, tangerine, grapefruit.) Taste mirrors nose pretty well with an orange pith flavor taking over the middle and finishing nicely bitter and dry. Very nice feel and overall, a fine IPA from Trillium, probably my favorite from them. Cheers!"	4.46
1266	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/11/2017. Pours opaquely hazy golden/orange/green color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild pine, herbal, grassy, zesty bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an outstanding NEIPA! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the very mildly bitter/drying finish. Outstanding soft feel for the style. Very juicy and lightly dank Galaxy hop complexity; balanced pale/wheat malt backbone, not overly sweet/heavy for the style. Held up extremely well considering the can dating. I'm sure fresh would be mind blowing, as I had regular Congress Street a while ago. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.	4.15
1267	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Canned on 05/04/18, 09:38:05.. Pours a murky pale gold. A really nice color, with a fairly small head of frothy head that settles quickly and leaves sporadic lace.. Ahh, the joy that is the nose of a Trillium Hazy. Overripe tropical mango and pineapple, booze, and a subtle malt bill that combine for a truly beautiful aroma..  735 characters	4.6
1268	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Superb milky orange body, essentially opaque, with a pungent nose of grapefruit and peaches, with mild mint and pine beneath. Lovely fruit juice flavor, mildly bitter close suggesting grapefruit pith. The feel is light for the power. Delicious milky glory. Well worth seeking.	4.71
1269	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	16oz. can into Night Shift stemware.. Looks like an orange milkshake. Nose is citrus, pineapple and grapefruit. A slight touch of astringency actually amplifies the fruit profile. Beer opens pineapple, clementine and melon. Super juicy and sweet. Orange flavors front and center in the middle with a dry, almost grapefruit-like feel towards the finish. Really good. Body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down bone-dry. Almost sticky finish. Probably one of the driest IPAs I've had to date.. This may be Trillium's best IPA though from what I've had, the can isn't what I remember the bottle to be. Still, a must try for sure.	4.27
1270	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	I believe this was one of the brews we tasted in while staying in a Red Roof Inn one evening and it held up well against other Trillium Brews. Not among the best IPAs I've tasted but good none-the-less and I would certainly drink this one again.	3.97
1271	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	This is the definition of a true NEIPA! A strong citrus character up front of orange, grapefruit and pineapple. Awesome hops follow on the backend that linger, reminding you that this is DDH beer. I always enjoy the aroma of good galaxy hops!. I really can't think of anything that I would change for this beer. Put it on your bucket list for IPAs because it delivers in spades.	4.93
1272	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	On tap at brewery. L: Hazy yellow orange. Small head, some lacing, retains ring.. S: Insane juicebomb of ripe tropical fruit like pineapple, with some tangerine..  454 characters	4.55
1273	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	It's difficult to put my finger on my favorite Trillium IPA. This one is a tremendously good beer, and certainly a contender - but I'm expecting DDH Fort Point to blow it away.. I think what I want more of in DDH Congress Street is a bit of a bitter hop profile - it may just be too juicy and clean. It needs some contrasting presence to make that appreciable.. Nevertheless - it's a fantastic beer.	4.5
1274	Double Dry Hopped Congress Street	Surprised I hadn’t reviewed this yet. I find DDH offerings from trillium fantastic, but I can only drink one before my palette is blown - ddh Congress street is no exception.. I love the rindy citrus bitterness that cuts through some of the tropical fruit and malt. Not a low bitter beer as everyone makes most trillium beers out as. Good one - glad I have three more in the fridge for the weekend.	4.34
1275	Very GGGreennn	A- Tallboy pours into a snifter with a chalky and floury yellow orange body. A thick and truly creamy white cap rises out of the beer to an inch high with amazing retention. Tons of lacing in thick blankets around the glass.. S- Can smell fresh hops all the way across the room moments after pouring this one with tons of fruit, dank herbs and floral notes as well. The hop bouquet has strong melon, mango, papaya, dank weed and peach with hints of tangerine, citrus zest, floral hops, pungent mint, creamsicle and slight onion. This one is basically all hops with some sweet suggestion.. T- Definitely one of the better Tree House brews I have had in the last few months. This one rides the balance between sweet, juicy hops and bitterness wonderfully with everything starting out with those juicy melons, papayas, bubble gum and peach. Beyond that are hints of tangerine, creamsicle, berries, zesty orange, grapefruit, mint and dank weed. Just another level of juicy on this one. Fairly sweet but it suits the nectar hops..  1,474 characters	4.69
1276	Very GGGreennn	"Canned 06/07/19, 10:48:01.
“CORBIN! CORBIN! MY MAN I HAVE NO FIRE!”. Opaque golden pour, great hue with soft, creamy head that rises about a half an inch above the body of the beer. As it settles, even layers of lace cling desperately to the inside of the glass.. The nose isn’t overpowering, hitting first with aromas of candied grapefruit, pineapple, and melon. Not overly complex, just a clean, citrusy, and straightforward. A more noticeable booziness as the beer opens up a little..  1,092 characters"	4.58
1277	Very GGGreennn	Maybe it's because Treehouse is so readily available to me but I was a bit let down by this one. I went to the brewery because Juice Machine was on tap but it kicked only a few hours into the day so they tapped Very Gggreen. I had read good things about Very Green and I understand Very Gggreen is a rarity to find, so I snagged a draft for $8.. This one has bitterness to it ... grapefruit peel, resin and lemon. It's oddly smooth for a beer pike this with a very, very big mouthful. It almost feels like soapy water in the mouth and has a cloudy appearance and an orange color with a thin white head. Easy to tell its Treehouse by looking at it.. It was a draft poured into a clear plastic cup (really Treehouse???) so by the time it reached me, it had no real scent to speak of. If you poured Very Green or even Green, I probably couldn't tell the difference between the three of them. This is a beer geek's beer who might be able to pick out incredibly subtle notes..  1,742 characters	4.2
1278	Very GGGreennn	From can into pint glass, less than 1 month from canning date.. This is very much on par with King Jjjulius. Deep opaque orange appearance with good bit of foam present upon aggressive pour. It's like most very well done NE IPAs in Tree House style: ripe tropical fruity aroma and it s followed into the taste. Fruity, sweet. Creamy full mouthfeel yet very easy to drink. Well carbonated. The major difference between this and many of the other well done NE IPAs is that it's amped up. BIGGER aroma, BIGGER flavor, BIGGER mouthfeel, etc. It's perfect beer for what it strives to be and belongs in the conversations along King JJJulius and Very Hazy as the best of what Tree House has to offer for the style.	4.99
1279	Very GGGreennn	Near perfect NEIPA. Drinks like it's 4% without any of the bitterness green has. Amplifies everything you like about very green and dials it up a couple notches. mouthfeel is softer than even Very Green. Soft citrus and ripe pineapple combine to make this beer amazing. The mouthfeel, taste, smell, all of it A+. Possibly my favorite IPA	5
1280	Very GGGreennn	"L: Light honeycomb and apricot hues with a rich foamy head and gratuitous lacing that clings throughout the session
S: Bursting with pineapple, cantaloupe, and candied oranges
T: Bright melons, tangerines, peaches, pineapple gummy bears, and a mild vanilla
F: Infinitely smooth - this is a top tier soft and pillowy mouthfeel - on par with King Julius and King JJJ
O: Truly the pinnacle of the Green series. I enjoyed this side-by-side with Very Green and Very GGGreennn made a bold declaration. The mouthfeel alone is iconic. Just effortlessly juicy and soft with wave after wave of delicious and yet balanced tropical fruits. As ostentatious as this beer is in its excellence, it is deftly restrained. If this beer doesn't represent a near perfect IPA, I just can't help you."	4.99
1281	Very GGGreennn	Opaque maize with a tall white head leaving full on spray paint walls of lacing.. The frothy, fluffy full body delivers notes of bubblegum and Orange Julius to the max, with a dry finish. Mango and peaches and cream develop further, while there's a lightly dank and cannabic background accent. It's overall smoother than the Very Green we had next to it.. As unimpressed as I was with Very Green side by side Green, Very Gggreennn was a unanimous winner over Very Green as well.	4.2
1282	Very GGGreennn	Perfect hazy yellow color. Beautiful sweet and bright to nose, thick and smooth body. Sharp and crisp taste with a still present hop bite. Perfect for anyone who likes this hop profile. Also, love the 5th element quote on the can “Corbin Corbin, My man I have no fire.”	4.61
1283	Very GGGreennn	"Big thanks to rudzud for hooking me up, canned 6/07/19
Pours a big foamy bubbly semi dense large head that retains forever, good soapy lacing as well, cloudy opaque murky tan-gold color. Nose is everything I could have ever wanted in the style, loads of super juicy tropical fruits, tons of pineapple mostly, but also a strong passion fruit and mango/papaya note, a bit of a doughy base malt and creamy, little citrus and peach. Taste hits right in stride, super juicy with loads of tropical fruits, pineapple passion fruit smoothie like, some citrus and a little pith, orange mango sherbet, papaya and mango juice, a little cantaloupe, with a little doughy creamy base malt, a touch of chalky minerals with the pith, low bitterness and almost no alcohol, plenty of creamy doughy malt to prop up the hops, drying on the finish with tons more tropical fruits and some citrus, a little green like spicy hop as well that likely dropped a bit since it was super fresh and this would probably be even better after another week, light bitterness lingering.  1,911 characters"	4.84
1284	Very GGGreennn	About as perfect of an IPA as you can get.. It looks like OJ in the glass with a slight peachy hue to it, and I definitely get the hit of tropical and citrus on the nose along with a creamsicle weaving into the nose.. The taste has a bit more astringent of a hop flavor than I'd prefer, but other than that, this beer is 100% lights out. Just waves of different melon and pine flavors without one dominating the other, just dancing to vie for your attention..  559 characters	4.77
1285	Very GGGreennn	Picked-up four cans at the Tree House brewery in Charlton for about five dollars. Canned-on date of 6/7/19. My forty eighth beer from these guys. Had 2 the night of game 7, but was not rational enough to review, given the result. Extremely good, a little bit of hop burn, just behind Very Green for my favorite TH beer (have had JM & Jjj, not KJ or KJjj). 2 Cases of Baby Bright for 1 KJjj?	4.75
1286	Very GGGreennn	"Vggg
Look: 4.75 golden yellow, creamy thick head
Smell: 4.75 mango, peach, tropical
Taste: 5 peach, mango, tropical fruit cornucopia, slight lemon grass danky hops at the finish
Feel: 5 full body, semi dry finish that makes the mouth want more.
Overall 5 best dipa yet"	4.93
1287	Very GGGreennn	Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass.. Pours an entirely opaque orange cream color with a finger of frothy white head. The retention is stupid, the head just sits there like an asshole refusing to leave. After about 45 minutes, the head finally dissolves into a thin sheet, leaving a wonderful crown of lacing along the way. This beer looks like an orange sorbet milkshake and it's ridiculous.. The aroma is equally stupid. Big notes of pineapple, candied orange, lemon meringue, and grapefruit. There's also plenty of orange creamsicle and peach rings before a wave of honeydew melon. Subtly herbaceous and dank on the back end. A lot like Green, if Green took a shot of HGH in the butt..  1,617 characters	4.96
1288	Very GGGreennn	A - A bright milky orange body that is completely solid, white head with just a tinge of orange, and curtains of lacing. It looks the epitome of a NE IPA.. S - The smell is pungent fruit, mango and orange juice, orange cream soda, and a vanilla-banana note in the finish.. T - Joining the orange and mango notes from the nose are pineapple and peach come through in the taste. The close introduces a hint of grapefruit juice and mild pith elements that balances the slightly sweet open..  694 characters	5
1289	Very GGGreennn	Picked up a 4 pack of this at the brewery on release.. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice super hazy golden hue hue with a dense, creamy two finger white that fades to leave very sticky lacing and a rather thick blanket. Each sip reveals a layer of lacing.. S - Aromas of bright tropical pineapple creamsicle notes as well as slightly bitter citrus peel and juice. Little doughy, earthy, melon forward, quite juicy with flashes of almost strawberry like sweetness..  2,694 characters	4.84
1290	Very GGGreennn	TREE HOUSE VERY GGGREENNN DIPA 6/9/19. Acquired today at the brewery. Canned 6/7/19. Quote from the movie The Fifth Element on the bottom.. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House temmed tulip..  832 characters	4.77
1291	Very GGGreennn	Pours super hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is big honeydew melon, bubblegum, orange creamsicle and pineapple. Heavy bodied, sweet, with moderate carbonation. Wow is there a burn at the back end of this beer. Super hop saturation. Very thick. A total sipper of an ipa. Gggreennn blew me away. This one is great, but is not as mind blowing an experience as that beer. Still exceptional.	4.54
1292	Very GGGreennn	L - been waiting for this one... Green, arguably Tree House's best beer, and the stutters and Very's that follow seem hard to top. This should be the top, right? Pours a hazed-up Green. Starts dark on the top and lightens up down toward the bottom. Hard to tell if that's the reflection of the can, but I'm getting a radioactive swamp monster vibe. Milky gradient of yellow to deep orange with some serious head fluff. Lacing clings to the glass, but the oily foam remains, jiggling like jell-o.. S - massive, earthy, penetrating aroma. Starts with that classic pineapple creamsicle and evolves into a doughy, melony, juicy-fruity hop bomb. Ripe and sticky, yet clean and sugar-free. Kiwi and strawberries play a supporting role. This is Green in every essence of its being. Strong Monson nostalgia vibes.. T - zoinks. This hits me as if Green were a liquor. It's not boozey, but it has the potent warmth and zip of something that lights up your insides. Don't misunderstand, this is not acidic or overly bitter, this is pure Green concentrate. Initial sensation is a quick bite, then melts into the softest pineapple orange vanilla sherbet creamsicle. Smoothies on top of smoothies, with quite a range of flavors from kiwi to strawberry to banana. Tropical and pithy. Stringy pineapple. Danimals yogurt smoothies. Wheaty Galaxy crackers. Notes from GGG in the form of sweetness (sans sugariness) and fruity berries, but also Very vibes with its mealy, yeasty tanginess. Coats the mouth with hop residue and as the flavor continues to wash over me gullet long after my sip, bitterness sets in. Subtle at first, it tingles louder and louder into a Green electric current that sits on the tongue, eating away at it. Finishes vaguely doughy in Green fashion, finally ending with that burnt-out feeling you get from housing freeze pops until your face hurts. This is a fruit bomb and palate destroyer in one..  2,585 characters	4.88
1293	Very GGGreennn	Forget everything you know about IPAs. Forgot everything you thought you knew about New England IPAs. This takes everything to an entirely new level. Absolutely mind blowing. The look is just crazy, too.	5
1294	Very GGGreennn	Batch Canned 6/07/19 and reviewing based on 2 cans consumed within 2 days of canning. L: About as lively of a color as you could want. Looks like opaque pineapple juice with a fluffy meringue head.. S: As soon as you crack the can you can smell that this thing is an unrestrained hop monster. Very bright notes of pineapple, orange pulp, and an unabashed hop-saturated dankness to provide a kick to back up the citrus fruit..  1,206 characters	4.98
1295	Very GGGreennn	I saw this posted and ran out to the brewery as soon as I could (damn conference calls). Everything you love about 'Green' cranked up. Super hazy. Super creamy. Super citrusy. Just awesome.	4.79
1296	Very GGGreennn	Pours a completely opaque vibrant gold. The nose is full on pineapple and honeydew with a bubblegum garnish. The taste follows, but the honeydew is punched up to the 10th degree. Tastes like creamy fruit juice with a slightly drying and grassy back end. Taste sticks around to the next swallow. Where has this beer been all my life? LARRRRRRRRGE!!!	4.78
1297	Green	"A friend visiting MA returned with one. 16 ounce can. age 49 days.
Beautiful in a glass, very cloudy and nice thick head.
Taste: very hoppy and the further I go with this the more I realize this is just a high quality beer with nothing added. I wish I had more than one to give a proper review. Very simple and yet complex. It is exactly what I expect an IPA to be.
Sadly not available in Pennsylvania. Anybody have a van with some free time to drive to MA?
Seek this one out if you can find it!"	4.65
1298	Green	"Picked up 2 cases of beer 2 weeks ago from Treehouse. 2 of those cans were this. I've drank one of them. This review is based on that beer.. Doesn't pour the ugly like a lot of the NE hazies do. Legit more attractive than that. 1/2"" white head on top of a brighter kind of chicken gravy appearance. Beyond the usual ""green"" aspect of hop saturation, this one had quite the blend of stuff going on, seemed like some Galaxy. Truly a blend of both worlds, there was a fresh/wet hop like feel to it, could just be my mind playin' tricks on me bc of the name Green, but I dunno, seemed like a blend of Galaxy and freshly harvested Chinook. Good mix of pine and pineapple to it.. I found the mouthfeel to be a conundrum, had a green burn to it, moderate bitterness, but also had a dry west coast like mouth feel to it as opposed to being a flat trub bed of oats and wheat (which all Treehouse beers seem to have, usually dump the last 1-2oz of a can..  1,093 characters"	4.15
1299	Green	Guys. Wow. Wow... I love this beer because of one reason: simplicity. And I feel the same way about Pliny. It may not be the most flavorful. It may not be like going home with Rihanna after the Grammys, but damn it’s just so smooth! And that’s what we have here. This beer is just so damn soft! Soft, smooth melons, well, like Rihanna! And that’s it! It’s not complex like Trump’s tax returns! It’s simply like ordering a moons over my hammys at Denny’s.. Yep!	4.28
1300	Green	"A: Murky yellow/gold with thick foam and massive lacing.
N: Grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, pine, and some malt sweetness.
T: Sweet then bitter hit, notes of grapefruit, resin, piney flavors, minor malt, and some floral.
M: Chewy and bitter rounded with some sweetness, slight dryness on finish.
O: I enjoyed the beer but a different feel on this one, more towards the West Coast for me and less sweetness I am used to from Tree House."	4.42
1301	Green	Drank along with Julius for comparison. This was more golden with slight haze, adequate head with good lacing and retention. Sharp on the nose with more earthy notes and hints of herb and pine. I really like galaxy hops and was excited about this, but I didn’t care for it. I thought there was very little citrus or funk here. It was dry, herby, and mineral with significant bitterness. On the other hand, it got better as I drank and I appreciated the full bodied complexity. Can’t say I would seek it again though. If you are expecting a NEIPA, you might be thrown off.	3.88
1302	Green	Poured from a 16 oz can into a Zywiec tulip. L: Hazed golden pour with thick fluffy white head. Great lacing.. S: Tropical fruit and citrus. Juice and happiness..  557 characters	4.65
1303	Green	From a can dated 7/18/19. Another superb TH IPA. This Galaxy hopped offering has an excellent blend of tropical notes along with a piney, somewhat bittery note that distinguishes it from other IPAs. Highly drinkable, and not a hint of booziness. Deserving of elite status.	4.6
1304	Green	"Canned 7/26/19. ""FERDA"". Translucent golden beige hay, no floaters or can debris
Vigorous pour yields two fingers white head with various bubble sizes, full curtain lacing and cap
Pineapple, tangelo, grapefruit, TH yeast scents
Bitter pineapple, tangerine, melon, slight pine and pale malt flavors.
Smooth, sticky mouthfeel, stubborn carbonation, nice hop bitterness at the back of the tongue.
Bracing hop bitterness balances out the fruit, no alcohol heat. Great summer DIPA"	4.7
1305	Green	my intro to tree house beers. This beer is as good a usage of galaxy as any. The problem I see with a lot of other breweries galaxy heavy beers is they don't retain as much of the bitterness that I would like to have. Green has a good of tropical notes and bitterness. This is a beer I could have time and time again.	4.52
1306	Green	A pale orange body, slight translucence on the side, off white head, moderate bubbled lacing. Nose is orange juice, the taste introduces a pungent grassy hop line. Mild bitterness in the finish. Deliciously drinkable.	4.58
1307	Green	Just. Amazing. All the hype is true. I tried so hard not to let my preconceived notions of this beer sway me - I'd heard all the hype, read some reviews (although I tried to stay away from many of them), know all about the mystique surrounding Tree House Brewing Company. Managed to find a trio of Tree House IPAs online and couldn't save them for a special occasion as I wanted to sample them as fresh as possible. This one was the oldest - canned on 3/27/19 - so it was first up to bat. And oh man was this an amazing NE-style IPA. Clearly the best I've ever had. Looked absolutely outstanding - hazy pale yellow color, layers and layers of pillowy-soft fluffy white head and abundant sheets of lingering lacing that lasted forever. I gave it a 4.75 rating for look, just out of principle of not giving 5s, but I'm not sure how much better a beer could have looked. Smells incredible, loads of fresh citrus juicy fruit - pineapple, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, a little lemon - with some more faint floral hops and malt in the distant background. Taste follows the nose, and that sweeter malt backbone was very restrained and tame. That was good since there wasn't as much of a bitter hoppy hit as I was expecting at the finish. The mouthfeel was out of this world - soft, inviting, pillowy, luscious, slightly sticky. Smooth, creamy and juicy and perfect carbonation balance. Honestly I can't believe this beer had a higher ABV as it was like drinking some sort of luscious juicy summer concoction. Well done, Tree House. Well done.	4.69
1308	Green	Wonderful NE style IPA pours a beautiful hazy gold color. The aroma on this thing jumped out of the glass, so much citrus and tropical flavors, mango, pineapple, a little less bitterness than Julius, but enough that it’s balanced. Mouthfeel is like a freakin pillow and the finish is crisp and juicy. This exceeded expectations.	4.8
1309	Green	Textbook New England IPA. Combining American and Australian hops. Hazy gold, beautifully complex as the USA-Aussie hops engage in a full rugby scrum in your mouth. Fabulous beer!	4.5
1310	Green	Was giving a 16oz. Can from a customer of mine from Connecticut who knows I’m an IPA junkie. This brew is the bomb. Unfortunately, from what I understand I won’t be able to find this anytime soon at my local outlets in Pennsylvania.	4.9
1311	Green	I like everything about this except for the smell. It smells exactly like a frat house the day after a party with all that beer in the carpet. Exactly.	3.68
1312	Green	"Look - hazy, dark orange, not a lot of head or lacing
Smell- hoppy with a whiff of citrus
Taste - sharp bitterness that hits the tongue as you swallow
Feel - very smooth texture
The sharp hoppiness is just not my preference"	4.05
1313	Green	Pours yellow orange with a thinnish white head (might have been poor pour technique on my part, though). A light, almost effervescent taste that I really love. Insanely easy-drinking for a 7.5 ABV. While I wouldn’t quite rate it with my TH faves Julius and Haze, this is another monster beer from the folks in central MA.	4.68
1314	Green	Served in my Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a tight, fluffy, one inch, off-white head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a consistent, 1/8th inch cap with delicate textured strands of lacing revealed as it disperses. Great nose - citrus pith, rind and a hint of tropical fruit (perhaps guava). Taste follows nose, with the addition of a kiss of breadiness at the finish that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a touch of acidity. Not much to say about this one. Quite tasty and characteristic of the style. Happy to have had the chance to try it.	4.04
1315	Green	Had this on 2019-01-22 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2019-01-01 (they were working on New Year's Day?). A - Murky straw-orange with a 1-finger head that drops quickly leaving excellent lace.. S - Pineapple, tangerine, orange juice and plenty of hop bud aroma but not overly-dank, which I appreciate. Can't detect much malt. Very pleasant although not overpowering aroma..  995 characters	4.49
1316	Green	"Canned on 1/1. Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 1/4.
A:Peach colour and deep opaque colour. Looks perfect ! . 2 finger of clouds. remail nice white lacing.
S:PEach, mango, tropical fruites aromas.
T:Slightly stronger bitterness than Julius. But still, mild and soft and creamy balanced taste.
M:Creamy, smooth mild carbo.
O:Very Juicy like peach nectar. But sweetness is well controlled, means not too sweet.
Great NE IPA. ABV is almost IIPA."	4.61
1317	Green	Easily my top 3 from TreeHouse. This thing is packed to the brim with Galaxy which is just such a delicious hop. Massive crisp juicy notes on everything here, mouth feel is god like, is anyone surprised, TH is world class.	5
1318	Green	Citrus on the nose. Taste the orange and pineapple. Very hazy can’t see through my spiegelau ipa glass. Wonderful mouth feel. Nice bitterness at the end.	4.75
1319	Green	"L: similar color to lime juice, orange juice, or mango juice. Small head that quickly dissipates
S: orange, pepper, pineapple, and malt sweetness. Reminds me of toasted, buttered English Muffins for breakfast with orange juice
T: Decently bitter, not overpowering. Definitely can taste the malt. Hint of citrus, rather than a grapefruit bomb. Mild spice. Twang of cherry at the end
F: good carbonation and mouthwatering finish. This has to be the most balanced IPAs I have had thus far. Most IPAs only taste of grapefruit and juniper berries. This one is nuanced, mouthwatering, and refined."	4.5
1320	Green	A galaxy hop focused beer! My favorite beer from Tree House. Worth the drive and the wait in line. Beautifully crafted time and time again. My hats off to Tree House for creating this and keeping it coming. Only thing that tops it in my opinion is Very Green! Cheers!!!!	4.48
1321	Green	A world of thanks to Brian for this one. Pint can dated 9/19/18 - poured into a tulip at 44f.. Pours a glass of pulpy fresh squeeze orange juice that has been whipped up in a blender. Opaque, shiny, glowing orange, with a finger of foamy head that reduces to a sudsy film and a collar. Looks like juice.. Nose is very ripe mango, ripe pineapple, naval oranges, hint of Meyer lemon, hint of guava, some grapefruit pith. There are some floral notes going on, but the one that's sticking out to me is some well hidden rosemary sprig. A big dose of late-hopped earthy dankness. Greeeen..  1,901 characters	4.57
1322	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Today our fence is being repaired after a Tornado ripped through the neighborhood almost three weeks ago, so I am celebrating by drinking Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise (2015). It was among the best Lambics that I've ever had.. Look: dark red with an inch thick off-white head. Aroma: raspberry, white wine..  487 characters	4.68
1323	Lou Pepe - Framboise	750ml bottle at share. Ruby colored pour, head is a light pink. Raspberrries. Period. Huge berry aroma and taste, normal lambic funk. Slight barrel eleemnts. Great stuff.	4.5
1324	Lou Pepe - Framboise	"Beautiful red slightly pinkish color with a thin head.
Sour aroma with notes of raspberries, horse mantle, lemon drops and nice funkiness.
Flavor with notes of lemon sourness, raspberries, white wine, mild sulfur, lactic acid and oak. Dry aftertaste with practically no residual sugar.
Light body with mild carbonation. It is not flat as in Lambic.
This is how a Fruit Lambic should be. No sugar residues with the raspberries fruitiness that is an extension of the natural Lambic flavors."	4.13
1325	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.. Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it.	4.44
1326	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2015 vintage, drank on 7/26/2019 for a friend's bachelor party. Super funky nose, fantastic raspberry taste and smell - very natural. Beautiful pour with nice body. Really excellent.	4.66
1327	Lou Pepe - Framboise	From a bottle shared at la fête de la brasserie de la Pleine Lune 2019.. 2014 vintage bottled in 2017.. Intense cristal ruby without any head..  495 characters	4.74
1328	Lou Pepe - Framboise	The beer pours a ruby red with a big fluffy pink head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, funk, almonds, and vanilla. It tastes lightly tart, with raspberries, almonds, vanilla, and light funk. The feel is very light and dry. A tasty lambic from Cantillon.	4.64
1329	Lou Pepe - Framboise	75cl bottle drank at the brewery in Brussels. Poured into 25cl Cantillon glass. pours a brillant dark pink color, foamy white head that fades. But lively carbonation. the Raspberry flavor is nice without the over sweetness of other brewery's Fruited Lambics, this has the nice pleasant refreshing tartness that drinks well. thin bodied.	4.54
1330	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Bottle at brewery. Ruby hued body with a sudsy, quickly dissipating pale pink head. Smells exactly like a fresh picked raspberry crushed between the fingers. Taste is like a raspberry with the sweetness mostly sucked out of it: the tartness from the natural innoculation complements the inherent raspberry tartness very well. Medium bodied with a lingering fruity character. Complex and elegant. 93/100	4.61
1331	Lou Pepe - Framboise	08/2015 - Raspberry jam fosho, tannic, funk, and barnyard up front; very tart, big acidity, more raspberries, and just jam on the palate; flavorful finish of raspberry, cherry, and a wee bit of pepper to round it out.	4.6
1332	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Reddish pour. Tastes of raspberry. Very tough to get this beer in the USA. Beer is quite tart compared to other offering from Cantillion. Still solid, and highly recommend.	4.5
1333	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Had a 2015 vintage. Honestly expected more raspberry in the taste and nose. As the Cantillon employee said it was their finest lambic with not 200 grams, but 300 grams of raspberry per liter Lou pepe.. Nevertheless still a great beer. Cantillon does not have any bad beers	4.5
1334	Lou Pepe - Framboise	"This one poured a bright red with a slight pink head that didn't last long.
The first smell was like sticking my face into a jar of fresh raspberry jam, deeper in the slight funk and oak began coming through. A bit of acidity is there too.
Taste follows, tart raspberry, a nice touch of funk and oak. 
Light to medium body, dry finish.
Overall an amazing beer!"	4.71
1335	Lou Pepe - Framboise	a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!	4.6
1336	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2012 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip. Beautiful looking beer. Deep burgundy in color. Pinkish white head that dissipates quick. Aromas of raspberry and funk. Some earthiness in there. Flavor is tart raspberries and funk. More tart than I thought it’d be. Feelnis as you’d expect for this style. Overall, another outstanding Cantillon beer.	4.54
1337	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2014 vintage at the brewery.. Pours a deep red, with fine foam.. Smell has a crazy amount of raspberries, complimented by a little bit of funk and some elderflower..  465 characters	4.7
1338	Lou Pepe - Framboise	750 ml, 2012 (bottled/released fall 2015). Pours between brick and blood red, slightly hazy, and with minimal head. Nose takes you down two roads. Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through. Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple. Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus. I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose. Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place. Almost like an intense mixed drink. Prickly crisp carbonation. Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers. Honestly, the intensity will make this 750 ml bottle an all afternoon affair.	4.64
1339	Lou Pepe - Framboise	"2013 vintage.
Pours deep red with little head
Aroma is huge, raspberry jam, little funk, barnyard, honey, burnt rubber, wet cellar.
Taste is raspberry all over, so fresh, hay, funky, sour finish"	4.68
1340	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Had at Cantillon brewery, from bottle.. L: Bright berry red color. Very little thin head. Slightly opaque.. S: Huge raspberry nose, touch of other citrus, and small sour..  326 characters	4.52
1341	Lou Pepe - Framboise	Bottle with a 2013 sticker. Reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer, at once subtle and strong, and this is the first time I've had anything by Cantillon. I found it amazing, but also palate challenging. It's kind of like first time listening to Coltrane. You're not sure how to describe it or judge it, and you're at once thrilled and in over your head, but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes.	4.46
1342	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2012 sticker poured into a fluted glass. While this beer is visually striking with a lovely raspberry scent, the taste and mouthfeel are the stars here. Fantastic balance of funk, fruit and sour. Even a hour after opening there is still huge carbonation. A complete joy. One of the best beers I've ever had.	4.93
1343	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2013 bottle. That was EXTREME, could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 15-20 minutes. The funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip, and i'm not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fishey/rotten food/mold and more. After waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up. Very very sour on the palate, mid carbonation. What an experience this was, scary and amazing!	4.06
1344	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2013 sticker at Hopyard in Oslo. This was a pleasant surprise and a real treat. My first time having LPF and I think I rank it best among the framboise that I have had - I prefer it to Framboise du Fermier and Atrial. It is very balanced - pleasantly tart, not super sour.	4.52
1345	Lou Pepe - Framboise	L: Light red pour with medium head and lacing, turning to dark crimson on the dregs pour.. S: Light funk, red wine, and raspberries.. T: Very tart, balanced nicely with fruit sweetness and a vinous barrel quality..  485 characters	4.6
1346	Lou Pepe - Framboise	2012 sticker into a snifter.. Pours deep Ruby red with fluffy pink 2 inch head - thought it was a kriek at first the color was so intense!. Slight earthy funk under huge sweet raspberry - tart notes of cassis and a hint of vanilla..  488 characters	4.43
1347	Aaron	Huge thanks to bigda83 for this 500ML bottle that I’ve been lusting after for many gnat lifetimes. Bottled July 11th, 2018.. The bottle says share…I’m not doing that. The pour is a dark red mixed with dark brown, with the overall impression being dark. The nose is unexpectedly light: bits of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, & half a rack of bourbon, which is the only thing that comes on strong.. Maybe if I tell people my new kid is named Aaron, they’ll send me more of this. Because it’s pretty good. First off, it’s like being beaten about the tongue & gums with a wooden stave that’s brushed past a nice bourbon. Big, big wood with minor bourbon. The other main players are rich brown sugar, toffee, along with smoke-tinged maple & just a touch of booze. Exceedingly smooth & sweet. 500ML is the correct serving size for this baseball player..  1,041 characters	4.13
1348	Aaron	Appearance - Pours muddy brown with a nice fluffy tan head that quickly settles to a rocky ring. No lacing.. Aroma - Tons of brown sugar, bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, oak, caramel, vanilla wow so much barrel.. Taste - Rich caramel and toffee, great bourbon and oak, brown sugar, raisins, tobacco absolutely no alcohol other than the bourbon flavors super smooth flavors..  578 characters	4.93
1349	Aaron	"Batch 1
Bottled April 2014
Poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep brown color, nearly opaque, with a one-finger foamy off-white head that has short retention before settling into a ring around the glass. S- The two years in a bourbon barrel is immediately noticed, as there is a huge oaky bourbon note on the nose, as well as barrel juice, caramel and woody vanilla. Beyond the barrel, notes of the base beer start to poke through; raisins, figs & maraschino cherries, as well as brown sugar, molasses & pipe tobacco. Undertones of port wine and fruitcake.  1,303 characters"	4.8
1350	Aaron	Tasted from bottle. Pours a dark ruby brown. Caramel and molasses on aroma. Sticky thick mouthfeel. Flavors of caramel, brown sugar, dates, raisins, butterscotch. Incredible English barleywine.	4.75
1351	Aaron	So wow, honestly one the finest BA Barleywines I have every had.... Poured into a 13 oz Game Of Thrones Glass aged for 2 years in bourbon barrels bottled in the last two months. Pours a gorgeous chestnut with a 2 plus finger off white head that leaves a few thin wisps of lace. 4.75. Smell starts with Oaked woody bourbon, chestnut, vanilla, toffee, caramel, dates, hard cider, and a little more booze that tickles and warms the nose. 4.5. Taste follows bold vanilla bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, nutty, biscuity grain, and again the warming booze shows up and warms me belly! 4.5.  932 characters	4.52
1352	Aaron	"Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light.
Nose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background.
Feel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting.
Oh and $4 for 4oz glass????
Absurdly good beer and very accessible cost.
Barreled EBW is one of my favorite styles ... and Aaron is without question the best I’ve ever had.
Masterpiece."	5
1353	Aaron	Bottle. I have been waiting for this bitch for ages. I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had.	4.75
1354	Aaron	Opaque chestnut brown with a moderate fuzzy tan blanket that slowly settles to the thinnest ring and a smooth slick surface. A tilt leaves an impressive span of clear legs on the glass.. The aroma has swirls of vanilla and caramel, even as the glass sits further away. Coming in close, charred oak and aged date pair with toffee and a distinctly maple-esque bourbon warmth.. Taste is just as sweet and decadent as the nose sounds. Belly warming caramel frosting is lifted by Jack and Coke--it sounds odd and maybe off-putting, but it's light on the palate, helping its drinkability. Heavier notes of dark fruit and vanilla marshmallow fluff are again countered by sweet, light and even floral fig, which all begins to transform into fresh coconut on the exhale, especially as it warms..  1,204 characters	4.32
1355	Aaron	"A: Pours a deep murky brown color with a beige colored head. Head is somewhat creamy, has very decent volume considering the aging done on this beer but dissipates quite quickly to a ring.. S: This beer really needs to not be ice cold for the nose to open. Still, it's pretty faint. There are notes of leather, peacans, vanilla, pepper, oak, caramel and light smoke. Quite a bit of raisins, dates and figs and maybe even dried apricot? Very nice and coherent but pretty low on intensity.. T: What it lacks in smell intensity, it fucking gives back in taste. Jesus this beer is insane. It's insanely tasty with a ton of raisins, figs, dates and yes dried apricots. You have a ton of caramel, toffee, vanilla, smoke, very smooth oak, light pepper, super strong vanilla, leather and peacans. It's insanely complex and incredibly coherent. If I could give this beer a 6 I would. Taste wise, it has NO faults (enough for me to give a 5 on its own) and is absolutely spectacular in the mouth with its intensity of flavors while still being very drinkable.
EDIT: Saw someone somewhere say this beer had creme brulee notes and I agree 100%. There is a definite lactose like creaminess in the flavors that are very much there..  2,044 characters"	4.75
1356	Aaron	Pours thick to a teku, nearly-opaque dark brown with ruby highlights. Half a finger of head, with a persistent thick dusting that lingers around the rim and is revitalized by swirling. Redolent on the nose, vanilla and brown sugar with bourbon spice on top. Plum, tobacco, and raisin join the fray on the palate. Delicate, richly textured and complex, with a lot of barrel character lurking. Tremendous on every dimension.	4.68
1357	Aaron	"4 oz. onsite, ""2015 Aaron"". Nice deep maple-syrup color in the glass, small ring of foam clings where the liquid meets the edge of the glass.. Nose isn't huge but I'm getting primarily caramel/burnt sugar, dark stone fruits, something resembling maple syrup, but couldn't find the bourbon..  1,020 characters"	4.59
1358	Aaron	12/2016 - Freshly acquired and immediately enjoyed; so much raisin, plum, tobacco, some apple brandy (not as much bourbon) on the nose; big, boozy plum and tobacco on the palate; semisweet, fairly dry finish.	4.62
1359	Aaron	on nose is oak, vanilla, caramel, leather, bourbon, and very subdued booze. palate is massive sugary dark fruits. plum, cherry, fig, spice, raisin, brown sugar roasted almonds, marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, bourbon. the complexity is rich in this one, and im probably not able to pick out all the fruity and spiced notes because this is a style i dont drink often. regardless it is clear that the base beer integrates beautifully with bourbon character, and the overall result is immensely complex and smooth - an unbelievably delicious offering.	4.8
1360	Aaron	Poured from fridge temp into a snifter. Pours a dark murky brown with quickly dissipating tan head. Nose is very bourbon forward, with notes of nuts, grapes, toffee, brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Feels like a 15 year old English barley wine laced with bourbon. Has those amazing bourbon notes, along with caramel, brown sugar, maple, cherries, and figs. Has a syrupy feel to it. It tastes great, but I must say it is not my favorite BA barley wine. That's not to say this isn't amazing - just didn't live up to the hype. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Overall, a great BA barley wine and worth seeking out if this is your style.	4.34
1361	Aaron	Certainly not a bad beer but I find Barleywines too sweet for my liking and this one was no different. I also didn’t notice a massive difference between this and other barleywines from local brewers	4
1362	Aaron	Batch 2 (2016).. A: Pours a deep amber with some brown highlights. A ring of off white head dissipates quickly. No lacing.. S: Plum, cherry, and raisin in the forefront with light toffee, chocolate, and sherry. A whisp of oak and bourbon are fairly well integrated, and a bit of alcohol peaks through..  841 characters	4.58
1363	Aaron	taster at last night's share.Pours out a ruddy amber capped with a beige head. Sweet malty aroma, raisins,, woody notes, booze. Taste is a nicely blended sweetness, bourbon more prominent, nice feel.	3.97
1364	Aaron	"Look: ruby brown with a 1 inch thick khaki head.
Smell: big brown sugar and dark dried fruits fallowed by a strong barrel presence.
Taste: malt, brown sugar, dried dark fruit, subtle barrel finish
Feel: medium body, light carbination with a very subtle bourbob burn at the end
Overall this is absolutly insane.... i dont like barleywine but this was amazing"	4.66
1365	Aaron	This one pours a nice looking brown/ruby with a thin head that breaks into a cap and collar. The cap doesn't last long, and the collar leaves some minor lacing in its wake.. The smell is divine. Sweetness leads the way, with brown sugar and dark fruits. Then you get a touch of barrel notes, and it finishes off with mild hops.. Taste is like the nose, being led by the sweetness. in spite of a strong sweetness, there is a nice balance with the barrel notes, which is quite subtle, and then the hops finish. This is a real enjoyable sipper..  973 characters	4.72
1366	Aaron	"Look: Mahogany brown with big fluffy white head. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Sweet maple, raisins, brown sugar, bourbon heat, caramel, and toffee.
Taste: Very sweet, maple, raisins, brown sugar, oats, bourbon heat, caramel and toffee.
Mouthfeel: Medium full and sticky.
Overall: A great barleywine, my favorite one so far. Just a little too sweet."	4.68
1367	Aaron	I've not had a ton of HF beers, but everyone I've had is delicious and this was no exception. An aroma of bourbon and stone fruits and the taste was smooth bourbon, stone fruit and brown sugar. Probably one of the best English style BW I've had the pleasure of having.	4.84
1368	Aaron	Pours a dark brown color with a small beige head, collapsing to a small ring of lacing.. Smells of toffee, melting caramel, rose water, toasty oak and a hint of molasses. This is definitely on the sweeter side, with a rustic, wheat and malt backbone, adding a nice depth to the aromas. Develops a strong bourbon presence, which goes perfectly well with the other components of the nose.. Drinks fairly thick and silk, with almost no carbonation, revealing the beers heavy body in a perfect way..  1,048 characters	3.92
1369	Aaron	Deep brown pour, reddish hues, smaller offwhite head that bubbles out, lighter carbonation. Aroma of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, vanilla, whiskey - just fantastic. Sweet caramel up front, bourbon,vanilla, toffee, slight fruit. Medium body with low carbonation, no alcohol heat whatsoever. I didnt want this bottle to end.	4.76
1370	Aaron	Had on tap. Pretty close to a perfect execution of the english barleywine style with the american bourbon aging flare incorporated beautifully. The feel and smell are mesmerizing with their richness and complexity. All aspects, including the taste, have the barrel character meld wonderfully with the barleywine malt, barley and yeast. Bravo!	4.64
1371	Aaron	Bottle gifted from a friend; truly blown away by the generosity. Stored in appropriate conditions for a month or so before cracking it open during the holidays.. Garnet and earthen-brown colored pour with a quick head of white foam that fades into faint wisps.. Aroma of roasted malt, sweet dark fruits, toffee, molasses, oak and bourbon. Light hint of candied fruit and Werther's Original. Malt and oak figure prominently..  1,075 characters	4.34
1372	Sip Of Sunshine	Pours a semi translucent deep golden, with a very healthy creamy 3 finger head. Smell citrus, malts,earthy,floral,piney scent. Taste is reminiscent of hops,berries,grapefruit,almost a mild vanilla. Feels perfect , right amount of carbonation, creamy head dollops, medium bodied,finishes juicy. Overall the current rating of this beer says a lot. Not too many 100 ratings out there. Home run-	4.51
1373	Sip Of Sunshine	Copper colored with a fingernail of off white on top. Light, soapy lacing on the glass. The aroma is of grassy to earthy to vegetal hops with a kiss of honey and light malt. I’m tasting pine to vegetal hops. The mouth is very smooth, crisp, and refreshing.	4.39
1374	Sip Of Sunshine	11 2 2019 drinking fresh and stored cold canned 9/24 I had this summer of 2017 off memory and went completely nuts about it stouting it was my #1 all time. It is in my top 20 still. I do think the recipe changed slightly more piney and less juicy and the maple syrup flavor is different which i think is probably a variable in this beer but maybe it just tasted better in the hot sun. Can is different and it tastes darker. Still a great beer but curious about variations could be the maple or more pine hops and light on citra.	4.59
1375	Sip Of Sunshine	This was the 1st brew I had of the big boy IPA's and it still doesn't disappoint. I get upset when people diss this fantastic beer, it was one of the 1st and many good ones have come up the pike, but if there was an IPA Hall of Fame started, this would be a 1st ballot beer!	4.75
1376	Sip Of Sunshine	Slightly hazy burnt golden body with bubbly white head. Citrus rind, papaya, pine, spearmint, lemon skin in the nose. Tastes of citrus rind, pine, spearmint, lemon skin, papaya, fruit gives way to hop bitterness at the finish. Heavy bodied with medium carb.	4.34
1377	Sip Of Sunshine	Canned 2/26/25; drank 3/12/15 @ the Yarchives.. See-through yellow appearance.. Huge off-white head; a curtain of tree-rung lace..  393 characters	3.75
1378	Sip Of Sunshine	Canned 8/29/19. It is a crowded IPA market right now, not just in quantity but in quality. Plenty of well crafted, top-tier options on the shelves in PA. This ranks among them. It's a fresh, bountiful fruit salad with low bitterness and scant malt sweetness.	4.36
1379	Sip Of Sunshine	A: slightly murky burnt orange color with some amber and copper notes, and a 1/2 finger fluffy off-white head. S: big juicy pineapple, mango, apricot, dragonfruit, and crackers. Strawberry, grass, and a hint of pine. More pineapple and mango close this out. Extremely juicy aroma. T: mango, clementines, creamsicle, pineapple, pine, and grapefruit upfront. Some sweet earthy hops, and pine behind that. Tangerine and candied apricot behind that. Dry crackers and a touch of sticky sweet malt close this out.  800 characters	4.31
1380	Sip Of Sunshine	Picked up a four-pack today from the Global Beverage Warehouse in Ellsworth, ME for $16.99. Canned on 8-13-19; consumed on 8-28-19 - a toast to my bro @Sunsjammer - happy birthday bro - i am sure you will approve of this brew!. Beer poured a deep golden with a very nice white head that is leaving lacing behind.. Nose is fragrant with mango, pineapple, and orange..  774 characters	4.46
1381	Sip Of Sunshine	This beer gets hyped up so much, and boy did it fail to live up to the hype. Sure it's a good beer. But calling it world class is a load of garbage. Just your classic ipa, bitter hint of citrus but just not too interesting. Definitely not warranting of the top rating it gets.. Immediately upon opening I notices the smell wasn't anything to write home about, bringing the subtle citrus notes but again nothing significant. Body felt really light and the citrus in there wasn't as significant as I thought or as was touted. Good beer nowhere near the price and attention it gets.	3.85
1382	Sip Of Sunshine	"16oz can dated ""30JUL19,"" reviewed on 8/10/19. Slightly hazy, golden in color. Citrusy, floral aroma that's very muted and disappointing. It smells like your average west coast IPA. I'm getting no tropical fruit notes at all, and this is a fairly fresh can. The flavor profile follows suit -- fairly dry, moderate apparently bitterness, not at all ""juicy."" Grassy, pithy, and other associated flavor notes that you would associate with what are now considered ""classic"" American IPAs.. I'm wondering if there was a canning mixup here, because this was a major disappointment. For years, SoS has been a top ranked DIPA, and I was excited that it was finally getting distributed to NJ. If this four-pack is truly indicative of the beer, and not an aberration, then it's nothing more than a run of the mill DIPA. If you're looking for a juicy DIPA, then Two Juicy, also brewed at Two Roads, is a much better way to spend your money."	3.41
1383	Sip Of Sunshine	On the lighter side of golden , not hazy with a nice thick and shrinking white head. Citrus first, fruity behind nose. I’m sure at one time this was ground breaking stuff. Ok, the first thing that strikes me is the thickness and fullness of flavor. This puppy is more malty than I would have expected, more west coast in that respect. A bit more bitter than the New England styles I’m trying these days. The feel and lesser carbonation is spot on with this beer. Good stuff.	4.22
1384	Sip Of Sunshine	Pours a mostly clear albeit cloudy orange color. Bright and bronzed. Thin velvety white foamy head dissipates somewhat but never completely.. Bright aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, and a strong malty backbone on the aroma.. Taste follows the nose with immediate notes of orange, orange rind, pine, sap, and grapefruit giving way to a strong malty backbone with caramel notes. Strong piney bitterness starts on the back end and lingers into the finish..  708 characters	4.26

1386	Sip Of Sunshine	"16oz can into IPA glass
Canned on 6/26 (about 3 weeks old)
Pours a shade darker than gold with big fluffy white head
Awesome aroma of malt and hops, picking up some grapefruit, white peach, lychee
Taste follows with a light but strong backboned malt, and all sorts of awesome hop goodness, I taste candied grapefruit and it's awesome, and a never ending finish
The feel is nice and crisp faint alcohol
Overall this beer is amazing, I want to say hop cotton candy, how does that sound?"	4.5
1387	Sip Of Sunshine	16 oz can. clear, yellow golden in color. white head. big fruity and foral hop aroma. similar flavor, but much malt component. fairly bitter. thin to medium bodied.	4.06
1388	Sip Of Sunshine	"Look: Slightly hazy amber with a cream-colored head.
Smell: Bubblegum, mango, pineapple, grapefruit. Spicy herbal hop aroma.
Taste: Light grapefruit/lemon citrus and tropical fruit. Mango and bubblegum. Just the right amount of herbal hop bitterness on the finish. Clean, balanced, and delicious.
Feel: Light- to medium-bodied, tingly carbonation.
Overall: This is a real winner -- can't think of anything bad to say about this beer."	4.52
1389	Sip Of Sunshine	On tap in Maine.. A: Hazy apricot with some slightly retaining head. On point for the style.. S: Tons of bright floral hops, grapefruit, fruit rind..  330 characters	4.61
1390	Sip Of Sunshine	Found this fresh randomly in a shop in Philly.. Was super excited to see this and had to buy 2 4packs (even though $20 a 4pack is obscene). A very good beer but not nearly as good as I expected this to be. I've had better homebrew and local IPAs. It's damn good but not what I was expecting	4.58
1391	Sip Of Sunshine	This is my favorite readily available (sort of ...) IPA. Living in MA, it's easy to find locally if you find out what day the distributor makes a drop off at your local liquor store. As a hater of juicy IPA beers, I like the lemon and resin combination of this. It has to be fresh and cold ... if its warm or even lukewarm it can be as harsh as lemon pledge. However, ice cold, there isn't another beer I crave as much.. It also packs a punch ... one can and I am feeling light and fuzzy. It's a great sipping beer with a mouthfeel on the light side. The smell is nothing to write home about ... it is yeasty smelling with a hint of juniper. The taste is much, much better.. I am so glad this is getting easier to find in cans. On draft, its still a bit of a unicorn outside Vermont or Hartford. The price is rising along with its availability but it's worth it for such a fresh tasting and finely blended smooth beer. I'll always try to keep a 4 pack in the fridge.	4.86
1392	Sip Of Sunshine	I prefer double IPAs but this is a very good single IPA. Lots of floral flavor. Have had this both on tap and from the can and both are great - similar to alchemists heady topper in the sense that the smell is the best part (IMO)	4.65
1393	Sip Of Sunshine	A: poured draft into a tulip, slightly red amber colored with a short white head that lingers leaving good lacing, clear. S: huge fruit salad of hops, pineapple, mango, citrus, juicy. T: sweet tropical fruit up front that follows the nose, well balanced malt fades to a bitter pine hop finish, lots going on here.  451 characters	4.98
1394	Sip Of Sunshine	"Brassy orange color with an even, refined murkiness in the glass. Very thin white head dissipates quickly to a spotty film and ring. Lacing is thick and blocky early on, sliding into wispiness on relatively short order.
Not much aroma beyond hints of wet cardboard.
Mouthfeel is upfront velvety with a carbonated baking soda-like perkiness entering into the flavors. Immediate sweetness, honeyed citron and dried fruits at the onset. Apricot. Esters are noticed quickly, mainly banana and then some grapefruit. Gives way to brown and burnt sugars, leading into a mild bitterness akin to dark chocolate. Strong orange peel with a hint of nutmeg on the front of the finish lapsing back to a marshmallowy bittersweet and sodabread close that lingers on the sides and back of the tongue for a long while...
...Until the next sip starts the dreamy cycle over again.
An interesting brew full of contrasts."	4.27
1395	Sip Of Sunshine	L: Pours a clear yellow gold color with a medium creamy white head and some lacing on the glass.. S: Lots of tropical fruit up front, including lemon, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, some passionfruit, quite a bit of sweetness. Smells fairly similar to other fruity IPAs.. T: Sweet tropical fruit, notes of grapefruit pith, lemon rind, pineapple, orange, not as sweet as the nose led me to expect..  635 characters	4.02
1396	Sip Of Sunshine	"16oz canned on 2-4-19 (opened 2-23-19).
Orange-gold with a slight chill haze. 1"" white head, decent retention and leave behind of a nice lace pattern.
Bright aroma full of citrus (oranges and limes) and tropical fruits. Definite big malt bill throws a creamy undertone surrounding the fruity hop notes.
Oranges, lime peel, pine, ripe fruits and then a hit of bready malt dough. Classic IPA flavors, delicious.
Full body, medium carbonation...big mouthfeel, bright with a long, pleasant, mild bitter finish.
Fantastic IPA."	4.15
1397	Black Tuesday	2018 bottle thanks to the generosity of @2beerdogs, opened in honour of my Opa Jan.. Pour is actually thinner/lighter than I'd expected, though once it gathers in the glass it does gain some more of that menace. But ultimately it's closer to a cola/dark syrup/dark chestnut brown than it is a molasses black. Not much head at all: nothing more than a drifting of bubbles around the edge. No lacing to speak of.. Nose brings less alcohol heat than I'd feared. Sweet bourbon vanilla and oak. Some caramel. Honestly just not as strong as I'd expected overall. More pleasant and mellow and sweet..  1,514 characters	4.26
1398	Black Tuesday	Pours slick black with a thin mocha colored head settles quickly to a thin ring.. Aroma - Bourbon dark fruit, chocolate and vanilla.. Taste - Lots of chocolate, bourbon soaked raisins, oak and vanilla..  358 characters	4.53
1399	Black Tuesday	L: More dark brown than the expected blackness, and head is paltry thin with little retention. Some lacing.. S: Rich bourbon and vanilla. Notes of dates and marshmallow, still a touch muted, less than rich, and underwhelming.. T: Again with figgy bourbon flavors and sweet malt, definite soy sauce and booze still a bit rough after aging this one 3.5 years! Cherry tartness. Drenched in syrupy sweetness..  683 characters	4.02
1400	Black Tuesday	2016 release consumed 5.1.18. Amazing express of the style. Drinks soft and smooth for 20% abv. More like an old ale look but drinks like a stout. Heavy booze and chocolate.	4.43
1401	Black Tuesday	Huge beer! 2014 version. Pours jet black with minimal head. Aroma is lots of raisin and dates, caramel and bourbon. Hides ridiculous high abv very well. Only a slight hint of booziness. Lots of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, almost a little cherry, cocoa. Awesome, complex huge beer.	4.74
1402	Black Tuesday	"2017 bottle.
Pours dark brown/black with a thin tan head on a heavy pour.
Smells of bourbon, roasty, chocolate, vanilla.
Taste is roasty malt, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla.
Full bodied, good carb level.
Overall an excellent one that I'm glad I finally got to try. Alcohol was present but not like I would expect in a near 20%ABV beer."	4.59
1403	Black Tuesday	Pours an inky black with glimmers of brown cola, scant head but surprising carbonation. Aroma is bursting with dark cacao supported by bourbon caramel, espresso, oak & anise.. Not surprisingly, the barrel characteristics really dominate the palate - tons of boozey caramel & vanilla upfront, some fudge bark & burnt chocolate after that. On the backend there is definitely a sharp anise / black licorice flavor that helps counter some of that sweetness. Finishes with more bourbon heat & bitter anise.. Thought it was a little bit thin, and a tad too hot on the booze (but I mean, for a 19% beer whadda ya expect?) but I liked that it wasn’t just a sweet bomb and had some earthier notes.	4.62
1404	Black Tuesday	"Had a glass at Bruery Terreaux last night.. Look: pitch black
Smell: coffee, bourbon, some maple
Taste: sweet, not a super strong alcohol burn.
Feel: full of body, not thin. I've recently tried some Founders CBS (shared a 750 bottle) and KBS (12 oz bottle). Both are great, but Black Tuesday has got more complexity."	5
1405	Black Tuesday	Black as tar. Dark roasted chocolate and nuts. Doesn’t drink like 19%. Love the aftertaste and it feels coating and smooth. Abv does not allow for lacing at all.	4.55
1406	Black Tuesday	03/2014 - 2011 vintage - Wow, this is boozy but amazing! Bourbon, wood, caramel nose; velvety, hot, chocolate, oak all over mouthfeel; lasting finish. It's intense but yum!	4.31
1407	Black Tuesday	Good lord what an experience! Look is cola with some alcohol legs. Not the best looking Impy Stout by a long shot. But look is by far the least important attribute, and at nearly 20%, it wasn’t going to look like beer anyways. Nose is world-class! Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, prunes, tobacco, leather, malts. Possibly the best beer I’ve ever smelled. The taste follows the complexity of the nose with a huge alcohol punch. Mouthfeel is velvety with a mild prickly carbonation. Overall a word class beer that might benefit from the ABV being dialed down just a tad. Worth seeking out for sure!	4.96
1408	Black Tuesday	"Opened a bottle today that I obtained direct from brewery last Dec. It has been stored at 36F most of the time. I had a taste of another bottle in December, and it immediately reminded me of BCBS, but with some difference in character. It had a more pronounced dark fruit flavor. After 8 months of cold storage, I finally tried my bottle, and it immediately grabbed me with its strong, mellow flavors, and its similarity to BCBS. I now find it better than BCBS, as it seems to have stronger flavors. Beautiful dark, sweet flavors of raisins and plums, along with strong bourbon and barrel flavors, plus a good dose of alcohol. Label says it ""contains alcohol"". No kidding.. Tastes very much of alcohol, perhaps too much for some people, but I like it in small amounts. Takes 3 days of dedicated effort to finish a bottle. I'm about half way through this one after 2 days. Seems to last quite well with fridge storage after opening, no doubt due to high ABV. There is little carbonation to begin with, and no perceptible change in flavor profile after a couple days of bottle being opened.. Really tremendous stuff, and I'll have to see about getting some more."	4.89
1409	Black Tuesday	Well, lets just do it. Pouring a 2016 bottle from a 750 ml. into a tulip glass. This beer poured surprisingly lighter in color than most of similar style. It had medium brown highlights throughout the whole pour. Forms in the glass dark, but even still with highlights around all edges. It formed a very thin and incomplete crown that was light tan in color. The smell is hot and boozy with big dark fruit notes like raisins, plums and figs. The taste comes in with those dark fruit notes again but now providing some cherry like element as well. It is definitely warm, but less than would ever be expected from a 40 proof bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Finishes with that warmness mixing with some nice chocolate notes. Honestly though, I'm a little let down on the amount of flavor being delivered. Overall, this wasn't bad but I've definitely had better from the Bruery. I will give them the achievement of making a 40 proof stout that is drinkable as hell and the ABV that hidden tho.	3.99
1410	Black Tuesday	Bottled on 10/05/17. Poured into a small snifter.. Overrated. A “depth charge” of a beer. When are folks going to learn moderation?. Poor head. Thin mouthfeel. Vanilla, caramel, oak and roasted malts are al there but totally overwhelmed by bourbon.	3.49
1411	Black Tuesday	Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Small pour (8oz glass), so easily more head formation with a 12oz or larger pour. Aroma is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts with a swell of bourbon behind. Plum, toffee, and molasses give it a little extra boost. Aroma mellows as the beer warms, providing a kaleidoscope of dark stout flavors, with the alcohol receding into the background. Flavor profile is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts quickly followed by toffee, molasses, and bourbon. There is a boozy, heavy burn at the back fresh out of the fridge, but as it warms the bourbon turns to more of a warm liquid, as opposed to a molten express delivery of alcohol. The dense flavor profile covers up the near 20% ABV well, but the booze still peeks through, even after aging for a little over a year. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, grainy texture. Overall, a hearty, boozy stout with a huge ABV. It remains well balanced all things considered, but the ABV still peaks through.. Served in a 8oz Black Tuesday glass from a 750mL bottle. 2016 bottle reviewed in 2018.	4.51
1412	Black Tuesday	2013 vintage. Enjoyed with two friends on the shores of Loch Duich near the small Scottish town of Shiel Bridge before embarking on a backpacking trip across the nation.. Surprisingly pale black body given the ABV. Aromas and flavors are almost like that of a barrel aged barleywine or a chocolate liqueur: lots of molasses, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and bourbon. Feel is a little limp, but otherwise good.. 86/100	4.29
1413	Black Tuesday	"750ml bottle poured into Bruery tulip. Received both in a BIF from 2beerdogs, thanks!
Thought I should start with the OG before moving on to the days of the week variants. Drank at recommended temperature of 55 (give or take). The pour is somewhat disappointing. Brown and cola like, 3/4"" of large bubbles that just fizzed away very quickly. Just about thought this was infected. Thankfully it is not. From my first whiff I get anise, some roast, a ton of bourbon, figs and just a hint of chocolate. Moving on to the taste. First sip was all the raisins. Going back for more produced just a bunch of heat, whiskey, burnt caramel. I'm getting some root beer, Hershey's syrup on the back end, and definitely coconut and marshmallow from the wood. I've tasted old ales and barleywines that have these flavors but without this heat. If I had regular access to this I'd let it sit for a year or two. The booze is strong on this one.
Now to the most disappointing component...for a beer to be this big, I needed a thick, velvet coating of the mouth aspect. Black Tuesday does not have it. And that's going to bring my rating down by a lot.
My overall impressions-Everyone should try this beer. It has cult status in my opinion. I'm very glad to have tried it. Fresh out of the gate, it's too hot to enjoy, it needs time to rest. Since I did open it fresh, it's unique, hot and complex. I enjoyed it over the course of a few hours letting new flavors develop as it warmed."	3.95
1414	Black Tuesday	Hot and sticky. Needs to sit several years to let the booze calm down. One of these bottles to the dome will put you down for the count. Wish they made these in smaller portions.	4.61
1415	Black Tuesday	This beer is what turned me in to a craft beer lover. I tasted it in a flight years ago and began to hunt down stouts. Many disappointed, but it opened up my pallet to good beer in general. I wish I could find this beer near me!	4.94
1416	Black Tuesday	Pours thin from a bottle very little head. On the nose I smell plum and candied apples. Definitely get the booze. Very syrupy on the finish. Lots of chocolate on the back end.	4.82
1417	Black Tuesday	I really wanted to like this. I’ve heard great things about the Bruery and decided to become a Society member to give them a try. This is supposed to be one of their best but sadly, like most of their beers, it’s just too sweet for my liking and very reminiscent of a dessert wine. I appreciate their ingenuity but I’m coming to the realization that their style, while interesting and complex, is just not my thing.	3.16
1418	Black Tuesday	2015 version. Not a great looking stout. Kinda thin/no head etc. Aroma is bourbon and cardboard. Big and boozy. Chocolate, bourbon and buttery greatness. Quite a great stout.	4.64
1419	Black Tuesday	2016 at a bottle share. Looks and smells great but the booze really detracted from this one for me. The coffee in Mocha Wednesday helps mask it but drinking this one I was glad I only had a taster. I can't imagine opening a bottle for less than four people.	4.34
1420	Black Tuesday	"2013 vintage, cellared 4+ years.
Very strong and complex, great for aging.. Lots of big, sweet caramel toffee and raisin, vanilla and slightly sour cherry, port wine flavors. Boozy and full bodied but very smooth and mellow - some family members complained of a slight medicinal quality but I thought it was not at all harsh. A lovely sipper for after Christmas dinner!. Aged this old there's almost no detectable roast flavors of coffee or chocolate, just a nice old sweetness. Aromas have definitely faded compared to what previous reviewers say. I'd like to try a fresher batch, as this may have already peaked."	4.4
1421	Black Tuesday	"I've been a Bruery Society member for 3 years - and have now tried 3 vintages of BT. I've recently come to the conclusion that I simply don't like this beer.. I feel that a bourbon barrel aged stout should have certain characteristics:. A deep, dark, opaque black color
A rich mouthfeel
Little to no carbonation
It should taste like beer - with notes of the bourbon barrel characteristics.  868 characters"	3.08
1422	Swish	Absolutely fantastic NE style IPA. I’m coming to love this brewery. Canned date 10/16/19 so this was incredibly fresh. Pours a luscious yellow hazy color with great fluffy white head and nice rings of lingering lacing that cling nicely. Smells of ripe tropical fruity hops - tangerine, grapefruit, mango, guava, pineapple, lemon, papaya. Also malt, creamy vanilla, bread and a little floral and herbal hops. Taste follows the nose, very juicy and balanced and great depth. Higher ABV was very well-hidden. Smooth, sticky, luscious, soft mouthfeel that coated the palate and perfect amount of carbonation. An outstanding beer.	4.43
1423	Swish	This is definitely Maine’s Heady Topper (I like Dinner too, but it’s less comparable because it’s a different experience). 5/5 all the way. Great beer!	5
1424	Swish	Canned 4/7/17; drank 4/16/17 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque yellow/orange appearance.. A violent pour yielded a huge off-white head; strong, frothy tree-run lace..  484 characters	3.84
1425	Swish	Traded for this a while ago, even though I have no idea when since there wasn't a date or anything else written on the bottom of the can. I haven't had much from Bissell Brothers but the beers I've been able to sample from then have led me to believe that they can brew a New England IPA as well as anyone and that was certainly the case with this beer.. The pour to this was decent as the liquid was golden, murky and topped off with plenty of head. Not a lot of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this with much of it remaining as the thin head along the top of my pint glass. The strength of this beer, as well as it's potency, lay in it's taste as the tropical, murky,and turbid nose gave a hint of what was to come once I sipped it. Melon,grass, dank hops, and overt overripe tropical fruit in the nose gave me a hint of what was to come as the dry, chalky nature of the aroma gave me a strong hint of what was to come. Tropical fruit, soft juiciness, and soft hops hit my palate from the get-go and lingered throughout my session, as they formed the backbone of this beer. A light carbonation and moderate alcoholic presence allowed the deep and dank notes of this fully emerge on my palate, as this quietly lingered and fully warmed up to my tongue and ultimately to the rest of my senses.... This had enough alcohol in it but that was nearly irrelevant to everything else that was going on. Sure, lots of sediment was left at the bottom of my pint glass but that paled in comparison to the impression this left on me once the liquid fully went down. While not among the best New England IPA's or best IPA's that I've had as of late, this served as a textbook example of how wonderful this style could be. If you love brews from this neck of the woods or anything fron Bissell, seek this out. It will be well worth your effort!	4.18
1426	Swish	BISSELL BROTHERS SWISH DIPA 4/23/19. Canned 3/7/19. A month and a half old.. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip..  570 characters	4.36
1427	Swish	Appearance - Pours turbid yellowish with big fluffy white head. spotty lacing all around the glass.. Aroma - Ripe mango and pineapple, citrus peel, orange and grapefruit. The mosaic and citra hops are on show in the nose.. Taste - Damn a mouthfull of mosaic hops, lots of overly ripe mango and papaya, orange little bit of bitter pine. Flavors just explode in your mouth. Dank and sweet..  577 characters	4.56
1428	Swish	Murky gold with a quickly fading head. Nose is filled with citrus, flowers and grass. Lightly sweet with a ton of citrus. Great light body and excellent finishing bitterness. Great beer.	4.8
1429	Swish	Nose is clementines, caty pine. Taste follows juicy clementines with balancing pine/pith bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter. Mouthfeel is very good, full with some carbonation. Overall it is a good flagship ipa from Bissell.	4.45
1430	Swish	Thank you SawDog505 for this can!!. A - Opaque dark orange with white lacing.. S - Vinous nectarine, peach, and some spicy citrus rind..  287 characters	4.45
1431	Swish	Pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. The smel of the beer is tropical fruity on the nose. The taste has a nice piney resin with some sweetness. The feel is smooth with a good amount of dry bitterness in the finish. Overall a very good beer.	4.34
1432	Swish	A bomb of grapefruit taste and smell. A little too much for me. Overpowering on the citrus side. Although, It is a beautiful composition of the brewers meticulous care. Let it slowly warm up and you will notice a change in complexity. Look, smell, taste and feel are all well crafted.	4.25
1433	Swish	Pours golden straw color with haze. Smells earthy with mild fruit tones - papaya, passionfruit, and grapefruit. Tastes mildly bitter with a dry finish. Medium body mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Overall, I think other Bissell offerings should rank higher than Swish such as Substance and Here's to Feeling Good all the Time. Not a bad beer, but definately shouldn't rank to the level it currently rates.	4.02
1434	Swish	Picked-up a four-pack in an in-person trade. Have heard of this brewery before, and always wanted to try (cannot get in MA). Very solid brew, does remind me of Julius, but with a much more more bitter aftertaste.	4.5
1435	Swish	Appearance: Pours hazy and goldenstraw colored, with a solid cap of foam that hangs around for a while, leaving swaths of lacing. Smell: Dank, with tropical fruit tones of papaya, passionfruit and berry; tangerine and grapefruit pith round out the aromatics. Taste: Mellow fruit forward, with the passionfruit out front and the papaya and berry tones underneath; through the middle, the dankness building along with citrus tones of grapefruit and, to a lesser extent, tangerine; surprisingly bitter, for the style, after the swallow, with a dry finish that includes quite a dose of aspirin.  794 characters	4.29
1436	Swish	I was disappointed with this one released 12/7 had one that afternoon and thought maybe too green waited a week and still didn’t love it. Had a metallic finish	3.63
1437	Swish	Want to try another can. Dated 12/12/18. Drank 12/28/18. Looks decent, smells great. Not much flavor. Get a quick bitterness on the tongue that is good but disapates into maltiness and a weak flavor. Slightly abervesent and good mouth feel for a NEIPA	3.96
1438	Swish	The Julius of Bissell Brothers. Just released today, and absolutely perfect! Juicy, hazy, smooth mouthfeel - everything an NEIPA could and should be. Worth the wait this morning! Get this if you can. Among the best out there, and should rank much higher on Maine’s best list.	5
1439	Swish	Big thanks to Josh for hooking me up with a fresh 4pk of this.. Cannot read the canning date, but I understand this to be the 11/20 batch. Pint can poured into a tulip at about 46F.. Pours a surprisingly deep honey golden, with just shy of a finger of foamy white head. Body is opaque, with just a hint of translucency..  2,388 characters	4.33
1440	Swish	02/2015 - I get why this is hyped - it's quite good; but it isn't my favorite Bissell. There's a lot of onion, fruity hops, piney aromas; sweet, tangy, well hopped flavors with some caramel too; a touch bitter, earthy finish, with some melon hanging around back.	4.33
1441	Swish	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy yellow color. Aroma is grainy with soft fruitiness and a bit floral. Taste is hoppy, juicy and grassy with a dry and bitter finish. Overall it's a juicy but also dry, west coast-ish IPA.	4.6
1442	Swish	While this is a great beer I actually prefer Substance and Reciprocal. Lux is interesting in its own right since its a rye beer. Perhaps Swish is higher rated since it is so much harder to get. Regardless Bissell Brothers are making some great beers.	4.48
1443	Swish	Been a couple years since I last tried Swish, it was too astringent then, but it tastes damn close to perfect now. Starting from the back, there's a balanced citrus bitter finish. Moderate dankness and a hint of savory vegetable with the juicy fruit punch. The aroma is more floral, but still backed by big fruity hops. Lots and lots of delicious, well balanced hops.	4.34
1444	Swish	OK, this stuff is amazing. Pours a shade of gold that immediately lets you know you're in for a treat. Smell is actually fairly mild compared to how rich in flavor it is, with notes of general dankness, and some sweet fruitiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Mouthfeel is incredible, it's somehow smooth AND substantial. The flavor lands on your tongue with a bang, then leaves slowly, and gradually, as if it was melting, but wanted to take its time. One of the best beers I've ever had.	4.82
1445	Swish	[IMG] Poured into my 16 oz Alchemist IPA glass canned on 3/23/18. Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive 2 finger off white head that leaves plenty of thin wisps of lace behind as it slowly settles into a thin film of bubbles. 4.5. Smell is guava, mandarin orange, papaya, pineapple, and some grapefruit rind. 4.75. Taste follows tropical front to back, guava, papaya, mandarin, pineapple, and just a hint of grapefruit bitterness in the juicy finish. 4.75.  813 characters	4.74
1446	Swish	A - Pours golden orange with a one finger foamy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.. S - Aroma is mango, pineapple, tangerine and dank hops.. T - The taste is pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, white pepper and resinous hops..  418 characters	4.52
1447	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year!. The beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel (see all of the variants) - what once was a cloyingly unpleasant, overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced, not-insultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it. It's thick and rich, of course, with lightly disguised bourbon. This feels like a trick. I almost wondered whether I had the right beer.. It's great - it still lets me down a bit, after these years of chasing... still, great.	4.35
1448	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2nd DL variant. Regular DL is good but the variants that I have tried (BBA, CHEMTRAIL, FVM, RRARI CROCHET, LOADSTAR, PORTUGUESE BRANDY BA) were all amazing.	4.6
1449	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.. Smell - The sweetness of Dark Lord met with bourbon. The nose was sweet, but not cloying.. Taste - What made this beer great was the sense of balance. The cloying, soy sauce-like, sweetness that many associate with regular Dark Lord is balanced with bourbon. What became of the combination is smooth sticky heat..  625 characters	4.9
1450	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2016 vintage (released spring 2016); drank 12/14/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Midnight black appearance.. Almost no khaki head; no lace..  392 characters	4.92
1451	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Opened a 2012 version on September 25th for anniversary. I love how the Bourbon scaled back some of the sweetness you encounter with the base Dark Lord. 6 years of age on the bottle and it held up extremely well.	4.75
1452	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Tasted from 2016 bottle. Thick and chewy. Not overly Bourbon on taste but definitely on the nose along with caramel, molasses, vanilla, coffee, cocoa. Incredible BA stout.	5
1453	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Stark black with a surprisingly high rising dark mocha foam. With a slight hiss, it slowly settles down to a slick smooth surface with a thin ring. Dark sticky brown legs display after a swirl.. Smell is dark chocolate syrup, dark fruit, charred bourbon barrel, pulverized maple-glazed nuts, and, at the tail end, a slight sting.. Taste brings sweet black cherry skin with dark chocolate, a hint of marshmallow and cocoa dusted fig, as purple grape gummies arise in the swallow. The bourbon doesn’t seem to come through as much as I expected in flavor. Aside from a bit of char, it’s almost closer to Port when combined with the formidable clout of the Dark Lord and his bulbous cherries..  886 characters	4.18
1454	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Rating for 2012 Vintage. Booziness was totally gone and it was smooth, chocolatey raisany goodness. A little sweet, but overall a very enjoyable smooth as F beer I would drink again in a heartbeat.	4.4
1455	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2012 bottle. Was absolutely delicious. Great mouth feel, so smooth, silky taste, smelled great. bourbon on the nose very little bite on the taste. Very thick look on the pour.	5
1456	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	"Got to drink this at the second Firestone Walker invitational I believe. And then again in bottle at a March Madness event brought courtesy of leftpaw I believe.. Pours a used motor oil like color and consistency. Very small brown head on it, like 1/8"" Aroma of bourbon, baker's chocolate, fudge and alcohol, a little bit of roasted malt feels.. Taste is pretty nice, plenty of chocolate, sugar, brown sugar, molasses, roasted coffee notes from the malt. Mouth feel has an appropriately lower carbonation and hides the abv quite well. There is a substantial amount of bitterness here. Its significantly better than the base version by itself. Tends to have more of a boozy quality than it does a bourbon taste. Really good stuff, but with so many bourbon barrel stouts out there, I have no idea why people pay/trade so high for it."	4.3
1457	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	"2017 Green
Pours pitch black like motor oil in the glass with little head. Smell is sweet chocolate. Getting some light bourbon and oak notes, also dark fruits. Taste is chocolate, raisin, caramelized sugar, cherry, with a little bourbon coming through. Thick, viscous beer. Overall, very impressed. This smooths out regular dark lord, and does A LOT to calm down the cloying sweetness of reg DL. Still very sweet, but much more balanced. Not big bourbon notes, would take this down a notch in my book, but overall was impressed. Very enjoyable."	4.54
1458	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	"2017 green wax = 4.53
Revisited for draft pour of 2019 vintage at 2019 DLD. pours thick black with no head and very little carbonation to speak of. smell is Dark Lord roast and sweetness with some whiskey sting. i do not get a lot of bourbon on the nose but i never have with the bourbon barrel-aged variants. taste is a toned down, less sweet version of Dark Lord with bourbon barrel-aging notes to back it up. it’s quite amazing. the combination of a year on the regular Dark Lord plus in bourbon barrels to give it that sweet oaky vanilla and caramely bourbon flavors. feel is low carb and thick. Dark Lord was truly meant to stand the test of time in barrels. overall, this is probably my go-to, could-consistently-drink DL variant. less sweet than Handjee, not as adjuncted as loadstar or Rrari or chemtrail. a really good barrel-aged Russian imperial stout."	4.54
1459	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	750mL 2016 bottle poured into a Dark Lord Teku. Thanks Ray for sharing this one.. Pours a thick dark brown/nearly black body with a tan head that reduces to a ring.. Aromas are complex and inviting, with lots of bourbon and dark fruits, oak and caramel, cocoa, chocolate, some vanilla in there, alcohol heat..  725 characters	4.71
1460	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	"2016 bottle poured into a teku.
Look is super viscous and opaque. Minimal to no head.
Smell is all bourbon and fudge. Smells so decadent.
Taste is bourbon fudge. Not overly boozy and had a finish with some dark fruits. As it warmed, vanilla and caramel flavors poppped from the bourbon.
Feel was again very thick. Coated the glass and my mouth. Lingered on the palate.
Overall, an outstanding beer. Worthy of the hype and one of the best BA stouts I’ve tried."	4.79
1461	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	BADL '16. 2016 bottle. Chalice glass. Had at a 4 person-4 bottle share: Barrel Aged Dark Lord '16, French Vanilla Militia '17, Marshmallow Handjee '17 and Barrel Aged Abraxas '17 (in that order).. Pours pitch black and extremely viscous with no foam head. It was so viscous, I thought it was going to stain the glass! Extremely pleasant bourbon sweetness aroma. Not boozy! It was like BCBS on steroids. Taste had a good amount of barrel presence, nutty, oaky, chocolate and sweetness. Really thick and sticky. Basically after the first sip, my lips started sticking..  835 characters	4.84
1462	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2017 Green Wax. L: Look is of regular dark lord, dark, with a slight khaki minimal head that quickly dissipated.. S: Again, same as regular dl. Where is the barrel? Dark fruit, sugary and sweet..  609 characters	3.79
1463	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	"2017 - Green Wax. A- Black with light brown head
S- Standard dark lord smell - dark fruits, sugar, bit of coffee ... where is the bourbon?
T- Just a bit smoother than standard dark lord and a bit less sweet, but still has many of the standard dark lord notes. Wish I could taste the bourbon more
F- THICK
O- Good, but not a ton of bourbon"	4.41
1464	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2016 variant (bottle number unknown) drank in a snifter on 12/16/2016. L-thick, black, motor oil, nice lacing, minimal head...one of the thickest beers I have had. S/T-wow this is amazing. the barrel alone without adjuncts is unbelieveable. The bourbon, VANILLA-y oak, and barrel come through exceptionally well.  666 characters	4.99
1465	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Poured into a snifter. An opaque bark brown color with a thin dark tan head. Little retention and lacing. A big whiff of chocolate and vanilla on the first sniff. Some bourbon and roasted malt. The taste followed with sweet vanilla, chocolate, candied sugar, and whisky. A very thick, viscous drink. Well-balanced but heavy and sweet. Definitely a sipper with friends. Great brew.	4.34
1466	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	"2015 Vintage. Cracked this bad boy with some friends to celebrate the Cubs win in game 7 since its a Chicago ""area"" beer! Lots of chocolate and bourbon barrel here! Much Much better than the standard Dark Lord swill which is overly sweet! Loved this one!"	5
1467	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Syrupy stout with a feel that completely coats your mouth and never surrenders. It's insanely sweet and the barrel aging does little to counteract this. Was extremely excited to try this and severely let down. Not sure why it's rated so high to be honest. Almost tastes like a wine/liqueur than a beer.	3.38
1468	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2015 bottle. Pours motor oil thick. The thickest, blackest beer I've ever seen. Very sweet. Cola, vanilla, oak and bourbon. Dry. Super sweet. This is borderline too much. As it warms, it's getting a bit better. Yikes.	3.98
1469	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Big, dark, and delicious - this stands on the shoulders of the regular DL (which I have always found to be a bit of a letdown). BVDL was of course superior, but I'm a sucker for vanilla, so no surprise there. This is a great beer for sure, but I wouldn't trade a chunk of my cellar away for another taste.	4.48
1470	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	2015 Vintage, poured into a taster. Highly superior to regular Dark Lord, as the sweetness is mellowed out by the barrel characteristics. Still on the sweet side, and a bit hot, but an enjoyable offering.	4.43
1471	BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout)	Catch up rating from last night’s RIS bottle share. As expected this is good stuff, 2009 vintage, but not the best of the night. Extremely solid and robust stout, bourbon barrel notes abound. Plenty of heat as well.	4
1472	Society & Solitude #4	"On tap at Arts and Craft Beer Parlor, NYC.
The color is redolent of freshly squeezed orange juice. Turbid in appearance with a layer of chill haze. No significant head, rather, minimal scattered bubbles on the surface, yet, there is lots of lacing throughout.
Intense hops driven aroma that highlights a varied bouquet of fruit and pungent herbal hops. In the 1st phase, there are notes of oranges, grapefruit, pear, and papaya. A light cracker malt aroma throughout. In the 2nd phase, herbaceous and dank notes of pine resin and grass.
The taste opens with a soft graham cracker malt sweetness accompanied by juicy notes of alcohol laced tropical, citrus and orchard fruit. Fruity and delicious flavors of grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach and pear throughout. In the middle palate, a developing bitterness adds balance, along with notes of grass, pine resin and herbal dank. Furthermore, although juicy, the palate has dryness. Throughout the drink, the bitterness increases, as does the alcohol spice, to its credit, without booziness.
Medium to full bodied, gently carbonated and with a smooth mouthfeel, due perhaps to the addition of wheat and oats. The finish is dry and resiny with a lingering bitterness.
This is one of those beers in which the taste lingers in both the mouth and in the memory. I really hope to have it again sometime because it was wonderful."	4.65
1473	Society & Solitude #4	"""Best consumed by 8/26/16""; drank 8/26/16 (!) @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Opaque orange/yellow appearance.. Nice bright white head; frothy lace..  383 characters"	4.5
1474	Society & Solitude #4	"12 oz can from egrandfield
8/5/19. L : JUICE. Pure juice. Tons of acidic head clinging on in ropes beautifully. The glass looks like we're taking a ride through a car wash!. S : Peach pit. Slight dank socks. Amazing dank wet grass. Slight hash pipe. Wow, wow, wow..  987 characters"	4.67
1475	Society & Solitude #4	Society & Solitude #4 pours a thick, hazy and golden pear juice looking yellow with a big 2-finger, white and complex head, with excellent retention and lacing. The smell is juicy with a big, clean and bright citrus presence, like a tall glass of orange juice and tangerine with a hint of mango and a mild candied sweetness. The taste is excellent! Nice and smooth over the palette with a balanced citrus flavor with a mild creaminess but not overly thick. Juicy orange up front with some berry, a sweet candied melon and a grassy yet subtle dank characteristic.	4.55
1476	Society & Solitude #4	Look: This beer pours an opaque, hazy, golden yellow white grapefruit juice color. It does not have that murky, pond water unattractiveness that comes along with some NEIPA. No visible carbonation. A fluffy white head that sits a finger high in my stemmed wine glass, settling down to a thin layer across the top while leaving a thick blanket of lacing in its wake.. Smell: Meaty and cheesy upon first whiff, with some green, dank, grassy and even skunky notes. As the beer sits for a few minutes the tropical juice notes really come out, including mango, one of my favorite IPA aromas described as crushed sweet tart candy. Orange citrus. There is a sweet bready malt aroma.. Taste: Up front orange citrus, followed by tons of berry including blueberry and strawberry. Sweet, bready malt flavor. The beer pleasantly bitters out mid-palate, with lingering notes of fresh cut grass, grapefruit juice and a pithy dryness..  1,378 characters	4.52
1477	Society & Solitude #4	Pouring this beer from a 12 oz. can into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a thick sunny d; bright orange. It forms a pinky width of white, creamy crown that leaves slight lacing.. Before even putting my nose to the glass, I smell juice. It’s a really delightful, clean juice. A lot like sunny d itself. Clean and bright citrus presence; like orange juice, tangerine.. The taste follows suit well. This thing is a little one dimensional with the citrus juice, but it’s so good at what it does, that you can’t fault it for it. Sunny d just keeps coming to mind. So clean..  1,086 characters	4.64
1478	Society & Solitude #4	Solid double IPA. A bit bitter on the aftertaste for my own personal liking, but the taste is unique given the hop mix and profile. Overall beautiful color.	4.27
1479	Society & Solitude #4	2/11/19 canning date. A: Pours a completely opaque pale orange. Tall, tall frothy off-white foamy head. Excellent lacing and head retention.. S: Very tropical and citrusy. Mango galore along with orange and peach..  471 characters	4.42
1480	Society & Solitude #4	I received this from @jhavs. Canned on 10/22/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It has a classic NEIPA appearance: turbid, muddy-golden in color with a large foamy bright white cap and abundant, thick, lacing. The nose features lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, a whiff of vanilla, and light floral hops. Wow, is this delicious! It opens rather tart with lots of lemon and grapefruit notes, balanced by sweet tangerine and other hints of tropical fruit. At the finish of the sip there is a subtle but noticeable appearance of vanilla that becomes more apparent as the glass warms and gives it a creamsicle quality. The bill of Citra and Galaxy hops is very flavorful and only slightly bitter. It finishes with a touch of pepper. The mouth feel is superb: rich and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV provides lots of substance. Overall, I'm believing the hype. S&S #4 is sensational!	4.57
1481	Society & Solitude #4	"Canned 19 days ago.. L — Pours a wonderfully enticing pale orange haze with two fingers of dense white head produced with moderately gentle pour. Fabulous retention and lacing, this looks a lot like Green. Everything HF makes is just so… elegant…
S — Orange, clementine, tangerine, green tea, jasmine, white peach, new sneaker, light diesel
T — Green mango, unripe pineapple, dried apricot, orange pith, white bready malt, creamsicle, faint bubblegum
F — Soft and creamy. Medium mouthfeel, medium- carb. Very restrained and gentle bitterness for the ABV
O — One of the best DIPAs I’ve had, and quite possibly my favorite thus far from Hill Farmstead. Shares a lot in common with Green, which has a somewhat similar hop profile. Very reasonable price @18/6-pack of 12oz cans. 94/100"	4.67
1482	Society & Solitude #4	"A-Pours a hazy orange amber color with a nice head and lacing
A-Aroma has abundant tropical fruit and floral hints
T-The taste follows the nose with generous amounts of tropical fruit and floral flavors
M-A medium bodied well carbonated beer
O-A very well balanced beer"	4.62
1483	Society & Solitude #4	200% opaque dark orange mango and carrot puree with a tall off-white foam that settles to a frothy film and a lumpy collar leaving coral lace.. Smell is spicy and peppery cannabis, even resiny at times, blending into orange and pineapple smoothie and Smarties.. Taste is tangy and spicy cannabic pine, toasty salted cracker, and lemony mango..  428 characters	4.03
1484	Society & Solitude #4	Cloudy yellow with two fingers of creamy, off-white head. The head sticks around for a good while and leaves heavy lacing.. Creamy orange aroma — like an Orange Julius made with tangerines and clementines.. There’s an explosion of citrus medley up front in the taste, with clementine, tangerine, orange, lime that again includes some creaminess and light sweetness, but that’s cut by a pithy, grassy finish. There’s a slight mineral water / soda water element to it as well that prevents the fruits from being over the top..  644 characters	4.3
1485	Society & Solitude #4	The beer pours a hazy yellow with a big fluffy white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of pineapple, melon, kumquat, and tangerine. It tastes of pineapple, lemon, tangerine, and melon. The feel is light, and smooth. A nice ipa from Hill Farmstead.	4.64
1486	Society & Solitude #4	06/2014 - Massive pine, some tropical fruit, grassy aromas; flavorful, clean, bitter, sharp hoppiness all over the palate; light bitterness, with some more tropical fruit on the finish.	4.44
1487	Society & Solitude #4	From growler (under 2 weeks). Bright yellow-orange completely opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam and carbonation upon aggressive pour. Very citrus and tropical aromaticity. Loads of citrus fruit flavors. Sweeter taste. Creamy mouthfeel and little bit of a different finish than your typical NE IPA (different from Tree House and Trillium). Hard to describe but it works well and balances the citrus fruitiness.	4.52
1488	Society & Solitude #4	"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a wine glass.
4.25/4/4.5/4/4.25
Pours a muddy light yellow with aggressive lacing.
Smells underwhelming. Citrus peel, orange juice, light hops.
Tastes great! Really thick and complex flavors. The initial impression is NEIPA, with murky fruits, bitterish-pleasant hops, and a light dryness. The endtaste though is loaded with spices, with spicy, almost savory notes. Robust, beefy, and compelling, I keep coming back for more.
Overall, a wonderful IPA that may not be particularly memorable, but damn sure is tasty! recommended."	4.23
1489	Society & Solitude #4	First IPA from HF. Absolutely fantastic beer. Super juicy but there is a great balance of bitterness. It pours super, orange-yellow with lots of lacing. It’s creamy and delicious. Almost impossible to tell this is a double. One of the best IPAs I’ve had this year	4.65
1490	Society & Solitude #4	"7/30/18
Beautiful deeply hazed golden yellow body and a super fine bubbly white head. Aroma is Citrus. Tangerine, orange, mango, grapefruit pith. Taste is super smooth citrus - tangerine, orange juiciness, grapefruit pith, touch of tropical fruit, mango. Light notes of caramel and biscuit. Crazy smooth and pillowy mouthfeel. Zero trace of abv heat, finishes with a touch of lingering bitterness which cuts through the delicate malt breadiness and sweetness just right. The aroma and taste aren’t truly explosive but everything else it exceptional.. So glad I got to visit Hill Farmstead!"	4.57
1491	Society & Solitude #4	Can: Poured a bright hazy yellow color ale with a nice large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh floral undertones notes of citrusy and light tropical notes with dank herbal notes and subtle residual sugar notes. Taste is a great mix of dank herbal nots with superb floral undertones notes of citrus and tropical fruits with right amount of residual sugar. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid IPA that I wish I could have access to on a regular basis.	4.5
1492	Society & Solitude #4	Thanks to jhavs for this one. canned on 3/12/18, drink by date of 4/23/18. Hmm, only good for 5 weeks? Seems sorta sketchy. 12oz can poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid orange color with about 1/4 inch of white head that had low retention, but good lacing.. The aroma was fantastic, right from the crack of the can. A huge blast of citrusy hops. No real grain/malt presence.. This is one of the rare beers for me where the flavor doesn't live up to the scent. The hops were muted compared to the nose. Still no grain..  850 characters	3.75
1493	Society & Solitude #4	"A bit dank! Tropical, sweet, juicy, and delicious. This is legendary for a reason.. This is my third Society and Solitude experience, in reverse order starting with 6. I had 5 just recently at a bottle release (Pulpit Rock Fat Joe), but was tremendously drunk (and had a bad cold) when I tasted it. Thus, #6 is all that I can really compare against - and I have to say that #4 is the best and most memorable of the three.. The beer pours a very pleasant orange, with a finger's width of white head. Aesthetically, quite pleasing. It smells lovely and tastes of rich, ripe citrus - it's one of the more ""orange"" tasting beers I've had (even more so than Julius, which is kind of sad). That flavor is so nice and full, but it's not a heavy, filling beer. Quite light. I could drink several of these (though likely should not)..  852 characters"	4.71
1494	Society & Solitude #4	"Look: orange juice, pure hazy orange juice
Smell: mango, peach and a cornucopia of tropical fruits
Taste: exactly like the nose but somehow slightly more peachy
Feel: full body, taste lingers. Overall this is the best dipa ive ever had"	4.74
1495	Society & Solitude #4	Cloudy yellow/light gold pour, larger puffy head, loads of lacing, good head retention. Resinous aroma, light pine, tropical fruit, grapefruit, grass. Taste: Quite hoppy, grapefruit, tropical fruit, dank, hop resin, lighter caramel malt sweetness. Medium body with fairly soft carbonation.	4.6
1496	Society & Solitude #4	Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a significant hoppy citrus that is very appealing. Taste is a bitter hoppy citrus that is a great blend and balance.	4.75
1497	Chocolate Rain	I like this variant. Maybe better than the base beer.. Thin with the mouthfeel. Warming. Semidry when you consider the style, barrel aging and adds.. The high ABV is apparent but not overwhelming. Not over barreled. Oak, vanilla, lower levels of dark chocolate..  358 characters	4.2
1498	Chocolate Rain	This is one of the finest imperial stouts. Tastes like prunes and chocholate with not too much sweetness. It also ages really well. Mouthfeel is think, but not too thick, and the ABV is off the charts.	4.68
1499	Chocolate Rain	On tap at Bruery Terreux in Anaheim, CA.. Wow. Perfect. Almost damn near perfect, it really is. I’m sure If Buzz Aldrin drilled for oil on the moon and took a sip, this is what it would taste like. Perfect on the eyes like Romee Stijd; perfect aroma like Romee Stijd; perfect taste like Romee Stijd; and you guessed it, perfect feel like Romee too. I am on the moon. I am in a supermodels bed. Slap me, baby, I’m horny. Slap me, baby, I’m alive.	4.62
1500	Chocolate Rain	Pours black withi a still, oily look to it. Head foams up to a finger in height, but disappears quickly. Foam is khaki in color. Aroma is booze from the moment the wax-covered bottle cap is cracked open. In addition to heavy booze (via bourbon) is chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, coffee and roasty, toasty malts. There is a hint of char at the finish. Flavor profile follows suit, with sugary notes of chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, caramel and brown sugar mingling with lightly bitter notes of roasty, toasty malts, coffee and char. Booze and bourbon is present throughout, adding a substantial level of heat even after aging the bottle for a couple years. Alcohol turns the finish to dry, rinsing away the initial sweetness. Mouth feel is thick and full, but with a rather still texture. Overall, heavy, filling and with plenty of heat. It's a bottle worth sharing, but sparingly.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.	4.1
1501	Chocolate Rain	2015. 18.4% ABV.. Like with all the other Weekday pours, a dark brown color with crimson hues. Small amounts of ivory head that dissipates quickly and settles into the beer.. Dark fruit and booze right away on the nose, with hints of roasty coffee and vanilla. Lots of potent ethanol, with those expected notes of oak and char from the Black Tuesday's sweet, smooth base character. Although there's that high gravity potency, even after 3 years of bottle conditioning, both adjuncts are still very much present..  980 characters	4.45
1502	Chocolate Rain	Pours Brown. Foamy, short tan had that lasts a little. Color is surprisingly light.. Smells bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel and chocolate.. Taste roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit hints, and caramel. Lots of barrel character it should be called bourbon rain instead. Finishes dry with a roasted and bourbon linger. Lighter medium body and lightly fizzy medium carbonation. Flavor is not as sweet as I was expecting but tastes amazing. The body was surprisingly thin though.	4.46
1503	Chocolate Rain	02/2015 - 2013 vintage - Wow, this is exactly what I wanted from this Black Tuesday variant; the chocolate takes it to the next level - big fan! The mouthfeel is even better, too.	4.44
1504	Chocolate Rain	Carbonation was a bit low with pour head retention. Not what I have seen with the other black Tuesday varients. Otherwise this is basically black Tuesday with the chocolate notes turned up to 11, which is not a bad thing.	4.49
1505	Chocolate Rain	Pouring a 2017 bottle from a 750 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer, just like Black Tuesday, pours out way lighter in color than expected when pouring a stout of this nature. Medium-dark brown color with highlights all the way through. On the pour, as quick as bubbles could form they would pop. Eventually the carbonation got ahead of the disippation and formed a thinner light tan crown. The smell is quite demanding and confident with booze and alcohol. It burns the nostrils and honestly doesn't leave much else to show you along the way. The taste comes in more inviting, showing you smooth chocolate and vanilla, while still having a rather pronounced burn. I do enjoy the thickness of the body to these but I will say that I wish this and Black Tuesday were both more complex. They really aren't blowing me away. I get it, it's impressive they made a 20% stout blah blah blah, but I still want it to have complexity and blow me away. And these just haven't been.	3.69
1506	Chocolate Rain	"Big chocolate bomb and very tasteful.
Great beer when you take your time to drink it during a part of the day.. Also had one during a sharing evening and that 19.7 abv was a little to much for most of us."	4.39
1507	Chocolate Rain	Poured from the bottle into a teku glass. B #510 February 5th 2018.. Fleeting and sudsy tan head, that dissolves pretty quickly, to barely a thin collar. Interesting body color though. Opaque and dark but has this giant amount of purple to it somehow.. This is an interesting aroma. Wine like fruit flavors mixing in with an interesting cocoa bent. Rich dusting cocoa powder, almost husky and carob thick ripping on the nose. Not sweet at all, but not much barrrel hinting character on this. Impressive but not sure the angle this is going..  1,158 characters	4.37
1508	Chocolate Rain	Over the last year, I have had pours of the 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 batches. This beer ages phenomenally, love the chocolate aromas and taste. Will continue to buy and drink this lovely beer.	4.85
1509	Chocolate Rain	"Mixed opinion. Have been waiting to try this for years. Bought 3 and will try out over at least 9 Years. Beer #1: Beer had outstanding nose and flavor, and is easily considered an excellent beer. Appearance was fine and head/lacing consistent with an almost 20% ABV. Very disappointed in mouthfeel... had expected something full and rich and instead a bit hot (understand), very thin (don’t understand) and even a touch astringent. Hard to believe it’s a Double IS. Almost a mix of Black Tuesday, Vanilla, nibs... and Sang Noir.
It’s not going to get any thicker or creamier... so much less excited about aging. A very delicious beer... just not my style for body."	4.44
1510	Chocolate Rain	"Reviewed on 10/1/17, from notes
2017 vintage
L - Pours deep toffee color with a thin khaki head.
S - The aroma is very similar to Black Tuesday. Lots of bourbon and ethanol. Also lots of dark fruits. I only get hints of chocolate, vanilla, and char.
T - The flavors are typical bourbon notes; vanilla, oak, char, and hints of caramel. There are sweet chocolate undertones throughout. But there is a big ethanol bitter finish.
F - Thin body, but a little sticky
O - I'm a little disappointed. The overall experience is good, but doesn't knock my socks off. That ethanol finish was a killer. This is a relatively fresh bottle and it could just use some age.. Edit: opened a '15 bottle and it's way better than '17 fresh. The reduced ethanol flavors allow the chocolate flavor and aroma to really come out. Score adjusted up from my original 4.3 average."	4.61
1511	Chocolate Rain	2015. Teku pour. LOVE black tuesday but every other variant hasn't lived up to it yet. Hoping CR is the outlier.. L - thin murky brown like BT. S - alcohol and dark fruit. I smell zero of its proclaimed additions and honestly it just smelled like a less pronounced version of black tuesday. Disappointed here..  880 characters	4.44
1512	Chocolate Rain	2016. From bottle into chalice.. Very little foam on pour. Brown/amber in color. More of an appearance of a barleywine rather than a stout. Barrel character here is huge. Loads of bourbon and oak. Chocolate was present on the nose and in the taste, along with some mild vanilla as the beer warmed. But make now mistake, this is hot and this is barrel boozy. If you don't like the heat, you might want to sit on this for a few years.	4.34
1513	Chocolate Rain	Bottle poured into snifter. Chocolate and bourbon greet nose. Bourbon on front, vanilla and chocolate on back. For a HG BEER this is smooth. 2017 bottle 6/14/17	4.5
1514	Chocolate Rain	Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown/black with minimal head. Aroma is dark chocolate and vanilla. Moderate bitterness with alcohol burn on the finish. Flavors of cacao and vanilla, bourbon, toffee, caramel and maple. Huge beer and very dangerous.	4.04
1515	Chocolate Rain	Clear mahogany with red edges and a fuzzy tan head that fizzles out quickly to a thin ring at first, then to nothing at all, ending up like glass of dark rum--the surface appears sticky and slick, and a swirl leaves clear legs on the glass. Those legs stay damn near permanently which I don't think I've ever seen in a beer before today.. Smell is chocolate syrup, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon and oak. It gives off an overall sweet aroma, developing into full on brownie batter in no time at all.. First sip brings candied almonds with brown sugar, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, vanilla, bourbon and oak. It honestly tastes like a brownie dipped in bourbon--and it sure is hot as red coals just like that would be. I'd have to say I prefer actual brownies, but this isn't a bad second. Some smokey date arises in the aftertaste..  1,046 characters	3.96
1516	Chocolate Rain	Just too boozy. Had a 2014 and it was still too hot. I mean you get tons of chocolate it's dark as night and it's thick, but it's booze followed by chocolate. Tough to have more then a 5oz. pour.	3.81
1517	Chocolate Rain	Typical big Bruery beer look. Little head that goes away fast. But at 19% what do you expect. Big chocolate smell and bourbon. Taste is fudge with some alcohol bite at the end. Feel is slightly thin. But that's how all these weekday stouts are so it's expected. Amazing overall beer from one of the top brueries to do the big stout.	4.64
1518	Chocolate Rain	A: Chocolate aroma upfront, boozy, with lots of vanilla character, followed by a moderate oak and bourbon presence.. A: Black color, so dark it almost looks opaque, with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring around the glass.. T: Lots of chocolate like flavor, fair amount of malt sweetness with lots of bourbon character, moderately light cherries and a moderate roast bitterness..  817 characters	4.34
1519	Chocolate Rain	This was an interesting beer for sure. Opened a fresh 2017. Had a dark amber color. Aroma was chocolate and boozy with some sweetness. Flavor was still a little hot from the abv but still delicious. Lots of bourbon, chocolate and some vanilla. Drank a little lighter Thani expected. Overall really enjoyable.	4.41
1520	Chocolate Rain	WOW... amazing ba stout. lots of chocolate and vanilla on the nose. great balanced chocolate on the taste. covers the booziness of the ba very well.	4.62
1521	Chocolate Rain	Pours an inky black, with a finger of khaki head that quickly settled. Smells of vanilla, bourbon, some dark fruit (maybe plum). More burnt sugar and chocolate in the taste. Surprisingly, not overly sweet.  279 characters	4.49
1522	Beatification	Bottle pour at the 2019 Festival of Farmhouse Ales. This one absolutely lived up the hype. Perfectly balanced. The best sour beer I've had from Russian River and that is saying something.	4.75
1523	Beatification	At last got my hands on this RR classic! Golden orange with no head save a clear ring. Wonderful aromas of oak, wet earth, lemon, grass, hay, grapefruit zest, barrel must, and grains. Taste is more acidic and vinegar forward, but has all the same flavors from the smell, with an ending backed by sour oak and plenty of funk, but also leaves the palate pretty citrus sweet. Not the most complex, but plenty flavorful. Feel is tart, funky and has a vinegar artful harshness.	4.49
1524	Beatification	Look - very high carbonation and a clear pale yellow/straw color - stays quite active. Smell - decent amount of funk from 'spontaneous fermentation' - slight vinegar hint. Taste - pretty powerful blast of sourness and tart fruit - slight yeast and bread - some malt - mostly sour but backs off and other flavors come through then. Feel - medium bodied (which is a bit fuller than a typical barrel aged sour) and stays at a higher level of carbonation than expected. Overall - this is a great beer - I picked up this bottle in the original R.R. tap room in March 2019 - not as sour as I expected with a spontaneous fermented beer - a bit more complexity in this one as well - very enjoyable	4.25
1525	Beatification	Got a bottle of this in July of 2017 when my best friend Jon and I visited the brewery when I went to visit him in northern California where he lives. This particular bottle was bottled on 2/15/17. Been holding onto this until tonight. Decided tonight is the night to finally drink this one. Poured out the bottle I just uncorked into my tulip glass, this beer pours a fairly cloudy/hazy light golden color with a good amount of little bubbles rising to the beer's surface. Has a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing here though. Aromas of some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit. The taste follows suit, with some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit and some green apple tartness. A very nice flavor profile overall indeed. Has a fairly crisp and slightly prickly, yet also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a nice sour and slightly dry aftertaste. Very easy to drink in teh way well crafted beer ought to be.. Eric	4.3
1526	Beatification	"Pours a mostly clear straw yellow with a thin white head that disappeared quickly.
Smells a bit funky, oaky, light notes of fruit, lemon maybe some apple.
Taste follows, lots of oak, Brett, light fruit.
Crisp, light to medium body with good carb levels.
Overall probably the best of the style that I have had stateside. Definitely see the Cantillon influence on this one."	4.49
1527	Beatification	Straw with a hint of haze, moderate to few large, fast rising bubbles, and a fast dissipating white foam.. Smells really funky, sour, lambic like with oak notes and dusty cellars. Reminds me of Cantillon brewery in Brussels. Some white wine, and yellow stone fruit.. Sour with no sweetness, macaroni, oak notes, sour yellow plums, lemon juice, gravel, and dusty cellar. A hint of dull bitterness as well..  615 characters	4.39
1528	Beatification	Appearance - The poured the color of apple juice with visible carbonation, but little head.. Smell - The nose was very tart, and had fruity notes that I could not attach to a fruit.. Taste - The initial impression was sour apples. Later notes of guava andvpeppery spice were identifiable. As the taste progresses, it seemed to become more acidic..  557 characters	4.23
1529	Beatification	"I received this from @bum4ever in a BIF box. It was a ""mystery"" beer and my initial notes were made without knowing its identity. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a slightly hazy bright gold with orange hues. The effervescent, ecru-colored head dissipated quickly giving it a champagne-like appearance. It has the unmistakable smell of brett yeast, along with lemon and perhaps a hint of lime. There is also a distinct smell of oak. It's very fragrant. As expected, the taste opens strongly sour with bitter lemon notes. There is also a subtle taste of grape that gives it a small amount of balancing sweetness. As the glass warms you can increasingly taste the oak barrel and it finishes fairly bitter. The flavors blend very well. As expected for a Wild Ale, the feel is crisp and light with lively carbonation, and the 6% ABV doesn't distract from appreciation of the flavors. Overall, this is by far one of the finest Wild Ales I've had the pleasure to drink. Thank you, Josh, for the opportunity."	4.49
1530	Beatification	2018 edition, poured into a tulip. A clear bright golden color with a modest white head that quickly settled. Crisp citrus aroma - lemon and orange. Some Brett funky esters and dough as well. The taste was phenomenal. Juicy citrus notes mixed with grassy, funky elements, doughy bread, and earthy elements. Moderately tart and very drinkable. The cherry on top was the elegant oaky presence throughout. Not overwhelming, but enough to easily notice. Exceptional.	4.49
1531	Beatification	2017 vintage. Poured from fridge temp and allowed to warm. Pours a beautiful yellow with quickly dissipating white head. No sediment in the bottle. Nose is insane. A huge burst of citrus smacks you in the face. Lemon and orange primarily. A bit of pine, wheat, funk, and tartness. I can tell that this is going to be sour. Taste is as expected. Sour upfront, with a bitterness on the back end. Citrus peel really comes through, with a really nice earthy taste that runs throughout. Pine and a bit of leather are present. Mouthfeel is dry with good carbonation. Overall, a really nice example of the style. They always compete with the best.	4.38
1532	Beatification	Pouring from a 375 ml. bottle into a tall wine glass. Bottle dated 3/01/18. This beer pours out light straw/lemon in color. And forms a thick white crown. The smell is some fruit sweetness and tartness. Peaches, apples, pears. The taste is sharp and ripe fruit and a slight funk. Almost has a burning like tartness. I am just really not coming out impressed with these Russian Rivers I have tried. I wish I was but it's just not adding up to me. I've had better sours than this. I want more complexity, more flavor. Idk just not adding up to me the ratings.	3.83
1533	Beatification	Tasted from bottle batch 7. Pours a slight cloudy gold with no head. Lot of oak notes along with wine notes. A little bit of sour funk. Taste refreshing mildly sour funky refreshing beer. Some grassy notes along with grapes and maybe a little peach. Very well done.	4.31
1534	Beatification	Batch 6, 9/11/13. Far from a gueuze. Pretty acetic nose, mostly just vinegar, lemon, and some barrel in the nose. Taste is better though still acetic, nice bright citrus fruit, mostly lemon. Low carb, medium body. This is very disappointing. I feel it did not age well, but it should have.	3.99
1535	Beatification	Pale gold and clear until you hit the yeast at the bottom. Smells sweet and funky with hay and lemon. Nice sour, tart taste with lots of fruit. Reminds me of unripened pineapple and lemon zest. Nice sweetness and carb. Really great beer.	4.5
1536	Beatification	Sparkling vibrant gold with a large, airy off-white foam disappearing into a shimmering, lightly bubbling surface.. Aroma is a mix of white wine and slightly spicy, funky aged cheese and hay with sharply sour notes of tangerine, white grape and toasty, drying white oak. There's a bit of bread far in the background.. Taste is sharply sour with a complex woodiness. White wine, green grape and toasted seed flavors mingle well with each other. A nice oaky swallow adds an odd, toasty bitterness that may be contributing a touch of wild greens..  672 characters	4.09
1537	Beatification	Bottled 021517. Clear yellow appearance with a good bit of foam upon pour. Foam and bubbles are similar to that of sparkling wine. Lemony, with a bit of a barnyard funk aroma and flavor. Not overly acidic/aggressive as some of the other RR sours. Oakiness does come out as it warms. Smooth and crisp at the end.. A delightful sour that I'm happy to try, but there are a couple of other RR sours I would rather have.	4.44
1538	Beatification	Bottle 2-17 consumed 3-18. Pours a hazy medium yellow color with notes of peach. Thin white head that is short lasting. Nose is of apple and grape skin, light funk and wet oak. Taste of apple skin, grape must with hints of damp wood and a light mellow yogurt smoothness. Pasture grass after a rain storm and a ever so slight clove like flair that leaves as fast as it appeared. Medium body with ample carbonation given the bc. Dry semi smooth oak finish.	4.58
1539	Beatification	Poured a 2015 Beatification on New Years .. Gotta love the cork pop you get. Poured a hazy yellow with a tinge of orange. Smell is that of what I imagine a great sour should smell. The tart, the oak, the nice funk really shines on this beer. Reminds me a lot of some of the best Jester King has to offer. Wow overall this a fantastic beer and if you are lucky enough to acquire one of these great beers, know that you have a good turn of luck. Cheers !	4.72
1540	Beatification	"Back when I first started trading and was still knee deep in my ""ticking phase"" of craft beer tutelage, Beatification was probably one of the biggest white whales on the planet, second only to the magnum version of itself.. It's perhaps fitting that I didn't get to try it prior to visiting Belgium and really appreciating what a traditional spontaneously fermented ale is supposed to taste like as well as its potential, else this might not have been an experience I'd wanted to seek out twice, or surely an experience I'd regret initiating as ""FT: b2 BEAT"" was almost impossible to fill an ISO out for.. Although there are some striking parallels one could draw from this beer to its Anderlecht-based inspiration, like many previous attempts to nail down the Bruxellois style in an American setting (e.g. Cable Car, Elements of Composition, Oak Theory) it comes convincing close but isn't quite worthy of rubbing shoulders with their counterparts from Pajottenland..  2,550 characters"	4.24
1541	Beatification	This review is for the most current release, batch 8. Nice golden color with some cloudiness and a good mix of tartness and funk. Will be holding onto my second bottle for awhile to see how it will develop at some point in the future.	4.56
1542	Beatification	nice little pop once opening with a soft carb feel....golden cloudy appearance. funky tart nose. extreme funk on the initial taste then a mildly tart finish that balances out amazingly. steep price and all but i would revisit if the opportunity presents itself.	4.34
1543	Beatification	February 2017 bottle in a chalice. Hazy straw color with a small head that was quick to dissipate. Nice citrus /wheat on the nose. Definitely on the sour side of things - a bit much for me. Thin mouthfeel. Very good.	3.77
1544	Beatification	Light straw cloudy color with plenty of carbination and white head that desipates quickly. Mild citrus aroma. Taste is a pleasant tart citrus with a little bite as it goes down.	4.1
1545	Beatification	Pours a transluscent pale orange with champagne like carbonation. Smells of apple juicy, slightly reminiscent of vinegar. Taste is powerfully sour, fruity and mostly easy drinking. Mouthfeel is somewhat harsh despite this bottle being nearly 5 years old. Hasn't mellowed out too much. Still, enjoyed it.	3.74
1546	Beatification	Bottle at the ol' source. Been waiting to try this for ages. Very hazy. No head. Very sour smelling and tasting. Noticeable dry wine character. Lingering yet punctual flavor. Not surprised this is a highly regarded brew. I learned about sours through the -ation series from Russian River. Maybe the sheen has worn off just a but but this was still a well prescribed notch in the belt.	4.4
1547	Beer:Barrel:Time	Bottle at share. Dark brown pour, kind of flat. Aroma is boozy, roasty, light chocolate. taste follows with silky smooth, chocolate, , overall general sweetness. plenty warm too.	4.34
1548	Beer:Barrel:Time	B2. About as perfect of a BA stout as you can get. Barrel hits your nose as soon as you pop the bottle. Although there are no adjuncts, you pick up massive notes of fudge and vanilla in the taste. Barrel is very present but doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. Feel is the best I've had in a stout....thick, moderately low carbonation, coats the tongue, with no burn. Fantastic.	5
1549	Beer:Barrel:Time	"Look:Dark mahogany in color with a tan head. As it pours it appears to be thinner than it is. But great viscosity. Stays on the side of the glass forever
Smell: Fudge and bourbon dominate the nose
Taste: A ton of fudge. Has a nice amount of sweetness, but still has a great backbone of backers chocolate to balance it out. The barrel treatment is perfect as it is present but doesn't overshadow anything else.
Feel: Super thick and lingers for a while. Can't imagine this being done much better.
Overall: One of the best stouts that I have ever had. It is perfectly balanced and super complex without having to add any adjuncts."	4.87
1550	Beer:Barrel:Time	B1.. This one pours a menacing and dark black color, with a very small head, and a bit of sticky lacing. It really sticks to the glass - this looks like a very, very thick stout.. This smells absurdly delicious - fudge, baker's chocolate, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, light smoke, bourbon, oak, coffee, and pipe tobacco..  1,197 characters	4.91
1551	Beer:Barrel:Time	I had B1. Split with 4 ppl. Probably about 6oz. An excellent stout without question; roasty and formidable. Coating mouthfeel, and a unique burnt sugar quality. Creme brûlée slightly. Would love to try B2	4.78
1552	Beer:Barrel:Time	I honestly didn't love this beer as much as I had expected. While the appearance and mouthfeel were fantastic, I thought the beer itself tasted overly smokey. It was certainly a beer worth trying, but I'd never advise someone to chase it given what it fetches on the secondary market. Proceed with caution.	4.33
1553	Beer:Barrel:Time	I'm glad I had a chance to obtain this before the value really took off on this. Quite a delight without the adjuncts that are popular these days. Body and barrel were fantastic.	4.88
1554	Beer:Barrel:Time	Batch 1 was boozier than batch 2, batch 2 had some chocolate flavors that batch 1 didn't seem to have, both are excellent, but preference to batch 2. Side by side tasting. B1 = 4.67 B2 = 4.83	4.8
1555	Beer:Barrel:Time	Pours of b1 and b2 during the 2nd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Pours like used motor oil with little to no head. Rich and malty on the nose, and the flavor comes across as balanced. Not overly sweet, with enough balance of the barrel and malt for both flavors to present themselves on the palate. I probably would rate these higher, had I not been drinking various Derivations at the same time.	4.56
1556	Beer:Barrel:Time	Chocolate, toffee, and molasses on the palate. Bourbon rich and thick with a well-integrated barrel quality. Overall, a very balanced and well executed barrel aged stout.	4.75
1557	Beer:Barrel:Time	BBT B2 - Bottle Pour @ Side Project Brewery 11-25-18. This beer pours like motor oil. The color is jet black. The taste was almost of dark chocolate, bourbon, and the slightest hint of smoke from the barrels. The feel made the beer for me. It was viscous and thick. Surprisingly this was much more complex and overall a tad better then BBT b1 for me. Cheers.	4.8
1558	Beer:Barrel:Time	"2018 on-site from SP Cellar.
L: Dark - very black with some brown. Little head, you can see the thickness if you swirl the glass.
S: Typical nose of a bourbon barrel aged beer, but more intense on the chocolate and vanilla,
T: Chocolate roast up front, a little bit of booze from the bourbon (in just the right way), and then some pure barrel at the end that I really enjoyed.
F: Thickest mouthfeel I think I've had on a beer, at least one with no flavors mixed in.
O: Perfect no-adjunct stout. Doubt you could make it more smooth."	5
1559	Beer:Barrel:Time	BBT b2 on site at The Cellar.. Perfect beer. Tip of the spear of craft beer industry. Dark viscous with ring of foam around edge of glass. As you swirl the glass, you can see legs and impact viscosity has. Maybe even stained the glass! Aromas of robust chocolate, vanilla,... roast and malty with big barrel presence. Never had such complexity and array of flavors from a non-adjunct barrel aged beer. Didn't know it was possible. Thick mouthfeel. Perfect sipper.. I think this beer has ruined beer for me. I'll spend the foreseeable future chasing beers like this gem.	5
1560	Beer:Barrel:Time	Saved this one for beer #6,000. Great decision on my part if I do say so. This is an incredibly rich and complex stout, with layer of luxurious depth. Fudge, vanilla, molasses, roasted nuts, coffee, oak, caramel, and of course a healthy smattering of bourbon. Smell not as smoky or deep as taste, more focused on chocolate, vanilla, and barrel, but otherwise twins. Body is so textured and varied I can chew on it, even with booze burst at finish. Truly a special beer	4.69
1561	Beer:Barrel:Time	So awesome to try! Awesome molasses, light tobacco, big malts, a touch of vanilla and roast up front; superb, luscious, chewy body that lingers; creamy flavors with barrel that lasts; a superb sipper.	4.78
1562	Beer:Barrel:Time	Amazing barrel forward stout. Smells like vanilla wafers and charred oak and dark caramel. Baffling complexity combined with sufficient sweetness. And while the booze is currently still fairly intense, I can see this aging beautifully. Mouthfeel was full but as usual is the case in any non-TG beer, I wouldn't have minded a bit more substance there. Altogether of the best barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and perhaps (surprisingly) i enjoyed it even more than any of the Derivations I've had.	4.69
1563	Beer:Barrel:Time	This beer is boozy chocolate perfection. Cory nailed the barrel on this recipe and has produced an incredible beer. Thick and fudgy but with restraint. I was able to drink this bottle by myself throughout the evening and didn't regret it.	5
1564	Beer:Barrel:Time	750 mL bottle. Inky black body. Smells of strong whiskey, nutty and oaky character, and almost soy sauce malt aroma. Tastes of fudge and chocolate. Creamy and chocolatey. Whiskey kicks in with strong oak and it dries out with a boozy finish. Aftertaste is just shy of soy sauce again. Heavy and slow to drink. It's very good. I say that begrudgingly.	3.98
1565	Beer:Barrel:Time	The 2017 whale in the flesh. The feature of the night’s share.. Pitch black viscous pour. It boasts a dark tan head, with medium lace that decorates the inside of the glass.. preparing for what’s to come.. Dark fruit, boozy, bourbon nose. It’s not overly complex, but it feeds from the important components of the beer: the barrel, the malt, and time itself (to marinate, of course)..  821 characters	5
1566	Beer:Barrel:Time	Stark black with a thin, burnt yellowish-tan ring.. Very woody and quite nutty up front, stinging hot bourbon collides with every aspect, bringing with it plenty of waxy oak. There are notes of cocoa, walnut, and smooth dark chocolate, but that bourbon just dominates to a fault.. The body is medium to thin and a bit sticky, and the finish is dry..  654 characters	3.5
1567	Beer:Barrel:Time	750ml bottle of the 2017 release. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pour is a massively dark black body, one finger offwhite head, fair retention and no lacing as expected. Smell is rich. Really rich chocolate fudge, light smoke and bourbon, a lot of wet oak barrel and even a bit of vanillin, cocoa nibs, perhaps a little bit of espresso, sugar. It smells appropriately sweet. Flavour is a revelation; incredibly complex flavour profile of vanillin, oak, chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, slight char and smoke. This hits all the notes and very well it should. It's not particularly boozy, but the bourbon flavours just do so well in integrating with the stout. It's sweet, but doesn't taste sickly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial in body with a nice appropriate carbonation to it that is just enough without being overly prickly or flat. Tons of flavours from the beginning to the end, an easy one to ponder and sip on as it seems to change so much as it warms. There is a lot of hype behind this beer, and deservedly so. This checked off everything I could ever want in a non-adjunct, bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout.	4.65
1568	Beer:Barrel:Time	It poured a super thick and viscous in the glass, pitch black color with very little head. Very little carbonation. The smell is sweet with tons of fudge interlace with bourbon and oak. Not complex by any means but so balance, sweet and rich. The flavor profile is just the same - so much rich chocolate fudge in the mouth balanced out with the warming touch of bourbon. Its sweet with a lot of depth that includes dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and bourbon; all the things you would dream of in a barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick and rich without much warmth for a 15% ABV beer. Overall: this is a superb beer, well remarkable for its balance of flavors, its depth of flavors and the thickness. Some may say its overrated because its not too different from other easy to obtain stouts. I have to disagree, it is well perfected with its sweetness, balance and the bourbon.	4.69
1569	Beer:Barrel:Time	"Amazing stout but not as good as pappy assassin
Yes done side by side with
Assassin 14,16,18, maman, son of darkness, BBT b1, bcbs rare 10, BCBS rare 15"	4.67
1570	Beer:Barrel:Time	drank on 12/27/2017. L-very little, tiny, light tan head on top of a big thick black base...nice lacing but not at the elite level. S/T-following each other, this has it all in the nose and palate...the oak comes through like a fine bourbon....really strong in the best of ways followed up with a strong boozy bourbon right up there with the greats. A baker's chocolate phenomenon following in line with all these great flavors in a complex combination. There's possibly a hint of smoke and maybe some dark fruit or caramel as well. That's getting really deep into this. AMAZING.  1,162 characters	4.91
1571	Beer:Barrel:Time	its amazing to have a stout this rich and complex and decadent without any adjuncts, a defiant statement here to the countless triple coconut belgian chocolate chili pepper cinnamon vanilla bean whatevers out there, nothing to hide here, no need for extras. i know this is the base for all the coffee variants, and after having this i really want to try some of them, but there is no need for coffee here, there is no need for anything. at a certain size threshold, and 15% abv certainly qualifies, something happens in big stouts like this where they either become exposed and sloppy and kitchen sinky and off putting, or they become the stuff of legend. this is without a doubt in the latter camp, one of the smoothest, richest, and most complete barrel aged stouts out there right now. the barrels are obviously special, but thats not what makes the beer for me, as much as the old oak and the mature whiskey are fine compliments to this. what makes it for me is the layers of grain and the overall density of this. it seriously has the consistency of brownie batter, and what the pale malts, sweeter crustal types, and starchy oats add to the dark roasty barley is special, displays elite level understanding, and makes this memorable from a quality standpoint. i love the slick heavy feel, motor oil going down, heavy roast already with some coffee character, but drenched in quality bourbon and vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses. i like this warm, and i like the warming alcohol that slowly drifts up front it. chewy feeling but still carbonated. absolutely expert beer, i hope to get to try the coffee editions, but this is special as it is. a new high bar for barrel aged stout!	4.53
1572	Oude Geuze Vintage	09/2015 - So minerally, oaky, lightly floral, and full of funk on the nose; more minerality, funk, and barnyard on the palate; the body is pillowy, effervescent, flavorful, and clean; wow!	4.73
1573	Oude Geuze Vintage	A 375ml corked and caged but unlabelled bottle at 3 Fonteinen lambik-O-droom. 2010 vintage, bottled on 8th March 2010. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.. Appearance: A hazy dark orange colour with a just under two finger puffy white head that had good retention and left some nice sticky lacing.. Aroma: Funk, barnyard, hay, earthy, citrusy lemon, oak with hints of herbal and green apple..  639 characters	4.65
1574	Oude Geuze Vintage	2010 vintage from 3 Fonteinen cellar on 3/30/2018. One of if not the best Gueuze I've ever had. Incredibly smooth, perfect blend of funk, sour, biscuit. The oak shines through on the back end. One of the best beers out there Gueuze or otherwise.	4.93
1575	Oude Geuze Vintage	Finally got to try this classic and it did not disappoint. Has everything you are looking for in an authentic Geuze, distinctively bold yet smooth, fantastic! Oak really tempers and enriches the gueuze bite on the finish	4.65
1576	Oude Geuze Vintage	Had '14 and '03 750ml, '08 and ' 12 375ml and '04 Magnum on 10/7/2017 at Drie. '08 was the best, followed by '04, then '03, '14 and '12 was last although it was a great beer	4.75
1577	Oude Geuze Vintage	Was a 2005 bottle. Look was a nice hazy typical geuze color.. Smell was funky and sour.  269 characters	4.8
1578	Oude Geuze Vintage	375 ml 2005. Maybe it was a little long in the tooth. Funk and apple juciy on the nose, not that sour but smooth. Still terrific mouthfeel. Had side by side with Whalezblood by Crooked stave and I thought that had more sourness and complexity. This was like an old funky cider that was just a little tart.	4.16
1579	Oude Geuze Vintage	"Side-by-side at Lambik O Droom. All of them had that signature green apple and barnyard funk but I'm gonna focus more on what distinguishes them from each other/from typical bottles of Oude Geuze.
2003 OGV: orange-gold color, full and thicker body, plenty of carb, old and musty, huge brett pineapple, shellfish notes, super unique and absolutely delicious: 4.9
2004 OGV Magnum: bright and well-balanced. Apparently the bottles had a lot of off flavors originally and they were thinking they would have to dump these bottles. They held onto them, and I'm so glad they did. Totally turned the corner: 4.8
2008 OGV: tons of funk yet relatively mellow compared to the rest, smooth and absurdly balanced: 4.9
2010 OGV: super balanced but the least interesting of the five: 4.75
2012 OGV: Paint and drywall, smells and tastes like a new townhome, incredibly cheesy. In-your-face flavor: 4.8"	4.9
1580	Oude Geuze Vintage	Bottle at the brewery, 2012 vintage. Hazy bright orange with a thin white head and visible carbonation. Notes of peaches, apricots, barnyard funk, lactic acid, mineral components, salt, macerated apples, grape vinegar, light apple cider. Medium body with high carbonation and a sour and refreshing aftertaste. Delicious.	4.75
1581	Oude Geuze Vintage	750ml bottle, 2008 vintage, poured into a Drie Fonteinen fountains tumbler glass. Enjoyed on 1.28.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, big foamy white head, good retention, great lace clings to the glass. The aroma is super frunky, excellent expression of that distinct Drie funk that is so earthy yet citrusy and complex, lightly floral and herbal notes come forward with oak, green aged hops with some soft wheaty grain. The aroma is super bright and delicate, a really excellent display of what Drie is capable of. The flavors are excellent as well, great funk, dry dirty leaves, musty oak, bright citrus and an excellent floral character lingers well with some soft grain. The mouthfeel is great, very lively and crisp that coats very well with a tart and dry finish.. Verdict: A stunning gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. Excellent complexity, beautiful expression of funk with tons of depth bringing out nuances of fruit, oak, spice and grassiness, really delicious and special stuff.	4.58
1582	Oude Geuze Vintage	Ogv 12 375ml on 172207. Pours a clouded amber color with a small, soon disappearing head, which is unusual for 3F's Geuze, which normally stays coated by a fluffy lacing the whole time.. Smells of oak, sweeter blue cheese, stale malts, earthen mushrooms and a wet cellar quality. The typical 3F funk settles also in, together with a nice lemon zest sourness, softer than on their regular Geuze. Leans heavily on the oaken barrel with an intriguing sweet and sour interplay on top..  1,134 characters	3.67
1583	Oude Geuze Vintage	The regular Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze is rock solid. This is definitely a notch above when trying them side by side.. 2012 375 ml bottle.. Everything is heightened with this vs the regular Oude Geuze. Brighter smell and flavor. Awesome Geuze.	4.75
1584	Oude Geuze Vintage	2007 batch drank on 5/13/2017. golden yellow with limited carbonation. smell and taste are funky, hay, barnyard funk, pretty tart, lemony, and some tart apples. great feel, easy to drink and pretty tart.	4.5
1585	Oude Geuze Vintage	"2008 vintage.
Pours amber with small white head.
Aroma has funk, hay, green apples, wet cellar, lemon.
Taste is lemon tart, green apples, dusty, moderate funk."	4.5
1586	Oude Geuze Vintage	2012 vintage poured into a snifter. Pours a deep orange body with a pretty frothy off white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a small ring of lacing.. Aromas are potent and forward, apparent the second it's opened. Heavy funk and wood, ripe cheese, cedar, musty basement, citrus and orange zest, tangerine.. On the tongue it's super tart with lots of lemon and barnyard, hay, yeasty funk, citrus and orange rind, finishing crisp and dry, leaving a woody, oaky, barrel flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel is easy, crisp, medium-light..  650 characters	4.74
1587	Oude Geuze Vintage	I love 3F, and feel no other lambic producer comes close to their quality and complexity of gueuze.. The OGVs I have had fall short of A&T, but are decidedly more interesting than regular Oude gueuze (even older vintages of regular Oude gueuze).. I have had OGV '07 (oxidized and flat due to artificial cork), '08 (huge funk and fruit), '12 (brisk acidity and wonderful mouthfeel - may become the best of the bunch with time)..  525 characters	4.74
1588	Oude Geuze Vintage	Review number 2900. Big thanks to JLindros for sharing this with me in honor of his 5000th review. 2004 Vintage.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden copper hue with a good one finger white head that fades to leave good wisps and lacing.. S - Aromas of huge acid notes, excellent cheesy barnyard funk. Excellent almost grapefruit like aroma, hay, very fruity. The beer just pops with Drie Fontain..  777 characters	4.59
1589	Oude Geuze Vintage	Review 5000, holy Shit, never expected to get here, a huge number, incredible.. Bottled 8/04/2004, don't remember how I got this. Pours light fizzy head that fades fairly quickly, hazy orange slight amber color, and even has good lacing..  968 characters	4.64
1590	Oude Geuze Vintage	Enjoyed much more than I expected to. I'm one of those rare people who's not in love with the standard Oude Geuze, but found this to be much more approachable. That being said, I'd take the Golden Blend over this in a heartbeat.	4.17
1591	Oude Geuze Vintage	2012 version, at Lambik-o-droom. Slightly hazy dark golden color with creamy beige head. Aroma starts with hay, dry meadow flowers, unripe stonefruits and some lemon. Taste starts tart upfront with unripe fruits, but also with a fruit pits, seeds and skin bitterness. Hay and farmhouse notes throughout, funky but not too extreme. Light to medium body, dry, light to medium carbonation. A really well rounded gueuze, sour but quite easy to drink, funky but not cloying.	4.5
1592	Oude Geuze Vintage	Replaced my 05 review with a 2012 review, because 2012 was better. It is what I imagined the perfect gueze would taste like. Seriously. Perfection of beer. 5s across the board, for my 1st time ever.	5
1593	Oude Geuze Vintage	From a 2012 bottle - A little bit of tart and bitter lemon rind, mineral qualities, and heavy funk that comes across like raw leather. Oak barrel brings a bit of sweetness, balancing the other flavors. The combination of tart, bitter, funk, and oak for this particular beer was great; one of the best beers I've had yet.	4.9
1594	Oude Geuze Vintage	2005 vintage, 37.5cl bottle from In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst (Lennik, Belgium). Damp, musty basement, mushroom-y, cheesy funk, but with more intensity than the regular Oude Gueuze upon first whiff. An unexpected wave of honey is also mixed into the initial gueuze-y funk, with some tart lemon nearby the end as expected.. A lot more acidic than I expected, and more notes of vinegar than the regular Oude Gueuze. Here's the kicker -- it's surprisingly sweet. The tried and true oak, funky cheese, and leather flavors follow. Wow I must be a goddamn masochist to enjoy these kind of flavors in a beer..  773 characters	4.33
1595	Oude Geuze Vintage	Was lucky enough to stumble upon this one at a recent share in San Francisco for the Super Bowl! Tough to track down but worth the wait! Nice and tart yet very drinkable!	4.6
1596	Oude Geuze Vintage	375ml bottle from 2010 vintage drank in Nov 2015. Drank at room temperature and poured into a 3F stemmed glass. Hard to imagine an improvement on the regular Oude Geuze from 3F, but this one delivers. Everything is more subtle and complex than the regular and there is a much deeper golden color. I'm really glad I was able to pick this one up from 3F. Could easily drink only this beer for the rest of my life.	4.95
1597	Maman	2018 batch served in teku. Shared among friends.. Thick and syrupy pour, deep black, tiniest amount of light shines through edges of glass when you hold it up to natural light. Mochachino head settles into thin bubbly collar.. Aroma has layers of varied chocolate forms including sweet fudge, bittersweet baking cocoa and dark chocolate. Roasted malts, some dark fruit and a hint of boozy barrel..  755 characters	4.68
1598	Maman	"Look: Jet black, pours thick
Smell: Oak, Chocolate, Dark fruit, Alcohol
Taste: Lots of oak and barrel up front. Followed by overripe fruit. There are layers of flavor but it is definitely a bit overly boozy
Feel: Super thick and chewy
Overall: This is complex, and layered. But I don't think it quite lives up to the expectations. Super glad to have a chance to try it, just not worth what it goes for."	4.23
1599	Maman	Courtesy of Jason A.. Vintage: 2017. L: Motor engine oil black, viscous, dark beige head.  408 characters	5
1600	Maman	Strong oak and barrel flavors out of the gate. As the beer warms, the flavors transition to sweet molasses and bitter chocolate, wrapped in sharp tannins from the barrels. Thick mouthfeel and a sweet dessert finish.	4.65
1601	Maman	Maman 2018. Pours a truly oily, coal black color with a fluffy, beige head, receeding to a smaller ring of lacing.. Smells of profound bitter chocolate, bakers chocolate, campfire and a gentle, yet profound bourbon aroma. Relatively straight forward on the nose, yet equally intriguing as for its complex bourbon and chocolate interplay..  1,779 characters	5
1602	Maman	Used motor oil black with an intensely dark rolled mocha collar.. Smell is all the dark fruit. It's really intense of date, prune, raisin, and more--all cocoa dusted, dried and well aged. Enhancing this effect is a potently dark charred oak that has a maple character.. Taste brings tons of wood to the palate, while dark fruit still plays a major role with a sort of rum raisin character. The oak again is maple-esque before it melds into hot vanilla extract and toasted coconut..  834 characters	4.09
1603	Maman	07/2016 - 2015 vintage - This is a perfect, non-adjunct stout - wow! So fudgy, rye, rich cocoa nose; luscious mouthfeel that lingers for days, plus some light smoke, super roasty, lightly bitter, wee toffee, and some vanilla on the back of the palate; negligible booze, roast, dark chocolate, whiskey on the finish. Blown away!	4.93
1604	Maman	"2017 Bottle
Pours pitch black with a thin deep brown ring of head. Looks viscous in the glass, stains the glass gold. Nose is huge vanilla, marshmallow, spicy whiskey, rum, milk chocolate, coconut, smoke, char, wood. Taste is big chocolate up front, spicy rye whiskey, vanilla, charred marshmallow, some sweet toasted coconut. Big, thick, chewy stout. Enjoyed this start to finish, hides the booziness, but the barrel notes are extraordinarily layered. The shining example of what a non-adjunct stout can be. Absolutely phenomenal!"	4.75
1605	Maman	Enjoyed side by side at a share with Beer: Barrel: Time. My expectations were sort of turned on their head as BBT was the clear loser between the two... and for some reason, I'd expected Maman to spiced in some way. Not so.. Maman features a very nice, prominent display of barrels. It's also very sweet and had a pleasant, rich nose and mouthfeel. It's a delicious beer, but one that doesn't lend itself well to casual drinking. That should probably be obvious - but by the time I was done with Maman, my pallet was a bit wrecked and ready to move on to something a little less intense.. It's still well-balanced and delicious - but it's an intense experience. Don't sleep on Maman (it was my second favorite of the evening in a big, big whale share), but don't expect the world of it either.	4.75
1606	Maman	2017 vintage. Smell: The Barrel is the star of the show on the nose. The whiskey that comes through is so smooth and strong it’s singes the nose hairs in the best way. There also a little bit of spice coming through as well a touch of vanilla, coconut, tobacco, oak and leather. Also there are some underlying chocolate notes. Dark chocolate, and coco powder. This beer smells like a grade A whiskey with beer attributes. This smells so strong and so damn amazing.. Taste: Right upfront the beer hits with big chocolate notes. Dark chocolate brownie batter and dusty coco powder. The beer transitions to the mid palette where your hit with some dark fruit. Plum, fig, raisin as well as a touch of vanilla. The barrel starts to make an assertive presence as well. I get some whiskey leather and tobacco that carry on throughout the finish. In the finish this beer is all barrel. Whiskey, oak, coconut, leather, tobacco, maple syrup, rye spice, and a touch of dark cherry round out this beautiful beer. The whiskey and barrel notes linger in the aftertaste..  1,800 characters	5
1607	Maman	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Blue Session. Aroma has sweetish cocoa, dark chocolate and dark malts. Taste is sweet and syrupy with dried fruits and bitter cocoa finish.	4.45
1608	Maman	"2017
Deep black body with a small brown head becoming a ring around the glass. Lots of lacing and foam is sticking to the glass.
Nose: A lot of chocolate, like a brownies, small hint of booze, very oaky. You can tell this is complex just by the nose and you just want to take the time to smell it enough but you just can't stop.
Taste as intended is astonishing, chocolate all over the place, light bitterness, light to medium sweetness, oak.
Mouthfeel is something like I've never tasted before, it's wrapping all over your mouth with one sip you can't keep tasting it for a long time. Smooth and thick, full bodied.. You just can't get enough of it, worth the hype, worth is title of one of the best Imperial Stout without adjunct out there. Thank you Perennial for this madness."	5
1609	Maman	2017 bottle. Great adjunct free ba stout. Picked up chocolate and dark fruit sweetness. Very balanced though, unlike purple Assassin that is all sweet dark fruit.	4.85
1610	Maman	2017, into chalice.. Pitch black, with no foam head upon pour or even any around edge of glass. Just a dark liquid. Extreme amount of barrel oakiness present. You can smell the complexity of this before even tasting it. The flavors have oak and barrel flavor that imparts chocolate, raisin and even vanilla. Feel is quite sticky and thick.. Among the very best straight up BA imperial stouts. It is in a class with Bourbon BA Dark Lord, Assassin and Black Magick batch 2 (Buffalo Trace). Worth trading for.	4.85
1611	Maman	Poured into a snifter. Nearly opaque dark brown with a frothy tan head. Decent lacing in the glass. Huge chocolate and fudge on the nose. Faint soy sauce as well but it worked. The palate followed closely followed. Thick and tasty with no off flavors. Highly enjoyable but not sure it is at whale status.	4.34
1612	Maman	2017 vintage drank on 11/1/2017. L-near-black, deep dark brown, very thin tan head but its lingering and lasting awhile, thick and lingering lacing. S-Sweet dark chocolate, molasses, heavy oak, boozy whiskey.  482 characters	4.78
1613	Maman	Near black body with a tiny, beige head. Aromas of bourbon, oak, chocolate - lovely. Super smooth, velvety palate. Absolutely delicious. Simple and straightforward awesomeness.	4.84
1614	Maman	2016 vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Perennial wine glass.. Pours thick, black, viscous, looks really nice with a small brown head. Aromas are metallic with cherry sourness and some stout characteristics. Taste is bad sour cherry and some chocolate/coffee. No bourbon at all. Definitely not a good bottle, but I rate as it is.. Will revisit again.	2.91
1615	Maman	2017 vintage poured into an oversized snifter. pours an extremely dark black with zero head. the thinnest of thin dark tan line around the edge of the glass. smells of chocolate and whiskey. taste is similar. whiskey soaked chocolate. very decadent chocolate but with nice restrain on the barrel. there but not in your face to the point of awfulness. feel is thick, low carb and smooth. overall, this is fantastic. one of, if not the best, non-adjunct barrel aged stouts.	4.75
1616	Maman	Had a few on draft tonight, which was nice. If you're waiting for the bcbs comparison, wait no longer. This is much more approachable because it finishes drier and meanders through more dark fruits en route. Think a lighter, more carbonated d3, etc. omg. mfd(oom). gimb.. Update dec 2017 drinking 2016. Keith says: “reminds me of a mushroom chocolate I had back in the day.” Which does not help our effort to decide if it’s infected. It is umami. Do not judge. You are umami. In the middle is this beautiful eye of the storm where all I’m getting is brownie and barrel. Finishes super dry. Like major parching dry. Like may be your mouth is infected. With dry. Looking forward to trying 2015 again soon...	4.44
1617	Maman	Enjoyed this with friends at a bachelor party share.....Newest vintage....I was a little more than nervous as I know that many of these have turned up infected. This one definitely was not! Chocolate and bourbon on the nose and palate in perfect melody together! Glorious!	4.79
1618	Maman	Dark black, big Rye whisky nose and flavor, and rich thick fingers coating and clinging to the glass with every sip. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. This is one really rich and decadent non-adjunct Stout!	4.74
1619	Maman	2016 vintage, poured into a taster. Bourbon fudge brownies all day with this one, couple with nice viscosity. One of the best non-adjunct BA stouts out there!	4.83
1620	Maman	"L: Pour motor oil thick in a rich cascade of mocha and onyx hues with a thin rusty head
S: Dark chocolate, oak, and a hint of dark roast
T: Burst of bourbon and double chocolate fudge
F: Medium to thick mouthfeel and ample carb
O: This ranks up there with Rare 2010 and SR-71 as one of my favorite straightforward BA stouts. Oozing with oak, chocolate, fudge, and molasses - awesome."	4.84
1621	Maman	"Supremely good stout...having tasted the BA Abraxas, the similarities are extremely apparent. Density is very similar, with a deep brown color and rich mouthfeel. Potentially a dumb comment, but strip out the adjuncts of BAA and you have all the gorgeousness of Maman. I think it speaks volumes that the Maman core stands up within the BAA product. Essentially, if you want something very close to BAA without ""distractions"" (albeit extremely good ones), this is your beer. This is a beer that BEGS you to take more sips...very, very sessionable. Bit of a raisin edge to an impressively structured beer."	4.71
1622	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	A killer bottle that is the furthest thing from the pervasive hazy IPAs and pastry stouts. An English Old Ale aged in bourbon barrels that just tastes like you’re sipping it in a 17th century pub. Sticky sweet toffee, vanilla, tons of oak, caramel, figs, and dried sweet cherries.	4.58
1623	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Dark brown pour (@59 degrees) with ruby edges; tight tan head; fairly quick cap leaves a thin ring and a small island of mini bubbles; fizzy sudsy dots of lace and thin legs on swirl. Molasses, caramel malt, musty antique store furniture, vanilla and a whisper of bourbon (?). Semi sweet caramel malt on entry, followed by molasses and a firm hop bitterness; raisins and plums, toffee middle; roasted nuts, a touch of old shoe leather and vanilla/oak notes on the backend. Medium full body, semi sticky feel; lite carbonation; slightly warming; smooth, silky tongue coating; dry oaky barrel finish. Overall, love the bitter hops coexisting with sweet caramel; complex layers of dried fruit, molasses and earthy/musty notes as beer continued to open up; not boozy; simply world class!	4.84
1624	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 vintage; drank 3/24/19 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque dark brown appearance.. A violent pour yielded a small tan head; minimal lace..  390 characters	4
1625	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"2017 bottle sent my way by way of the generosity of @FlintB during NBS BIF #007.
Aggressive pour yields a small flare of off tan head that recedes pretty immediately. Body is murky raisin brown.. Nose brings forth the classic notes of leather and raisin and wood and a faint hint of spice. Surprisingly mellow.. Rich body with notes of milk chocolate and tobacco and spice and sweet vanilla and marshmallow char. As it warms more of the middle range 'old ale' characteristics come forth with leather and toffee and more of an emphasis back on the tobacco..  830 characters"	4.09
1626	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 release, tried first on draft but now from a bottle. Just let it warm up, and it will reach its full potential. A bit green and bitter when cold, it releases a whole raft of brown sugar, leather, and vanilla notes as it approaches room temp. Very pleasantly oxidized even when freshly released, with solid grape, tobacco, and lightly acidic notes. A classic old ale, for sure.	4.46
1627	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Served at 49 degrees.. Pour: deep, deep black. 1-2 finger tan head. Recess into a thick, bubbly ring with plenty of clouds and decent lacing.. Nose: not real strong for me but I’m fighting a cold... Sweet roasted malt, marshmallow (power of suggestion, but accurate), bourbon. Some dark fruit..  1,068 characters	4.09
1628	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	L - 1.5 finger cig-stain yellow head atop a translucent dark purple body.. S - oh boy. Dark fruits, raisin, booze, brown sugar.. T - tons of dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, raisins, caramel, and bourbon booze. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate booziness..  328 characters	4.31
1629	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured this from fridge temp. Pours a nice dark brown with virtually no head. Looks super clean in the glass - very inviting. The nose....oh my the nose. Might be the best nose of any beer on the planet. Huge toffee and bourbon. Plums and figs. All of the notes are so pronounced. Nothing is being held back on this beer, which isn't surprising given the 13.5% ABV. Also picking up some yeast, vanilla, black currant, and sweet candy. I just can't stop smelling this beer! Taste is out of this world. Huge caramel smacks you in the face immediately upon sipping. Alcohol burns slightly on the back end. In the middle, there is a complex interaction between dark fruit (blackberries, currant, figs, cherries), bourbon, and nutty/bread flavors. I am just amazed by this beer. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, viscous, and chewy. Coats the mouth and lingers for a long time. Overall, one of the best beers I have tasted. I hope to find another one at some point in the future.	4.96
1630	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Kuhnhenn - man, I really had no idea. What is going on up there in Michigan? So many fantastic breweries!. Fourth Dementia pours a deep, oily brown-black - it looks incredibly viscous and syrupy, while the smell is all warm, malty sweetness.. I gave this some time to reach room temperature. On a first taste, the sweetness really took me by surprise. It's incredibly rich and cloying, almost syrupy - excellent texture, with a delicious toffee caramel marshmallow taste to it. Again, very, very sweet - but it's so smooth, and disguises the ABV so well, that the sweetness doesn't bother. Also slightly surprising - I'm accustomed to some sort of unpleasant aftertaste with a beer that is so incredibly sweet... but 4th D is exceptionally clean..  946 characters	4.66
1631	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Shared with Ryan.. Pours a brown muddy translucent but lightly cloudy body with a white head.. Aromas of toffee, buttscotch, caramel, old malt, bourbon..  325 characters	4.19
1632	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2011 Bottle. Really nice and sweet, thick body, smelled very nice and sweet. Mouth feel was the best part. Really nice and thick, sweetness stayed well after the sip.	4.86
1633	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Rating 2011 bottle aged 6 years. Very nice old ale. Moderately sweet, nice silky mouthfeel, just a touch if heat. Had a slightly Black licorice taste to it which was slightly off putting to me which kept me from rating it higher. Nice beer overall though; glad to finally try this.	4.25
1634	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"**2013 vintage**
L: pours a dark tan caramel color with no head.
S: smooth whiskey and dark malt sweetness.
T: Caramel and smooth booze. It does have a bit of a alcohol heat on the backend.
F: smooth barrel, but warming on the backend. Medium to thick feel, no carbonation."	4.31
1635	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Oil slick of burgundy, copper and shiny yet muddy brown with a soft fizzy film that can be coaxed into reappearing and coating the glass with the legs of the booze before quickly receding again.. I smell a crap ton of pretty potent, mossy wood, almost peaty. This woodiness is, unfortunately, largely succeeding in tamping down other elements that shyly present themselves as toasted nuts, raisin, prune, fig, apple butter, and bourbon.. Oh my god. Divine. Taste is nothing like the nose. Silky smooth, really rich fig comes first--this feels like a gift from the gods. Elements from the nose, such as the overwhelming woodiness, are subdued nicely, with a little charred tobacco and leather coming in, followed by decadent caramel, luxurious dark cherries and brown sugar..  945 characters	4.26
1636	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2013 vintage; pours a murky brown. Smells of sherry, raisins, caramel, brown sugar. Flavors of dark caramel, sherry, chocolate, brown sugar, a touch of bourbon and oak barrel. Sweet but very well balanced and finishes with drying oak tannins. Low but prickly carbonation combined with a syrupy mouthfeel. Just amazing. Drinks like a So bummed I only have one bottle.	4.62
1637	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2013 vintage on 10/13/2016. deep dark brown, minimal carbonation....really nice barrel on the scent and taste....a little vanilla, some oaked cherry sugaryness, plenty of caramel and boozy bourbon malts....really nice	4.59
1638	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I need more of this in my life. A well balanced beer that has the flavors and barrel character brilliantly blended together. Unbelievably smooth for the monster ABV. Bottle was 2011 and time has been extremely kind to this beauty!	4.67
1639	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Kuhnhenn 4th D - unfortunately I have no idea which vintage this is, due to a missing vintage label: stored it in the fridge for about a year.. Pours a dark brown color with a quickly disappearing khaki brown head.. Smells of unsweetened coconut shell, earth and scented wood, enriched by dried grapes and old oak. Offers a nice Bourbon spiciness which gets entangled into toasted nuts and grilled corn. Surprisingly earthy, focussing on the barrel without turning just a tad too sweet, creating a spicy, warm complexity on the nose which is awesome..  1,887 characters	4.67
1640	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Look: pours a gorgeous burgundy clear little carb small head generation, dissipates instantly
Smell: fruits of apricot, sweet fig, plum
Taste: carbon copy of nose, all sweet fruits in forefront, not much backup, wishing for some toffee, marshmallow, very difficult to pick out the bourbon notes, little to no heat
Feel: medium feel sweet slightly sticky
Overall: little disappointed and did not find enough complexity or bourbon which is why I buy BA beers, decent though"	3.89
1641	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2014 Vintage - poured from a bottle into a taster. Great example of the style - caramel, toffee, a bit of vanilla/marshmallow and some nice barrel without being overly sweet. Well done.	4.46
1642	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I got a bottle of Kuhnhenn's Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia. I've been wanting to try this beer ever since I first heard of Kuhnhenn, I've had 4D before, but I'm really excited to tr the bourbon barrel aged version, so lets see how it goes. 2015 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz gold foiled bottle into a teku.. A- The label looks good, it's got a clean and classy look to it, it's a little eye catching. It poured a hazy brown color that took on more of a ruby and crimson hue when held to the light with a quarter fingers worth of bubbly tan head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left lots of little spotty lacing behind. This is a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.. S- The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with a huge caramel aroma being the first to show up with lots of sweet malts and caramel malts and there's a little bit of a butterscotch like aroma showing up in the background. Up next comes the bourbon barrel which are noticeable and they blend perfectly with the other aromas and it imparts some bourbon, oak and and little bit of a vanilla aroma. Up next comes a little bit of an alcohol aroma with an toasted marshmallow aroma showing up towards the end. This beer has a very good aroma, all the different aspects work perfectly together..  3,362 characters	4.65
1643	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Smells and taste like sweet raisins. Overall awesome beer, had it twice at bottle shares. Wish I had a few bottles of it for myself. Another great Michigan beer!	4.75
1644	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Really an excellent beer. Poured dark and thick with notes of caramel, toffee, and dried fruit. Had great body and mouth feel with flavors of sweet toffee and caramel to match the aromas. The bourbon barrel added excellent vanilla and bourbon flavors, but no alcohol burn of any kind. Can't wait to have more of this!	4.47
1645	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	From the start you know what this beer is all about. Immediately you get tons of caramel and dark fruit, very sweet on the nose. The taste follows the nose and this beer was caramel, toffee and raisins. Not a whole lot of bourbon comes through, very good offering but not much barrel and a tad bit sweet for my taste.	4.15
1646	Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2013 vintage in 2016. Unquestionably sweet, but apparently less so than when fresh. Sheets of rich dark fruits with just a hint of barrel left. Would drink again any time, but would probably try to sit on it for several years.	4.51
1647	Doppelganger	Slap my momma! Slap my momma! I don’t want to do it, but this beer make me wanna slap my momma! Imagine a Hawaiian vacation with your favorite supermodel, and she does everything that you want. Oh my. Oh golly... Hee haw! This beer is bat sh-t crazy! Perfect and smooth like your grandmama’s biscuits. Oh my, oh buddy... I can’t, but I want to.. I am alive. Sweet lord, I am alive	4.49
1648	Doppelganger	Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Thick hazed juice bomb pour. Golden orange color... thick foamy head and with great lacing.. S: Citrus incarnate. Loads of grapefruit and tangerine. Dank and fruity..  561 characters	4.27
1649	Doppelganger	Pours an entirely hazed orange color with a solid, medium head atop.. Smells of wet leaves, ice bonbon and ripe oranges. Offers an additional fruit ripeness, resulting from papaya, pineapples and lighter tangerine.. Has a smooth medium mouthfeel, with a nice carbonation spark during the finish, ensuring a great refreshment..  920 characters	4.06
1650	Doppelganger	"Canned 07/31/19, 14:03:23, ""DOPPELDANGER"".. Somehow this is the first time I've ever tried this beer... however Doubleganger is one of my favorite of all-time from Tree House, so I have high hopes.. Golden orange pour, opaque and with a great warm hue to it. The head is soft and white, rising and forming into a nice ring around the outside of the beer. Really great lace retention around the inside of the glass..  1,311 characters"	4.48
1651	Doppelganger	Cloudy dark apricot hue with white/amber head. Good lacing with modest retention. Drank this alongside King Julius for comparison. This is much more tropical fruit compared to KJ’s more citrusy profile. This is dank and funky with deep flavor. Just a touch of bitterness. Good balance of effervescence and smoothness, but still a thick and chewy beer. I prefer this to KJ.	4.39
1652	Doppelganger	"“Doppeldanger” 07/31/19
Finally got my hands on some DG! Picked up four cans at the brewery on a scenic motorcycle trip down to RI (zero wait time as it was a Sunday, fifteen minutes before closing). Also finally picked up a TH teku glass that somehow survived the trip in the side cases along with the cans, a duffel bag, and freshly picked fruit from a farm!. One of the TH beers that has remained elusive to me, especially since I’ve had both Alter Ego and Doubleganger. And certainly does not disappoint, naturally. Not much to say because it fits the bill...gorgeous pour, massive tropical fruit and hop juice bomb, with absurd drinkability, pleasant bitterness, and an incredibly luscious feel/finish. Can’t believe it’s 8.2%, but by the end of the can I definitely knew it was a heavy hitter. But all the better, because “one can a day keeps the doctor away.”"	4.83
1653	Doppelganger	The color of hazy juice, with thin lined lacing. Quiet citrus nose, an incredible bright orange flavor that still comes across and tight and restrained, in the best possible way. The feel is light and extraordinarily delicate. So clean, I could drink this all day, but I’d need to have a designated driver.	4.64
1654	Doppelganger	Looks murky and orange with a little reddish tint. A finger of sticky head that leaves big bands of lacing. Smell is citrus, sweet malt, floral and piney hops. Tastes lightly sweet with a ton of citrus. Clean finish with a pithy bitterness.	4.71
1655	Doppelganger	"A: Murkey gold with thick foam and lacing that lasts entire beer.
N: Lots of lemon, orange, mango, peach, and other tropical notes.
T: Very bright citrus flavors, soft feel, creamy, some minor bite.
M: Medium feel, very creamy notes with a light bite on the back side.
O: A rich and flavorful DIPA, ABV is very well hidden and this is just a treat to drink."	4.55
1656	Doppelganger	This is the most perfect beer for the Fall and Winter months. A little heavier and robust as the air starts to cool. But not too heavy. Just perfect.	5
1657	Doppelganger	"CAN
Milky dark orange with crusty taupe head; big hopsack greenery with dank + fresh orange zest that settles into peach skin, melon rind + a touch of onions; cakey malts, cantaloupe + fresh orange segments, a hit of twiggy grass, some nectarine, slight Tang powder, a bit of scallions, ruby red grapefruit zest + melon rind, a slight ganga end, maybe a speck of mint oil + numbing end; soft, slight burn + super salty. More mango + vegetal as it warms, with greasy rind linger.. Mosaic + Amarillo (?). 4.25 4.25 4.25 4 4.  1,159 characters"	4.18
1658	Doppelganger	"Canned on 2/5. Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 2/10.
A: Slightly deep Orange Colour. Just 1 finger of clouds and down with nice lace.
S: Citrus and tropical fruits aromas.
T: Dry=not too sweet, slightly bitter side but still fluffy. , smooth, Dunk
M:Medium Body and light Carbo. Mango, apricot and fruits.
O: Smooth.Never feel 8% Alcohol. Although this is imperial but still soft , mild and easy to drink,"	4.6
1659	Doppelganger	"Canned 12-12-18 into Silhouette glass.
L: Cream colored. Standard haze. Creamy off-white head that refuses to die. Spotty, yet sticky lacing.
S: Fresh tropical. Base orange/citrus is pleasant.
T: Excellent balance between the tropical and citrus flavors.
F: Smooth, creamy.. low on the carbonation and bitters. A light back-bite .. maybe the alcohol trying to poke its head in.
O: Excellent tasting, full of flavors.. however, for a higher ABV, it's regular in the smell and look. Feel is quite adequate."	4.28
1660	Doppelganger	Doppelganger pours a pear juice yellow with a think and foamy two finger head and wisps of lacing. The smell is delicious citrus and tropical on the nose; papaya and mango to grapefruit and orange. A great aroma off the pint glass! Taste is juicy with pineapple and peach up front, a hint of bubblegum sweetness that finishes creamy smooth.	4.52
1661	Doppelganger	First attempted shiftdaced beer revieew. Will renove of ots teally bad.. Pours a creamy, opaque, tropical smoothie color, with a fomget of very sticky white head. Good lacing.. Big ripe mango and some guava, papaya, a little pineapple, a little passionfruit, maybe some melon - smells very sweet. Smells like a tropical fruit smoothie even with the whey powder. It had this cheesy kind of dank/yeasty thing. It's not bad at all, no. I've had a couple that really detracted from the overall experience, but this is just a well integrated part of the hop party here. The round yeast notes balance out the sharpness that the drinker gets - between the fruity hop notes, and that zing that you get right up front. The yeast complexity gives it a full sense of wholeness and even.  1,585 characters	4.4
1662	Doppelganger	16oz can. Pours a hazy burnt orange color with an inch of frothy head. Good deal of lacing. The aroma is citrus and tropical fruits. Pineapple, peach and orange. Some dank/grassy hops also. The taste is more dank than expected but still has a good deal of fruit flavor. Mango, papaya, pineapple and peach. Bready malts towards the end with some more grassy and dank hops. Medium to heavy body with a bit of a dry mouthfeel. Good deal of alcohol warmth.	4.06
1663	Doppelganger	Canned on 10/9/18. Pours a hazy burnt orange-peach yellow with over a finger of fluffy white head; solid head retention leaves froth around the edge and plenty of lacing spattered around the glass as it recedes.. Aromas of creamy apricot and peaches, citrus, and ripe mango; taut, fleeting grassy notes add a delicate herbal edge to a lush, tropical, and lightly hoppy bouquet..  1,362 characters	4.35
1664	Doppelganger	I found out I had a Treehouse beer and I got giddy like a schoolboy about to play in the dirt. My first Treehouse beer and the ratings on this beer is high. Let us get to the review. I love the label on this beer a black label with dark purple, way cool. The beer is 47 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The gentle pour produced a two finger bright white head. The head is creamy and airy with good retention. Lacing was left on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold with amber hues. Clarity of the beer is hazy from the yeast. Overall, a solid appearance for this beer.. The first aromas I get are juicy citrus aromas, oranges, lemons, and grapefruit. Next, I get toasted malt, honey, a touch of pine, floral, tropical fruit, and yeast.. Juicy oranges, lemons, and grape are plentiful in the first sips. Next, I get toasted malts, honey, floral, tropical fruits, yeast, pine, and a touch of resin..  1,318 characters	4.63
1665	Doppelganger	"look: like peach orange juice with pulp I imagine. Sudsy plush head on the pour that mostly recedes.
smell: Tropical citrus, a little bitter grapefruit.
taste: Quite dry, a little bitter in the finish and tropical citrus throughout."	4.34
1666	Doppelganger	Had a can thanks to Shawn. Overall Very good well crafted. Thought the tropical fruit tones were muted but complex and delicious. Very soft easy mouthfeel for a canned beer.	4.44
1667	Doppelganger	Reminds me a lot of other New England double IPA. The greatness of this beer is the piney smell as well as the hoppiness and long aftertaste. Reminds me of Heady Topper.	4.38
1668	Doppelganger	"Thanks to jlindros for hooking this up (and a bunch of other beers). Pours a hazy yellow with 1/3"" white head on the top. Aroma was citrus, didn't pop tropical fruit on this one, just seemed like a hearty dose of Citra hops and maybe just a drop of stone fruit aroma. Doesn't seem to be dry hopped any bigger or better than the big boys out here (Monkish/Cellarmaker/Moonraker/Alvarado/Revision) that make comparable stuff.. Taste is pretty good, more of the orange citrus but it isn't sweet, a little bit of grapefruit. Mouth feel is nice and relatively soft, not too bitter, hides the alcohol very well. Isn't quite as soft as some NEIPAs I've had, but its definitely lower in bitterness than any other style of ipa. Carbonation is on it. Its very drinkable and a pretty easy banger to put down all by oneself in a small amount of time.. The difficult thing for me is trying to understand why the ratings are the way they are. I think its a function of MA not having much in the way of hoppy beer in the 90s and whatnot. There's literally dozens of comparable breweries one state over."	4.18
1669	Doppelganger	Enjoying from my brand new tulip glass. What a nose - keeps delivering citrus with every swirl. I find it just a bit more bitter on the tongue than expected, but the taste and mouth feel are still great. Overall, certainly a top DIPA!	4.58
1670	Doppelganger	Poured into a Alchemy 13 oz Teku glass canned 9/12/18. Pours a very hazy dark orange yellow with a massive 2 plus finger head that leaves thin wisps of lace throughout. 4.75. Smell is papaya, mango, tangerine, and mild grapefruit rind. 4.75. Taste follows tropical front to back, with papaya dominating and just mild bitterness from grapefruit but is their. 4.75.  535 characters	4.75
1671	Doppelganger	Canned 15 days ago.. Pours medium-dark hazy orange with a persistent off-white head.. The nose and taste are peach, bubblegum, kiwi, and doughy malt. Medium lingering bitterness..  329 characters	4.5
1672	Ephraim	Beautiful turbid orange appearance with a little white head. Smell of pine, orange, other citrus - hops. Very warm and spicy for a HF IPA. Taste follows the nose with a smack of pine, citrus, and bitterness. Leaves behind a slight bready taste. Feel is superb for a 10% beer. Slightly chewey and so refreshing. Overall, this is a great IPA that is reminiscent of Pliny, but has the color and some of the nose and taste of a NEIPA	4.49
1673	Ephraim	Bright, refereshing, peppery, orange citrus, piney, balanced bitterness, nice lingering bitterness. Big, boozy, but so well balanced. Very drinkable for 10%. Great beer.	4.6
1674	Ephraim	Foggy burnt gold with a fluffy short persistent blanket.. Spicier, sharper and more dank than most of Hill's other IPAs, there's notes of black pepper and a noticeable boozy triple sec character I'm really surprised to experience in a Hill IPA, but at least it makes sense with the ABV. I was expecting a more approachable beer just due to their pedigree, but at 10% I can understand why they don't make this so often, being so far outside of their usual IPA realm. It's not bad though, by all means. There's an additional note of toasted cracker in the medium-light body as the crisp carbonation finishes semi-dry with a hint of vanilla on the exhale.	4.04
1675	Ephraim	From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 05/08/19. Served in a tulip.. Pours a hazy, glowing honey-gold with maybe a finger of loose, bubbly suds. For such a scant head, retention is pretty exceptional and leaves a heavy cap of scummy froth. Concentric rings of lacing right to the bottom of the glass.. A fairly low-intensity nose of yeasty bread roll and sweet citrus..  1,066 characters	4.28
1676	Ephraim	Dark straw or light amber very cloudy appearance with significant white head that eventually disipates. Ate ma is a mild citrus. Taste is a nice grapefruit citrus.	4.46
1677	Ephraim	one of the best looking beers ive encountered. moderately hazy golden orange color with bright white head that leaves insane amounts of lacing, each sip is a ring on the glass. aroma and palate is grapefruit, grassy green herbaceous note, resinous pine, bready and sweet malts - honey and caramel predominate, some hints of orange and citrus peel. overall this was an enjoyable brew, cheers!	4.37
1678	Ephraim	"Fresh growler drank on 7/18/2017. L-kind of hazy, dark orange, light head
S-grassy/hay, some citrus, piney
T-citrus, piney, resinous, carmel. Pretty sweet
F-creamy with nice bitterness
O-a little disappointed as I've sought this out for a while. Pretty sweet but definitely a nice east coast double IPA. Pretty unique."	4.29
1679	Ephraim	This may be the best beverage I've ever tasted! Velvet on the tongue. Dank on the nose. Smooth down the gullet. Hoppy in all over the previous. LOVE IT!!	4.84
1680	Ephraim	"""Best consumed by 7/13/17""; drank 7/16/17 (I did my best).. Opaque orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a HUGE white head; frothy lace..  407 characters"	4.25
1681	Ephraim	First time trying Ephraim, poured from growler 1 day after being filled into tulip glass. Opaque hazy golden color, decent head, retention, and lacing. Tropical fruity nose and taste, and smooth full mouth feel. Easily in the same league as Abner, Susan, and SS 4&5. Outstanding!	4.78
1682	Ephraim	This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a semi-hazy almost burnt orange color with a thin wisp of a white head that quickly dissipated. Light bubbles of broken head float around the top. Light wispy lacing. The smell takes in sweet danky onion sliding on into through resinous pine and then a light grapefruit underneath. The taste had a full bittersweet flavor revolving around the resinous piney part. Dry resinous aftertaste leads into a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. ABV, whoah, where did that go? Its not really there, well hidden. Overall, wow, just wow, just an absolutely stellar job by HF. I’d love to have this again.	4.71
1683	Ephraim	This was malty for my tastes and for most HF hoppy beers. Felt more like a west cost IPA with the malt and pine characteristics. One of my least favorite HF hoppy beers.	4
1684	Ephraim	Very creamy IPA. Nice hops golden color, hoppy, piney and floral smells coming off one this one. Hazy orange color. Love the light creamy fluffy feel on this one.	4.76
1685	Ephraim	This one struck me as a little bitter at first, but I ended up really enjoying it as I went on. The combination of hops in this one works very well, making it another solid DIPA from HF.	4.52
1686	Ephraim	I don't generally love hoppy beers that are over 8.5% because they're too heavy and sweet, and this one is just those things. Hill beers have unrivaled mouthfeel and elegance, and this is just overdone. Intended I'm sure, given that it's 10%, but I'd take most of the Hill single and double IPAs over Ephraim.	4.12
1687	Ephraim	Poured from a 750 growler into a snifter. Thanks Rich for hooking me up with this.. Pours an amber slightly hazy body with a big frothy white head that reduces to leave heaving lacing and retention.. Aromas are floral, resinous, light citrus, dank, piney. Taste is very floral, herbal, grassy, finishes dry. Medium body with medium carbonation..  391 characters	4.03
1688	Ephraim	L: Clear amber, white head to a ring. It's fine, but not what I love.. S: Clean, grapefruit and some caramel malt. A bit of butter which is fine for the style.. T: Better here. Clean grapefruit citrus, ever so slight bubblegum. Light malt..  454 characters	4.36
1689	Ephraim	Sampled pour from a fresh 32 oz growler That indicated Amarillo hops were highlighted. Pours bRight, nearly lemon yellow and slightly hazy with a solid 2 fingers of dense head. Nose is lemongrass combined with grapefruit and a hint of bubblegum sweetness. The taste presented the sweet fruitiness apparent on the nose but was beautifully balanced by resinous hop bitterness. This is definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting.	4.85
1690	Ephraim	Expecting a bit more from this one. I expected the booziness given the 10% ABV but seem to be lacking in the aroma department. I enjoyed Abner earlier this week much more. Nonetheless, this is still a great beer. HF continues to produce high quality beers.	4.23
1691	Ephraim	Big, beefy DIPA with a huge ABV that drinks incredibly easy. Hoppy, piney and floral aroma; taste of orange rind, mandarin orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, tobacco and green tea. Outstanding citrus and bitter profile with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a balanced beer - it's a big time hop-forward DIPA that comes on strong and doesn't let up. With a 10% ABV I'm not sure what else you could expect. Prepare your face. They've employed magic to make such a huge beer so palatable.	4.28
1692	Ephraim	So. Damned. Creamy. The dextrose bumps up the body but doesn't make it syrupy. The appearance is pretty much perfect; bright auburn, perfect carbonation, sticky lacing. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate the taste and aroma. Maybe some tangelo and sweeter citrus. Though far from my favorite HF hoppy beer, it's ne of the best triple IPAs I've had. My heart still belongs to Notorious though.	4.42
1693	Ephraim	The beer comes in a pale amber, medium haze.. The aroma is dank, sweet orange peel, biscuity malt, marmalade sweetness, sticky resin, pine, dried herbs.. The beer continues with an underlying theme of dank resin, onto bitter pine and herbs on the finish. It is covered with biscuity sweetness up front, bitter grapefruit peel in marmalade..  554 characters	4.03
1694	Ephraim	Loved his brew! Waited forever to track it down but was able to sue to solid trading partners!!! :). Shared from a fresh 750 with friends. Excellent beer and tons of hops! Still pretty smooth but you can tell the abv is rather high	4.9
1695	Ephraim	The hallmark of HF beers is restraint, sophistication and a flawless execution. Ephraim is a bit peculiar by this standard. It is a bit too boozy, bitter and big. Distinctly lacking in those great tropical fruit/floral notes that the best HF hoppy beers have. I suspect another reason this is slightly disappointing is that the IPA game has consistently upped the bar since Ephraim stepped on the scene. Not a bad beer, but also not up to the considerable hype either.	4
1696	Ephraim	"Poured from a growler filled on 2/13/16 into a Hill Farmstead stem glass.. A: A translucent orange/light amber color with a white head that dissipates quickly.
S: Resinous and slightly citrusy aroma.
T: Resiny and almost sticky. Not a whole lot going on with this.
F: Smooth and drinkable.
O: Not really impressed with this. Maybe I should've had it fresher."	3.85
1697	Chemtrailmix	"Had this both fresh and ""aged"" for what it is worth, and I will say that the strength of the cinnamon itself does die down a little given time. But even with time, this is a cinnabomb, and as my favorite adjunct in a stout, take the rating with a little sense of bias. The cinnamon hides/tones down a bit of the sweetness of the overall brew, yet seems to be enhanced in flavor. A great addition to the BA DL family."	5
1698	Chemtrailmix	I've had the pleasure of enjoying Chemtrailmix three years in a row now - the bourbon barrel variant in 2017 stands out to me the most as it doesn't have the same bite and spice of rye (which I also happen to love). With a bit of age, the peppercorns mellow just slightly and the bourbon smoothly shines through. Back to back with barrel-aged Abraxas, this is still a tough one to beat. The cinnamon is far less present though, and those peppercorns have more of a bite.. Even more so in the rye variants.. Chemtrailmix is worth every bit of the praise and hype that it receives. It's a bit of an adjunct overload when fresh and hot, but it's a stunner with a little age. My love for this beer cannot be overstated.	4.7
1699	Chemtrailmix	Tasted from bottle. Pours black with minimal beige head. Lots of spices on aroma. Vanilla, cinnamon, bourbon. Taste is moderate to heavily sweet but not as much as regular dark lord. Nice cinnamon flavor and thankfully not a cinnamon bomb. Flavors of vanilla, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses and a hint of peppercorn on the finish. Awesome beer.	5
1700	Chemtrailmix	by far the best beer with cinnamon I've ever had. Very thick, this was Batch 1 that I had. It was really well balanced, cinnamon wasn't overpowering.	4.84
1701	Chemtrailmix	Had on tap at DLD. At a glance this looks like most other DL with a dark chocolate brown with a small head. The smell is dark chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch. When you take a sip the, the cinnamon plays perfectly with the dark chocolate and cocoa aspects of the Dark Lord. There is a slight heat and spice on the backend that lingers. Overall, this is one of the best variants of Dark Lord I've had in awhile and get why people hope to get this bottle!	4.95
1702	Chemtrailmix	Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.. Smell - Spicy cinnamon was very forward in the nose. Despite the high ABV, booze was not evident in the nose. Some roasty chocolate notes were also present.. Taste - As best I can describe it, the beer was liquid cinnamon Christmas trees. The cinnamon was so well balanced with the spice. It seems some brewers add cinnamon to extreme limits, and consequently destroying the beer. This was so well balanced. The peppercorn added a unique dimension that allowed for a pleasant burn at the end..  744 characters	5
1703	Chemtrailmix	11/17/18 (Chicago): 2 oz 15.0% ABV pour at 2018 FOBAB into taster glass. Dark brown pour, puffy tan head, leaves nice lacing, very good looking pour. Balanced aroma, chocolate the most prevalent with a hint of cinnamon. Malt has light roasted coffee aroma, rye whiskey well masked. Exciting bold taste, chocolate, cinnamon and very smooth rye whiskey worked great, very balanced offering. Nice creamy smooth mouth feel. This was a great offering, glad I had a chance to sample my first Dark Lord, this variant is an excellent offering and I look forward to trying future Dark Lord offerings.	4.38
1704	Chemtrailmix	"L: Dark mocha and chestnut hues with a rust-colored head and ample lacing
S: Fresh cinnamon rolls and a trace of light roast coffee
T: Mouthful of cinnamon toast crunch cereal up front that allows a slight spice and caramelized sugar to shine through
F: Medium bodied bordering on thick
O: One of the better BA treatments of Dark Lord that makes its own statement. The rye barrel aging paired well with the hint of peppercorn spice and was smoothed out by a mellow, but distinct cinnamon note."	4.74
1705	Chemtrailmix	One of the best beers of the year. This balances out perfectly the cinnamon and peppercorns with the barrel and the stout. A really really special beer that I’m very glad to have tried and have more of	4.75
1706	Chemtrailmix	Multiple pours via tap DLD. Pours pitch black with mocha colored head that dissipates quickly. Thick, sticky, stains the glass gold with a swirl. Nose is fantastic. Huge cinnamon (much bigger cinnamon presence than 2017), sweet brown sugar, spices, oak, vanilla, peppery notes. Taste is big cinnamon up front. Spiciness comes through, and sweetness on the back end. Chocolately. Feel is typical dark lord, viscous, thick, syrupy. Overall, incredible. Easily tops last year. Cinnamon toast with chocolate milk.	4.75
1707	Chemtrailmix	This glass of used motor oil on draft has brown staining legs in spades and a lesser mocha fizz than its un-spiced, un-aged younger brothers.. A shit ton of spicy cinnamon melds with wet brown sugar while raisin, black pepper and woody rye boldly accent. That peppercorn actually comes out more this time, contrasting all the powdery cinnamon, smoky charred oak, and sweet dark chocolate covered raspberry that this mother isn't shy to throw at you.. A bit of a sting runs through the smoothly slick, thickly round body that swallows semi-dry and heats the tummy..  1,298 characters	4.69
1708	Chemtrailmix	Had on tap at Dark Lord Day 18.. Pours thick black with a halo of brown bubbles. Nose is dark chocolate, cinnamon and spice. Taste is very sweet at first, and then balanced out by the spice and of the rye barrel working very well with the cinnamon and pepper. Feel is smooth with a very nice mouthcoat that keeps the flavors lingering. Great beer. The rye barrel with the spices really worked well for this.	4.55
1709	Chemtrailmix	Draft at DLD and on draft 2 days later at FFF.. Dark dark dark appearance. No foamhead except for caramel colored ring on the edge of glass. Cinnamon, bourbon, some chocolate and even a slight bit of jamminess. Taste follows the nose. Good bit of cinnamon but not overpowering other ingredients. Chocolate is present and some jam quality too. GOOD bourbon note and a very sticky thick mouthfeel.. As someone who’s had the past four Marshmallow Handjees and many other DL variants, this just may be the best one: Chemtrailmix 2018. Also, this dwarfs BA Abraxas 17 I had and makes the BA Abraxas taste one dimensional and lacking in barrel presence. Top 5 beers I’ve had all time... easily.	4.99
1710	Chemtrailmix	I had FIVE of the variants on DLD and this was by far the best. The taste is a mild cinnamon toast crunch with a great balance of the peppercorns. This is a world class stout, very silky. If you can get it, get it.	4.94
1711	Chemtrailmix	This beer was amazing. I sampled 6 of the Dark Lord variants including Marshmallow Handjee and French Vanilla Malitia. It was the best by far. Personally it stole the show at Dark Lord Day. It was even better than the 2017 version.	4.96
1712	Chemtrailmix	First beer I had at Dark Lord Day 2018. Sampled multiple times throughout the course of the day as well. On draft and poured into plastic cups, which were then poured into my glass. Standard Dark Lord body, not much to be said about that. Smell is a massive cinnamon, slight spicy rye, brown sugar, a bit of burnt black coffee, a bit of umami, milk chocolate- recognizably Dark Lord underneath. The flavour is a bit more muddled, but the cinnamon remains huge, from the beginning to the end, contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the DL base, and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend. Peppercorns aren't as prominent as in 2017, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, good carbonation, smooth and slightly silky, cinnamon spice on the finish. This is on the level of BA Abraxas in terms of the cinnamon, without the green pepper from the spices. I can see this one being the variant of the year.	4.61
1713	Chemtrailmix	absolutely phenomenal, surprisingly great balance of rye barrel notes with cinnamon and the pick peppercorn worked well into the mix. Rich and full. Outstanding indeed.	4.94
1714	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	16 ounce cans at share. I hit the Trillium trifecta tonight, getting to try three of their double dry hopped ales. The Fort point was no exception. Very well-crafted, citrusy, fruity, with a nice lingering bitterness that seems to go on forever. Juicy and silky smooth.	4.26
1715	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Dated 6/19/19 on the bottom of the can, 6 weeks since brewing.. Pours an extremely hazy, nearly opaque pale yellow with a finger of fluffy head. Nose bursting with candied peach, pineapple, mango, resin, fresh herbaceousness, lychee, Portuguese breadiness, hint of bubblegum, slight mushroomy earthiness and a little belgian spice. Taste is fresh tropical fruit for days, lingering around your tastebuds for quite a while, wonderful. Low carbonation, soft medium- body but slightly watery. Low bittering/drying. Probably the best pale I've ever had, both bursting with flavor and deeply refreshing. Could CRUSH a 4 pack of these in a heartbeat.	4.56
1716	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Nose is pineapples, candied tangerine, pine. Taste follows with pithy tangerine with some pineapple and then finishes like biting into a juicy tangerine. If you let it linger more there is creamy mango and melon left. The feel is pillowy with solid carb. Overall a really pleasant pale ale.	4.75
1717	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"On draft in canton.. Completely hazy, light, pineapple juice color.
The nose brings sharp, sweet citrus.
Taste comes in with tropical/citrus notes and a nice bitter background.. Bitterness in there while still keeping it on the soft side."	4.27
1718	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Pours a murky yellow color. Tons of citrus hops and tropical fruits, medium body and no bitterness at all. Very easy to drink.. Overall a very good pale ale; not as hoppy as their DDH IPA’s but very good.	4.33
1719	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Probably the best DDH NEIPA I have tried to date, and although I may not have tried everything under the sun that still includes quite a bit of the best!! So incredibly well-balanced, amazing smell and perfect feel and finish. Bought in Boston and drank fresh.	4.96
1720	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	finally got my lips on this one, an extra hopped version of their now famous pale ale, and its predictably awesome. the thing about this, and about so many of the dry hoppy trillium beers really, is that they seem to know when to stop, and in some ways, i like this as much for what it isnt as i do for what it is. its not green and vegetal and forced, over saturated, harsh, or bitey, and that alone makes it better than so many others out there in this style right now. soft yellow even light greenish in color, its muted looking, thin, and nicely bubbly. it smells awesome, citra all over this, but not modern day citra, like citra when it first came into vogue and nobody could get enough of it, so distinctive and fresh, lemony and lemongrassy, with a beautiful freshness to it that almost is as relevant as the aroma it contributes. light green tea, a softly starchy but dry grain base, and a level of refinement evident that i am not used to in these. the flavor is as good as the nose, pineapple and honeydew and lemon zest all come to mind, but this isnt intense for all the dry hops it has, they seem so well integrated, not just on the surface but fundamental to what this is, and that is rare. light bitterness at the end but enough for this to appear balanced. awesome carbonation makes it feel really light, and the grain base is dry and simple but rustic enough to contribute something, and i really like that with the juicy hops in here. a really worthy beer, highly acclaimed and for good reason.	4.44
1721	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Truly excellent well balanced and smooth double dry hopped pale ale. Salad hands of Citra with fruit flavors as well. Great aroma. Extremely well balanced beer and drink at 6.6%.	4.73
1722	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	I'm a huge fan of Trillium's higher gravity DIPAs and wasn't sure what to expect with a Pale Ale DDH, but I am very impressed. Great nose and look, very juicy in flavor and scent. The mouth feel is very light compared to their larger ABV offerings, but it bursts with flavor through to the end of the glass. A great beer at an attractive price point!	4.74
1723	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Picked-up a four-pack of cans at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty dollars. Very solid brew, one of my favorite from these guys, would buy again.	4.5
1724	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	05/2015 - An absolutely incredible, juicy, fruity, dank, spritzy, delicious Fort Point variation. It's a bit danker, bolder, yet juicier version of its younger brother.	4.63
1725	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Appearance - From thecan, the beer poured a cloudy orange color with a white head.. Smell - The nose smell of fresh oranges.. Taste - My first impression is tart orange with pulp. Light pine and tea qualities are present with the thick backbone. There is very little bitterness..  414 characters	4.47
1726	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Even though I had to fly to Boston, and drive to Canton - DDH Fort Point was well worth it.. It's funny because I really, really enjoy the base beer - Fort Point - and had badly wanted DDH Fort Point for some time... but when I planned my trip to Boston, I didn't think about that one particular beer at all. I'd hoped that Tree House might have a special release or something, but didn't give Trillium a second though. Lo and behold, I ended up getting bottles and cans of several Permutations - and finally had the joy of DDH Fort Point on tap.. The beer pours beautiful, a nice yellow-gold with a clean white head. It smells richly of citrus. I couldn't believe how free of bitterness it was - just a bit of light dryness, and tons of juice. I've occasionally scoffed at DDH beers that just don't seem any better than the base... this is not one of those beers. DDH Fort Point was absolutely worth the wait. My only lament is that it was not available in cans!	4.75
1727	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	From a can dated 4/26/18, poured into a glass at home.. Looks like muddy apricot, virtually opaque. Modest head, some lacing.. The smell was the high point for me -- so much hops, I felt like I was standing in a brewery..  394 characters	4.26
1728	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	CANNED ON 04/26/18. Pours a rather murky orange color with a loose foamy head that clumps around the edges. Bold fruity hop aromas like pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, and stone fruit layered with spicy herbs, wood, and pine resin. Hoppy fresh flavor: green herbs, pink grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and a bit of a raw hop attack on the back end. Smooth, medium body with frothy carbonation and a nice crispness. The sheer lupulin blast (and ABV) cuts down on the refreshment factor - quality stuff though.	4.24
1729	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Love the super dry finish on this. Hazy, with a chance of juicy, a low amount of bitterness with a super dry finish makes me a happy Trillium drinker.	4.79
1730	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	World-class indeed! Beautiful complexity, a flavor dance both juicy and bitter. Gorgeous hazy look in the glass, a grapefruit smell the second you pop the top. An eye-closer on every sip.	4.54
1731	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Smell: This is an attack of Pineapple right away. Pineapple juice, fresh pineapple. After all the pineapple more tropical fruit comes along. It is reminiscent of a tropical stone fruit cocktail. Mango, papaya, peach, pear. It’s has like a liquified sugary syrup note that really helps hammer home that canned fruit cocktail thing. A touch of really sweet juicy mandarin oranges. Also a really bright note of zesty grapefruit and white bread crust. The beer smells ridiculously good!. Taste: The beer follows the nose with a tidal wave of pineapple just bombarding my taste buds. There is also some mango, peach, and pear that follows behind all that pineapple. The tropical and stone fruit notes transition into the mid palette. This liquified sugar and honey sweetness shows up and helps bring back that fruit cocktail thing that was picked up on the nose. There is also a really faint note of white bread crust. As the beer moves into the finish it let’s you know it is a beer. More grapefruit zest and orange peel come through then the nose leads on and adds a noticeable bitterness. Also there is a good amount of grassiness and some of that hop burn that is present sometimes in Trillium beers. That hop burn lingers a bit in the aftertaste and takes away from this beer some. But overall this taste really good.. Feel: Medium bodied. With a light to moderate amount of creaminess. The beer is crisp on the tongue as well. Also this has a really long finish with all the flavors the beer has to offer just lingering on the tongue. The long finish takes away from the drink ability a little bit, but that’s not something that really matters..  1,966 characters	4.43
1732	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	A - Pours a turbid orange with a one finger fizzy white head. Nice amount of soay lacing.. S - Aroma is orange, pineapple and mango.. T - The taste is orange, mango, pineapple, apricot and some light resinous hops..  421 characters	4.52
1733	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	This is so well balanced, and very drinkable. Not as much of a novelty as a lot of the ddh juice bombs. Balanced citrus, spicy and lightly malty. Amazingly refreshing!!	4.56
1734	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	On draft at Trillium Canton.. Orange juice, hazy golden orange goodness. Quarter inch of foamy head that sits on top. Not too much residual lace.. Sweet, tropical. Citrus, mango, wonderful..  350 characters	4.56
1735	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	A; hazy pale orange amber color with a thin vibrant white head. S: creamsicle, sweet orange, mango, apricot and sweet fluffy malt. T: just like the nose. Sweet citrus, a touch of grapefruit, mango, apricot and pineapple. Creamsicle and more sweet blood orange. Finish has a touch of flat sweetness and earthy hops.  491 characters	4.34
1736	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	I don’t often rate beers, actually I never rate beers, but I felt I had to for this beer. I love everything about it. Taste, smell, look and even the price isn’t bad (so long as you get it from their brewery and not a second hand liquor store on the west coast). I’ve had a lot of beers in my 8 years of craft drinking and this ranks near the top of not the very top of my list of all time beers. If my sisters didn’t already live in Boston I’d consider flying back east just for this beer.	5
1737	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.. 16 oz. Can
Canned On: 11/13/17. Poured into a Trillium glass a very nice cloudy yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger plus white head, which also leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a pretty nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, mango, pineapple), nice little diesel like. The taste is pretty nice, hoppy, malty, with a pretty nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, mango, pineapple), nice little diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden pretty well, with a pretty nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty tasty brew. Addictive! Orange Julius! Glad to have gotten a chance to try it. Thanks Bill!"	4.71
1738	Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Hazy Orange color at the pour, with a large head that is fairly thin. Smell is amazing - you could smell this beer across the room at open. Taste is pineapple with a nice hop bite at the end. Creamy body that fits the beer nicely. I'd say it's my favorite APA I've except for maybe DDH PseudoSue, though at 6.6% this is an APA in name only.	4.69
1739	Nectarine Premiere	Bottle at share. Hazy, milky pour, pale golden , relatively flat. Big stone fruit aroma, light tartness. Bright, sharp nectarine flavors, tartness is instant, but levels off. Excellent.	4.4
1740	Nectarine Premiere	"My first De Garde taste. WOW! best brew i think i ever had.
This is what i use to scale many of my beer ratings and is what i look for in a beer.. Only had it on tap"	5
1741	Nectarine Premiere	Poured out as a slightly hazed orange color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is packed with funky nectarine sourness which is to be expected from de Garde. The flavors are similar to the nosem lots of acidic funky nectarine coming in full speed from start to finish. The feel is light to medium bodied and dry. Overall it's a kick ass sour. So it's worthy seeking out if you're into that sort of thing.	4.25
1742	Nectarine Premiere	04/2016 - as it warms, the fruit, funk, and oak ripen and delight the senses; the nectarine is lovely, but doesn't overwhelm the senses; digging the mouthfeel of this; traditional dG acidity in the back of the palate; juicy, sour, funky finish.	4.62
1743	Nectarine Premiere	A: Pours a light straw color, soda-like fizz, with almost no head.. S: A big, earthy/horseblanket brett, pie-like sugary lemon, nectarine, peach, and a little lactic tartness. The brett is fairly dominant.. T: Nice mix of white wine, nectarine, peach, a bit of lemon, moderate earthy funk (toned down a bit from the nose), with medium-light tartness. The wine is prominent and adds a sweet roundness which cuts the tart and adds a really nice dimension. Shortish finish..  761 characters	4.63
1744	Nectarine Premiere	Poured from a 750mL bottle into a oversized wine glass. Thank you Ryan for sharing this!. Pours a sunshine golden hazy body, this is literally glowing. Small white head. Beautiful beer. God damn that is thick on the last pour. Oh my god, straight fruit purée.. On the nose.. straight stone fruit, pulp to the nasal, like someone just crushed a bunch of nectarines and peaches and the aromas are wafting in my general direction..  647 characters	4.81
1745	Nectarine Premiere	I had b2 last year and knew I had to get my hands on more. B3 isn't quite as fruity or have the same mouthfeel but nevertheless it's very similar. Best nose on any sour period. Many people comment how you can smell chocolate or coffee or other things and I've always thought that these were more resembling characteristics but this beer really does smell like straight nectarines and nothing else. Beautiful citrus. The level of sour and acidity are damn near perfect. I've had quite a few DeGarde beers and this is hands down my favorite right with Imperial Stone Bu. When I traded for the B2 with the Peach I thought the Peach was a total let down compared to this gem. Totally worth trying at least once.	4.81
1746	Nectarine Premiere	"Had this on draft on site at De Garde.
L: Orange, like a hazy NE style IPA, maybe even a bit more orange. Head was about a finger width and stayed around for a while.
S: Like orange, apricot, and of course nectarines.
T: Sweet Nectar of the Gods. I mean sweet fruit and some cotton candy.
F: Nice and full.
O: Best ""sour"" I've had. I don't know if I could enjoy a beer more."	5
1747	Nectarine Premiere	Pours a hazy yellow color with only a few fuzzy bubbles on the surface. Aroma is fresh, unripened nectarines, grapefruit pearl, lemon, and fresh oak, and some granny smith apple. Taste is like biting into a fresh nectarine that is more tart than juicy. There's a little acetic acid and band aid as is common with De Garde. It has a full flavor while maintaining a light airy freshness throughout. I get a rich, white wine note as it warms along with grapefruit pith and sour lemon candy. Carbonation is minimal but just enough to move the beer along. It's very esay to drink the 750 in one sitting. This is a fantastic beer.	4.56
1748	Nectarine Premiere	Bottle on-site at de Garde. The aroma and flavor of this beer are incredible, but it had very low carbonation. Not sure if it was just the bottle I had or if that is typical. Either way, it is a great fruited wild ale.	4.45
1749	Nectarine Premiere	I don't see how a wild can get any better than this! Pour is nectarine orange and opaque, with a fizzy short lasting head, but a bountiful ring of nectarine pulp decorating the rim of the glass all the way around that's there to stay. Nose is definately nectarine with some peach and star fruit, and taste is all nectarine. Mouthfeel is softly carbonately and tart on the finish. This thing is so good. Nice job de Garde!	4.69
1750	Nectarine Premiere	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, red session. Really hazy, milky, bright vanilla color. Aroma has bright apricot and peach notes. Taste is tart an fruity with yogurt notes and dry on the finish.	4.6
1751	Nectarine Premiere	2016 vintage, poured into a taster. Huge stone fruit, as expected, well balanced with the wine barrel notes and typical dG funk. Very nicely done overall.	4.67
1752	Nectarine Premiere	Look- Nice orange color, my guess would be it was a nectarine sour just from looking at it poured in a glass.. Smell- This was the best part, the nose on this is perfect, super funk nectarine, almost smells like its going to sweet when you taste it.. Taste- Sour nectarine with that classic de garde funk.  367 characters	4.79
1753	Nectarine Premiere	"Had a week ago.
Look was a hazy golden orange juice. Very nice!
Aroma was fantastic! Strong true nectarine and that distinctive barnyard hay/grassy DG funk. Surprising bubble gum aroma in the background.
Taste is thankfully similar to the aroma. Nectarine and funk really shine here! Aftertaste is same, and it lingers.
Mouthburst was good but not overwhelming, and carbonation not too strong.
Overall, it certainly impressed me. Among the top 5 sours I have had! Worth the effort in getting!"	5
1754	Nectarine Premiere	Really gorgeous beer here - and the oak wine barrels give it a nice complexity. I really wasn't even sure what a nectarine was, but I definitely know now!	4.37
1755	Nectarine Premiere	Appearance - nice white foam head that lingers, cloudy orange color that looks like OJ, Aroma has tons of citrus notes - the nectarine is immediately noticeable, slight funk notes as it warms - Taste is out of this world good - so much citrus juice-like acidity that compliments the lactic acid and makes this beer next level good. Body is full and balanced, sour with the citric & lactic acid but they pair so well together in this beer especially with the sweetness of the nectarine. Overall this beer has so much character and amazingly well made.	4.74
1756	Nectarine Premiere	Opaque yellow with a large eggshell blanket.. Smell is very strong apple and fresh nectarine. Peach overload!. Taste is, very simply, exceptionally smooth, soft, fresh peach. Skin and all..  440 characters	4.82
1757	Nectarine Premiere	drank on 10/27/2016. latest batch. Golden/yellowish, bright, nice head, beautiful. Citrus, funky, oak, fruity.  285 characters	4.71
1758	Nectarine Premiere	Pours fizzy apricot and cloudy. Smell and taste are all big citrus zest, tart apricot, some pulpy orange and blood orange. Feel is a bit fizzy, but works with the zest. Tasty, palate cleansing. Great beer	4.37
1759	Nectarine Premiere	Golden orange. Looks like orange juice. White head.. Nose is amazing. Straight nectarine.. Taste is nectarine and sourness. Tart with some lemon citrus. Extremely fruity..  223 characters	4.61
1760	Nectarine Premiere	I think this is a little over hyped, but is still very solid. The most outstanding factor is the deep nectarine juicy-ness of the beer. I mean it has the essence of jammy. But the flavor is pretty one dimensional after that, tart, clean, smooth, decent body,	4.36
1761	Nectarine Premiere	Pours a yellow and hazy color with small yellow head. Smells of peach and nectarine funkiness predominate. Nice acidic nectarine sour which is incredibly balanced. Loved this beer	4.83
1762	Nectarine Premiere	Glad I tracked this one down! This little DG fruit bomb is loaded with Nectarine goodness and just the right amount of delightful tartness! Beautiful orange pour and refreshing as hell!	4.88
1763	Nectarine Premiere	Incredible pour, super hazy absolutely no transparency. bright yellow and shiny, just beautiful. The nose on this thing is stupid, my mouth gleeks with anticipation, so much juicy fruit, Nectarines are pouring out, super ripe. The blind taste test I gave to some friends had them all guessing the stone fruits immediately. The taste is nothing short of amazing, this has to be one of my very favorite from de Garde and maybe one of my all time favorite Farmhouse Ales- it's been a long time since a beer blew my expectations but this is a special bottle. I've got 2 more of these bad boys and was thinking of trading them but I might not be able to after this.	4.8
1764	Triple Sunshine	"Picked up a 6 pack of these before we left the source. Basically drank everything they had on draft but this, seeing as how I was gonna grab a pack on the way out. Drank the first one at Trekkie's wedding.. Pours a familiar beer color yellow-light orange with 1/3"" white head that dissolves at a predictably average rate. Aroma seemed to go with Galaxy and Citra hops? Notes of pine and pineapple were abundant alongside a mild sweet citrus component.. Taste and mouth feel are where its at. Has a similar to Pliny like texture of corn syrup for drying effect and hop avalanche on top of a relatively easy going malt bill. Keeps the grapefruit, orange and pineapple feels flowing the entire time. Real easy to drink, hides alcohol especially well. The pine seems to be from the boil, the CTZ (they call 'em Columbus for some reason in the more liberal parts it seems, odd) pushes through the entire drinking experience..  1,082 characters"	4.23
1765	Triple Sunshine	Triple Sunshine pours a murky, dark orange with a vibrant and healthy 1-finger head with spotty lacing. The smell hits with a big hop aroma including pineapple and grapefruit and a grassy note. Taste is a bit hot up front with pithy fruit and some citrus and floral notes late.	4.13
1766	Triple Sunshine	Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. There’s a hazy complexion. There’s light soapy lacing. The aroma is of citrus with a bit of pine. I’m tasting a wallop of citrus with abut of pine. The mouth is sticky and resinous.	4.35
1767	Triple Sunshine	"L - A glowing pool of oils, golden hops, and more hops. Almost looks greasy on top. Great lacing, per the ABV.
S - Fantastic aromas, floral, wondering where I am as I wander through fields of hops...
T - Where this falls a little short - almost too smooth - like a Waldo's but without much 'bite' on it. Certainly leans on the imperial of the IPA side of triples. No harm no foul, just not my fave.
F - Great carbonation, very smooth, almost delicate.
O - Great stuff from Lawson's but I'll take their IPA/DIPAs over this one."	4.21
1768	Triple Sunshine	12 oz can canned 9/9/19 poured into a tulip glass, a golden hazy orange with half finger white head. Aroma is all pine,grapefruit, and maybe some cantaloupe? The taste is very balanced between some malt/sugar notes and the hop citrus flavor profile. The alcohol is barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, carbonation level is medium low. A pretty tasty balanced triple.	4.46
1769	Triple Sunshine	"Canned on: 08/09/19, picked up at the new brewery.
What an epic beer. Seems easy to make a heavily-hopped IPA but it doesn’t seem easy to make a TIPA (TRIPA?) because it’s so massive. I’ve seen a few other Triple IPAs and this tops ‘em all. Hazy, proper head, beautiful color. Plenty of booze in the nose but it’s inviting, sweet, and rather malty. The aroma carries over to the flavor, but the masterful hop bill really shows throughout, especially in the feel and finish. Sooooo smooth, perfectly sweet yet hoppy, and the right body. Balance makes this a stellar beer but a world-class IPA (cubed). And a 4-pack for $15 at the brewery is a damn steal!"	4.77
1770	Triple Sunshine	12 oz can: This one pours a hazy darker orangish golden color. A wisp of a white head and almost no lacing. Good nose. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical hop notes. The taste is very good. Somewhat bitter with an underlying thicker sweetness. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical flavors. Maybe some honey and biscuit also. Very nice.	4.43
1771	Triple Sunshine	Probably the best/smoothest of the triple IPAs that I’ve had. With that said, the style itself is a bit over the top for my preference. The booze overpowers everything else. Some flavors of overripe peaches and white grapefruit but the booze washes over everything and lingers. Some residual sweetness with the boozy aftertaste. Overall probably the top of the class for this style but the style isn’t my preference.	3.85
1772	Triple Sunshine	LAWSONS TRIPLE SUNSHINE TIPA 5/30/19. Acquired at the brewery 5/26/19 but canned 4/17.. Poured from the 12 oz. can into an Alchemist stemmed tulip..  815 characters	4.74
1773	Triple Sunshine	Canned 3/27/19. Pours a mild golden hue with a thin head into my glass. Strong hop punch in the nose with pineapple and grapefruit. Extremely bitter with grapefruit, pineapple and lychee making their presence known in the mouth. Acidic finish that reminds one to sip, not quaff. At 10.3%, it's stronger than most IPAs and if you like your IPAs on the lower side of the spectrum, you may not enjoy this. I do though. Well worth it.	3.96
1774	Triple Sunshine	"canned 02/19/19. L- The beer pours a hazy golden with about a 1 cm white head. The head recedes fairly quickly into a thin film leaving spotty lacing.
S-The nose is primarily a mix of pineapple and weedy dankness.
T- Up front there is some good bitterness of the grapefruit pithy variety. As your palate adjusts to the bitterness, the sweetness really comes on. It is juicy sweet pineapple which lingers long after the bitterness relents. Alcohol is well hidden.
F- The mouthfeel is medium overall, but has a real syrupy quality which is enhanced by the sweetness of the beer. Carbonation is light, but still keeps the beer from getting to heavy.
O- A well executed triple. The sweetness will keep some people from enjoying it, but it's certainly in line with other examples that I've had. Recommended for fans of Triple IPA's."	4.24
1775	Triple Sunshine	"Consumed 3/19/19. A: Deep golden orange, some notes of copper at the core - surprisingly clear - pours with a small, off-white head, fades to a wispy cap, retains a small collar, leaves some spots of lacing. S: Something like a fruity mixed drink - bright citrus, with some orange and grapefruit juice, and some some syrupy citrus, like orange marmalade - floral citrus - herbal notes, with some leafy hops and some pine resin - lots of fruit, fruit cocktail - pineapple, mango (including the weird aspect of mango that my brain finds vaguely cheesy), peach, apricot -
rich malt base, with some pale grains, caramel malt, and booze (hard to hide at 10+ABV).  1,768 characters"	4.16
1776	Triple Sunshine	Brother in law traversing Vermont happened upon Lawson Finest ( I gave him a hint). He rewarded me with triple sunshine. Can poured into tuilip glass. Two finger off white foam cap, very good rentention, settles to apencil thin layer after five minutes.  525 characters	4.24
1777	Triple Sunshine	This beer is amazingly good..It poured unassumingly into my goblet. And I smelled the fragrant moistness of a hop plant, and I could feel it growing, into the sun, for me to have come in contact with my taste receptors on my tongue, which then shot the image into my brain...I even felt the warmth of the sun's rays onto the hop plant that I had seen come on a journey through the loving brewing processes of Lawson's Liquids, making with humble and tender care to get these impressions upon my tongue, which can talk but not hear, and my eyes, which can see but don't know how the see, to the mind's eye, seeing the journey of the hops into the fingers that type this review. I have to say...this beer really took me on a journey on what it means to be a hop plant, a miracle of the bosom of this earth, which loves all of it's subjective observers, whom we are but a small portion of. You try that with any other beer and you're going to have much more difficult time. This beer is what it means to be a hop...this is WHY hops are what they are!	4.83
1778	Triple Sunshine	Ironically, it's Lawson's that is helping me to appreciate some of the new kids in the Triple IPA marketplace - specifically in reference to The Veil and Aslin.. What I really value about Triple Sunshine is that it's not a huge malt bomb, like many of the newer options out there - it's pleasantly hazy, sweet, and exhibits a ton of pineapple character. It's not quite syrupy, but definitely has lots of thick, yeasty body. It still manages to finish just the tiniest bit dry and clean. Again - that sweet pineapple is terrific.. Friends had told me I wouldn't like Triple Sunshine, and that I shouldn't bother after regular and Double Sunshine - I guess I don't see the criticisms. It's definitely an OG, but it continues to hold its own. Really enjoyed this one.	4.53
1779	Triple Sunshine	Canned 2/10/19. A: Pours a hazy orange. Tall, effervescent nearly-white head. Decent lacing and quite good head retention.. S:.  708 characters	4.15
1780	Triple Sunshine	Picked up a four pack at Lwason’s The other weekend. Pours a hazy orange with little head. Smells of strong pine & citrus. Tastes awesome....sticky and dank pineapple with plenty of citrus hops. Alcohol is there but we’ll in balance. A great nightcap beer. Glad to have tried this.	4.56
1781	Triple Sunshine	A - Hazy golden tan color with light creamy foam on top.. S - Tropocal fruit aroma with some tropical fruit. Not as aromatic as Double Sunshine.. T - Boozy. Resiny pine from start to finish with a lingering bitter citrus and pine finish. Resiny citrus..  372 characters	4.13
1782	Triple Sunshine	Finally got the opportunity to have Triple Sunshine. The wait was long and the hype was probably more than it needed to be but here's my review. It pours as a golden yellow with a subtle hazy but mostly a clearer beer to say the least. The smell of the beer has a very pleasant hop aroma to it. The taste pretty well balanced between the hops and malt, reminding me of some of the original west coast IPA's that used to rule the beer world. The feel of this is actually a bit thinner than I expected, I suppose this was due to the increase in alcohol compared to how Double Sunshine feels. Overall this is definitely a great beer, I still prefer the Double Sunshine over this and Sip of Sunshine but this was still a treat and very glad to have tried it.	4.43
1783	Triple Sunshine	Fantastic IPA. Like the line of Sunshine beers from Lawson's, hop tastes range from citrus to something else. In the case of this triple hopped brew, lychee. Would really like to accurately know the hop profile, but Lawson's keeps those details close to the vest. The only downside to Triple Sunshine was that at the very end, a bit of booziness crept in. Still, a classic.	4.08
1784	Triple Sunshine	Prom night, your wedding night, the first time you played hide the salami with your significant other... what I am trying to get at, is that like these instances, there is a lot of expectation put upon this beer. So, did Triple Sunshine score from half court like Raul did on prom night? Kind of. I’m thinking more like it banked in, but I didn’t call my shot. The nose on thing thing is just dastardly and robust - think Karl Malden. I mean for real, this beer smells more ripe than Bar Rafieli’s pompoms. Appearance is all kinds of sexy like Isla Fisher in a pair of Jimmy Choo stilleto’s - yeah, I like dat. Now, this is when things get unbalanced, or just unfair; taste is good, I’m feeling it. But am I feeling it like Ariana Grande screamin’ “Breathin”? Close, but no cigar. Problem is that this beer was canned on 11/09/18; and according to Raul’s finger counting mathametics, that was a long time ago. Not like, hella long, but long enough that things probably have toned down a bit. When your boy drinks it, I get a tidal wave of Tahitian fruits, but unfortunately that wave of gloriousness dies quickly without much bite. And if you don’t know, bitinng can be gooda good thing. Roar.. I’d love to try it fresh, and I’m still content, but how many licks it takes to get to the center of the Tootsie, Raul may never know.	4.09
1785	Triple Sunshine	Can. White head. Golden orange color.. Juicy with a melon and dank weedy flavor. Dandelion flavor. Orange and papaya. Hoppy, bitter, a bit of abv shows. Solid triple.	4.25
1786	Triple Sunshine	"Pours a hazy murky golden color. The head is white, 2 finger, very frothy, with amazing retention. Some lacing as the head dissipates.
The nose is really full on citrus. Mango, grapefruit, some pineapple, orange.
Taste - This is one hell of a juice bomb. Just insane amount of juice in this beer. The above flavors are all in the taste, and they mingle so well together.
Creamy feel. The hops linger with a pleasing citrus after taste in my throat. Thick bodied.
Totally solid IPA. I can see why there's a lot of love for it."	4.6
1787	Triple Sunshine	Good. However, my favorite is still Sip of Sunshine, followed by Double Sunshine, and then this one. I'll explain why. Here goes:. A: Alright. Head is not nearly as big as it is in Sip and Double, but it's still alright. It fades rather quickly, however, leaving no lacing. The body is a very cloudy, dark orange.. S: Very fruity and floral. A TON of grapefruit, complemented by pineapple, lemon, and floral/herbal scents. Also a hint of pine. Very good..  849 characters	4.14
1788	Triple Sunshine	Golden beer with an orange tint. The finger of white head fades and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Tropical fruit and floral notes emanate from the glass. There is pineapple and orange mixed with some herbal notes. Sweet beer with orange and and caramel. There are floral flavors and a nice bitter finish. Quite a tasty beer.	4.59
1789	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Lots of good things happening here, my only issue was that this beer is that I thought the chili peppers were a bit over powering. I'm not a huge fan of chilis in beer to begin with, but I've had a few that balanced it well...this one over did it. On the plus side though, you do get lots of vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, and a nice medium to full body.. Bottle#068
Bottled on 11/24/17"	4.5
1790	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This had wonderful pepper, bourbon, dark chocolate, some tobacco up front; nice spice immediately on the palate, plus plum, cacao; great body, with spice, bourbon lingering!	4.5
1791	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Old check in. Tasted on draft. Pours black. Aroma of bourbon, coffee, caramel, cocoa. Thick and chewy, oily mouthfeel. Lots of coffee, cocoa, molasses, bourbon, caramel. Very smooth with no alcohol burn. Incredible.	5
1792	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Look: very cola like with a khaki head that dies fast
Smell: maple syrup dominated with vanilla and a finish of chilli peppers and bourbon.
Taste: big chilli front fallowed by an amazing blend of vanilla and chocolate with chilli... finished with a maple syrup bourbon.
Feel: a nice chili burn, medium carbonation, medium light body and really easy to drink.. Overall this is better than double barrel huna... perfectly blended"	4.7
1793	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Motor oil black with brown edges and nary a wisp of head to speak of.. GNVP has a fruity ghost pepper sting in both the nose and taste, with a thin feel that does not bring a lot of barrel or other expected flavors, but some dark chocolate and dark fruit notes do come forward. A hot pepper sting scratches the throat after the swallow, much like Mexican Cake, buffered by a thick carbonation and cut off by a dry, chewy finish.. This is okay, but...I feel like I've been raped at this point, and not by the heat, but by the overwhelming hype people pumped this beer up to beer, only for it to be less enjoyable than numerous annual shelfies I can think of right off the top of my head.	3.52
1794	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Batch 3 poured into a tulip. Dark in color, slightly transparent in the pour. Small mocha head that dissipates quick. Nose is all cinnamon and spice. Flavor is very much like the nose. Cinnamon is prevalent with hints of cocoa and some pepper spice to finish. Really tasty. Fee is where this fell short. On the thin side. Wanted this to be more full bodied and mouth coating. Overall, great beer. Just wish it was thicker.	4.54
1795	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Reviewed the batch aged in 4 Roses
L: Pours a lustrous dark brown with a thin sandy head
S: Gorgeous nose - picking up a bit of barrel, cacao nibs, and cinnamon
T: Follows the nose but picked up a bit of maple and vanilla sweetness - nicely done
F: A touch thin, but moderately viscous with ample carb
O: The flavor profile of this beer is spot on with a nice touch of maple, heat, and sweetness. The only downfall of this beer was the mouthfeel for me - just a bit on the thinner side for a big BA stout. Otherwise very enjoyable."	4.63
1796	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"L: pours see through black, with a film of head
S: mild aroma with the cinnamon most notably.
T: starts with chocolate and cinnamon then the peppers and cinnamon dominate through the finish. Overall this is slightly bitter and missing the rich fudge notes
F: this is thinner than I expected with the chilies warm my throat a lips"	4.38
1797	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	What a score for my 1000th review. I was at 999 yesterday and debating what to drink for my big review. Well it just happens I got off work and voodoo announced this release 10 minutes later. Hauled ass 1.5 hrs north to Meadville and scored it and some bottles.. L - Draft pour. Dark black minimal head. Very thick lacing.. S - Sweet mollasses, toffee, cinnamon,.  636 characters	4.53
1798	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Batch 2. From bottle into snifter.. Pours pitch black with almost no foam at all upon pour. No foam present during the drinking. A lot of things going on here. Initially getting a lot of 'fudgy' aromas: cocoa nibs, vanilla, brownie. Taste definitely follows the nose but adds the right amount of pepper, spice kick at the end. As it warmed, the cinnamon came out to play but not in an overwhelming fashion. The bourbon note though is really present! Loved that about this beer. Mouthfeel was medium-thick.. This beer is deserving of its rating and Voodoo has yet again nailed another monster BA imperial stout.	4.85
1799	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This was AMAZING! tons of chocolate and bourbon barrel notes here! Sad that I traded off my earlier AB version before trying it....as this one was other-worldly!!! Hope to track this down again at some point!	5
1800	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	On tap. Black color, no head. Aroma has sweet, spicy chocolate, peppers and coconut. Taste has peppers with medium to high chili heat, cinnamon and some bourbon in the background. Medium body and carbonation.	4.65
1801	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	22oz bomber from batch#2 poured into a Spoonwood Brewing snifter:. Look: Pours a jet black color with about an 1/2 inch of head. Minor lacing present with little to no retention. Love the jet black color on this!. Smell: Strong notes of maple right off the bat followed by some bourbon and vanilla! Aroma is amazing!.  916 characters	5
1802	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Batch 2 drank in a snifter on 12/21/2016. Look-dark chocolate milk, a little lacing and nice tan head
Smell-cinnamon, chocolate and vanilla really burst
Taste-cinnamon, chocolate, peppers come through nicely with a little kick, and the vanilla all balances out well. I didn't get a ton of barrel but the combo was very tasty
Feel-thin, not sticky at all
Overall-a fantastic beer with incredible flavors"	4.71
1803	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Just about a perfect beer. I know there's a ton of hype with this one, but damn I still didn't expect it to be as amazingly rich as it was. Super thick and I found it to be very cinnamon forward, which is always a huge plus in my book. One of the best beers I've had all year.	4.79
1804	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Wow, very amazing. Deep dark brown look. Has a great molasses smell and taste. A little spice mixed in with a vanilla cinnamon bomb. The spice was really different and tasted great.	4.72
1805	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2016 Vintage - a nice mix of cinnamon, vanilla and maple on the nose. Taste was heavy on the heat from the Serrano - I expect this to be drinking great after another few months.	4.71
1806	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2016 release. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Voodoo Teku glass. Acquired in a trade with Jake1992 - thank you sir!. Pours a deep brown molasses colored body on the pour, once it's in the glass it's pretty pitch black with cherry highlights. Head is mocha brown, two finger with an aggressive pour, reduces pretty quickly to leave a ring of brown foam and no lacing.. Aromas.. LET'S TALK ABOUT AROMAS! This is one of the best beers I've ever smelled and one of the only ones I've give a 5/5 to in this category.. this is a straight up maple and vanilla bomb on the nose, and not artificial aunt Jemima or vanilla extract, I'm talking rich maple candy and vanilla cookies straight out of the oven. A bit of bourbon in there and chocolate as well. Wow that smells awesome..  1,343 characters	4.66
1807	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	L: Dark brown to black pour with minimal head.. S: Candied molasses, cinnamon, and bourbon.. T: Fantastic sweet chocolate notes dominate the first wave of flavor, followed by a swarm of cinnamon and chili pepper flavor that finishes with a nicely rounded bourbon punch..  572 characters	4.48
1808	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Second bottling released today (8-22-16) aged an extra 7 months in the barrel. Really get the maple and barrel in the nose, not so much the chilli pepper. Initial taste follows the nose with moderate alcohol/pepper warming in the finish. A little bit thin but all in all fantastic beer. Had on draft at the source in meadville	4.84
1809	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Really nice Voodoo beer. Pours a little thinner then what I expected and the feel followed suit. The taste and barrel was very nice though...rich and smooth. Better as it warmed.	4.34
1810	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Dark brown pour with khaki head. Vanilla marshmallow bomb with a spicy kick. That's about all you need to know. Tastes delicious. Smooth, medium plus mouth feel. The maple adds sweetness in the background. The cinnamon blends nicely with the pepper adding some flavor. As this warms the bourbon and barrel character add to the mix and push this up into the 4.5 elite range. Really good. Trade for it.	4.46
1811	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Good but not great. Pour is dark, slightly thin with a dissipating tan head. Nose is very nice, some heat, bourbon and a little vanilla cinnamon combo. First sip is well carbonated, bourbon cocoa notes and then a slight heat from the peppers and spice from the cinnamon. Faint vanilla. As I take further sips the heat builds but still no maple and no sweetness from the vanilla to offset the spice. Then a slight alcohol burn starts to show up in the backend. Which is slightly off putting. I enjoy the heat from the peppers the balance there is good, but the lack of mouthfeel and alcohol burn at the end keep this from being great. Honestly I'd take a regular Huna over this any day.	4.14
1812	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Look - Black as night. Khaki/caramel type rim
Smell - Bourbon, cinnamon and maple (more so as the beer warms)
Taste - Cinnamon dominates at first. Mid palate is bourbon and some chocolate. All peppers on the finish with some lingering heat that sticks around (like that). The maple plays more of a part on the aroma then the taste for me.
Feel - A touch thinner than I would have liked. Still good though. oily type mouthfeel. Overall - The best spiced stout I've had yet. Delicious."	4.75
1813	Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	My man-crush, fiver29, sent this to me for two cans of Furious or something. That guy. I love him. Or maybe it’s just the alcohol. Maybe both. 22 oz. parchment-wrapped, purple-waxed bottle.. I managed to get the rubbery wax off without impaling a finger, which is good. The beer is black. Beautiful, dark, scintillating black. It smells like the gates of heaven. Seriously; bathe me in this before I kick off for Valhalla. Blasphemous malts, sharp peppers, vanilla, sweet sweetness. Damn.. Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel Aged would bring tears of joy to the eyes of Baal. Huge sweet malts intermingle with the (assumed) maple syrup; I wouldn’t have been able to pick it out, but I’m sure that’s what it is. The peppers creep in with a low, sustained heat, rich vanilla, marshmallows out by the lake, mild spiciness that I’ll attribute to the cinnamon. Zero barrel presence, but who cares? Thick, pleasing, & I’d like to shower in this..  1,271 characters	4.59
1814	Clover	Batch 2, drank on 7/14/2019 - thank you goes to jhavs. Light, funky, nice straw and lemon. Tons of barnyard to the nose, a bit salty. This is tremendous - Hill Farmstead has taught me to love funk.	4.74
1815	Clover	Bottled on Oct. 19, 2016. Pours cloudy golden amber orange with a dense creamy lasting white foam head. Smells like honey, oak, sweet grains, apple, pear, lemon, apricot, sweet white grape, wine barrel, sweet spice, mild funk, banana, vanilla, dill, hints of vinegar, dust, with some earthy floral hops. Tastes incredibly balanced and easy drinking with flavors of sweet honey, malty grains, oak, wine barrel, grape, apple, pear, lemon, apricot, banana, sweet spice, mild funk, minimal tartness, vanilla, dill, slight hints of vinegar, dust, with some floral earthy hop notes. Feels soft, smooth, almost juicy, creamy, medium plus bodied, dry with moderate low carbonation. Overall a really great beer.	5
1816	Clover	pours out an essentially clear gold tinged straw color, bright white head is thin with big bubbles and quickly recedes. honestly looks stunning, especially given that it was bottled 4 years ago and originally brewed who the fuck knows when... 6 or 7 years ago?. aromas are originally sort of subdued when its colder, but always wonderfully enticing none the less. as it warms there is an immense bouquet of white wine, floral and grassy, lemon pith and peel, honey comb,toasted oak, vanilla, green apple, slightly musty earth, mellow funky straw quality and hints of nectarines. the beautiful wine, lemon, and honey scents set this one apart in my mind, potentially the best smelling beer ive encountered.. on palate there is this wonderful vinous quality invoking white grape/white wine, mellow tannins, oak, vanilla, more of that crisp and tart green apple, lemon character, bright acidity, slightly lactic, hints of under ripe nectarines and peach skin, peppery spice, grassy and slightly floral, straw and earthy qualities. if i could explain in three words - bright, complex, clean. there is certainly a fair amount of tartness in here, with green apple, lemon, and under ripe white grape leading the way, but its kept well in check by funky complexity, wine flavors, grain character, and oaky notes. having cracked flora B7 two nights ago, I can definitely see the parallel flavors but this one has a ton more depth to it in terms of funky complexity. on mounthfeel is sort of still but somehow manages to retain this very subtle effervescence to it..  1,775 characters	5
1817	Clover	The beer pours a Clear gold with a thin white head that recedes immediately. It has high carbonation. The beer smells of lemon, orange, pear, and oak. It tastes lightly tart, with lemon, apples, pears, wine, and light funk. The feel is light and dry. An excellent Saison from Hill Farmstead.	4.77
1818	Clover	"Enjoyed at GAB bottle share
Light fizzy head, decent retention, hazy blond lemon color. Nose soft creamy wheat, grainy notes, faint honey and nice farmhouse funk, little lemony, some buttery oak. Taste a little weird then really nice, honey and creamy wheat malt, little winey, fair acidity and lemony, tart little flemmy, mild buttery oak, drier finish.  417 characters"	4.46
1819	Clover	Love HF saisons, especially le sarrasin, flora, and sue...didnt really get much from clover however,.... maybe ill try it again some day because the hype was lost on me this time around....	4.09
1820	Clover	375mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed bulb. 2015-03-12 bottled date. Original owner, purchased at the brewery during release.. Pours a lightly hazy sunny yellow effervescent body with a small white head that reduces pretty quickly to leave a ring of lacing and spotty lacing.. Aromas are mesmerizing and complex and really intensify as it warms up. Citrus, white wine and oak sit center stage, with lightly fruity green apple and grapes not too far behind. There's a zesty pepperyness in there as well with straw and funk in the background..  919 characters	4.74
1821	Clover	Pours a clear golden straw color with little to no head - akin to a white wine. Aroma is light and nuanced - pepper, lemon, minor funkiness with a rounded body. Flavor is delightful and nuanced as well...tartness, some biscuit, lemon zest as well. A wonderful beer.	4.41
1822	Clover	375ml bottle, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 2.3.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a bright golden straw color, hazy and cloudy complexion with a thin, soapy finger of white head, little retention but large swatches of soapy lace. The aroma is crazy bright, lemon acidity with soft grain at first bringing out beautiful wildflower aromas with a touch of earthy oak, white wine and light fruity funk. The flavors are beautifully tart, tangy citrus with light pitted stone fruits, peach and apricot with a delicate white wine acidity, smooth oak barrel adds a touch of heft and a bit of earthiness to balance the beer with soft pale grain, light yeasty funk and mineral water. The mouthfeel is good, a heavier more full body that lacks a bit of needed carbonation but still lively and bubbly with a coating and dry finish.. Verdict: A delicious blended beer from Hill Farmstead. Extremely flavorful and exceptionally well balanced, very tart and almost borders on sour but the restraint shown is wonderful. So complex, delicate and bright, bursting with flavor.	4.56
1823	Clover	Pours a bright, strawy golden color with a very small head, which immediately receeds to a thin lacing atop the liquid.. Smells of citraic cellar dust, together with a good amount of mushrooms and wet grass. Has a moldy funk presence to it, which acts nicely as a balance to the prominent citrus. Develops a gentle potato sweetness, together with lots of old hay and a whiff of dried wild berries - pretty complex and well nuanced.. Drinks very soft with a sparkly effervescence in the finish, due to a mineralic quality. Light bodied, easy drinking, while unfolding a plethora of flavors at the same time..  1,362 characters	4.35
1824	Clover	375ml bottle poured into a unmarked oversized wine glass at Hill Farmstead.. A~ clear light yellow with a little head and a little lacing.. S~ acidic up front a little bready brett and lemon/lime..  546 characters	4.08
1825	Clover	375ml bottle, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.. Pours a bright lemon yellow body, slightly hazy, one finger white head, perfect retention with bits of lacing. Smell is oak, mineral, farmhouse funk, slight straw, mild acetic acidity, touch of zest and citrus. Flavour follows, citrus, zest, hay, light farmhouse funk, mild vinegar acidity, light vinous character, mineral, bit of oak. A lot going on here, but this is a fairly restrained beer, really drinkable with a fair bit of complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, perfectly carbonated, dangerously drinkable that one has to pause to appreciate the beer for what it is. Overall, a very tasty barrel aged saison. This didn't have as much of Flora as it did Art; but I've never had Ann so I can't draw a direct comparison to that one, unfortunately.	4.53
1826	Clover	A: Head is approximately half an inch high with some retention, and stylish lacing. The pour itself is lively; slightly transparent via a glowing golden, orange color. S: Aroma is of vinous acidity with grapes, melon, lemon, citrus, and slight candy appeal. The brett, oak, and malt play nicely amongst a quite floral, herbal, and earthy brew. T: Palate is once again kept busy with the subtleties of melon, honey, lemon, grapes, vanilla, some barrel character, and fitting acidity. The convergence of earthy funk, fruit, and dryness to the “taste” is exquisite.  811 characters	4.75
1827	Clover	First bottle I had very fresh, and was a huge let down. 2nd bottle a few months later was awesome. However, I'd still rather have any of the 3 beers on their own that make up this blend.	4.35
1828	Clover	"Clover is another gem from Hill
Look: Nice Yellow pour
Smell: Great funk with subtle barrel smell
Taste: Really nice, not tart at all, classic Hill Farmstead subtle funk
Feel: Really nice and smooth. Loved it."	4.74
1829	Clover	I had the pleasure of opening a bottle of Ann 2014 vintage recently. Such an amazing beer! In my opinion this is right behind Ann. Really special beer. Highly recommended!	5
1830	Clover	Meow. Such a fantastic beer my HF. I can def hear clover meowing when opening the bottle. The initial mouthful was amazing. Such a great light and refreshing beer to drink in the summer time.	5
1831	Clover	Such a terrific beer. Had at a share this past weekend and this was unanimously voted as the best. Had this with Cycle, De Garde, 3F and this took the first prize.	5
1832	Clover	This is one of the most underrated beers that hill farmstead has made. Really not sure where some of the negative reviews are coming from. Gold in color, slightly tart - refreshing and light.	5
1833	Clover	What a gem! Did not see that coming. Clover surprised me with how crisp it was. Highly recommend. @brians52 literally couldn't speak after his first sip.	5
1834	Clover	Golden yellow pour, miniscule head. White wine, oak, citrus dominate the aroma, light vinegar. Citrus, wheat, white wine, oak in the taste, sweet candy notes (lemon drops), tannic, fairly sour. Lower carbonation, perfect mouthfeel. Awesome.	4.86
1835	Clover	Overall it is a very nice BA blend from Hill Farmstead; but for what this commands on the secondary market, I honestly don't think it's worth it. At this point, I feel like I've had much better HF things at much less of a hit to my cellar.	4.18
1836	Clover	"L: Slightly hazy golden pale
S: Slight oak and slight bretty funk
T: A little sweet. Not much tartness in the jaw.
F: Very soft and nicely carbonated
O: Amazing brew. Hill knocks another one out of the park!"	5
1837	Clover	Probably the best Wild I have consumed to this point in my life. I am an IPA guy but couldn't pass up a pour of this when I had the chance! Amazing beer!	4.87
1838	Clover	Lucky enough to locate one of these with a friends help and am I ever glad I did! This is every bit as good as Ann in my opinion and better than Art which are 2 of the 3 beers in the blend. Crisp and clean with light carb and awesome barel notes	5
1839	Haze	"Look Almost perfect
Smell Definitely perfect
Taste Outrageously orange mango pineapple perfection with a perfect finish
Feel Frothy yeasty perfection. a coating of outstanding proportions
Overall A beer that I will not soon forget. If you have the opportunity to have(which I do thankfully) I think it is one of the best beers on the planet. No bulshit. Treeperfection"	4.99
1840	Haze	L-Super juicy, hazy, cloudy........slightly darker than OJ.........2 fingered head that doesn't quit........lacing is very thick. S-smells like a brewery with a mix of tropical hops and grain......papaya, orange and peach......some earthiness. T-taste is more citrus than tropical........orange rind, peach, passionfruit, lime........some pine and pith provides some bitterness in the finish......lingering lemon/lime aftertaste.  677 characters	4.31
1841	Haze	"**
08/22/19. LOOK: hazy light yellow. Foamy white head.. AROMA:
Perfume. Light fruit (maybe papaya or similar, but hard to pinpoint).
TASTE:
Soap, light citrus, perfume, very faint earthy notes and pepper in finish..  295 characters"	3.53
1842	Haze	This one is damn near crazy. I mean, wow! One time my baby mama dressed up in Lonely Lingerie for my 33rd birthday, and just like that surprise, Tree House Haze came to the party like the hot chick on Eric Clapton’s side. This damn thing is so pure and lush, it just may have been baptized. Beautiful and perfect hazy essence, is then bombarded by A massive, I mean MASSIVE apricot backbone it’s damn near insane like Edgar Allen Poe on acid. This is the most perfect Hazy I have ever had.. Cheers!	4.72
1843	Haze	Gorgeous pour, silky smooth grapefruit juice hazy. A heavy nose of pure woods - bark, earth, pine and moss. That chunky goodness follows through in the palate - burnt orange, some cherry almost beyond description. The after finish is lovely with nice candied notes	4.59
1844	Haze	"1 PINT can
Served in a stemless wine glass. This beer pours like orange juice. It is a pale orange color and turbid. It is topped with a couple inches of beige head that leaves great lacing.. The smell is loaded with tropical fruit. I get mango, pineapple, peach, and some grapefruit..  521 characters"	4.39
1845	Haze	"The sum of its parts are perfection.
This is such a yummy beer. Please do not do anything immoral, illegal, or unethical to get this beer.. The look is nice but not exceptional
7 day old can.
The smell is tropical. The taste is mango pineapple with a dry ish bite on the finish. (Alter ego style).  481 characters"	4.86
1846	Haze	Don't bogart that haze, or so the can says. I purchased the can directly from the brewery, it has a canned date of 7/2/2019 5 days prior to the date of purchase. The beer has a beautiful haze and is a thick orange yellow color. I get a slight fruity smell on the nose, very pleasant but faint. I smell peaches, and a little citrusy scent. The taste is peachy with no noticeable bitter flavors and a good amount of carbonation. The alcohol content is also well hidden in the flavor. The beer has a thick mouthfeel and is very smooth. Haze is a good representative of a New England Double IPA.	4.44
1847	Haze	Haze pours a murky orange juice color with a fat and inviting 2-finger head and sticky lacing retention. the smell is huge citrus dominated by stone fruits; apricot and peach, as well as an array of tropical fruits. Not a hint of alcohol on the nose and just a minor hop resin. The taste is bitter orange, peach and guava, that's smooth over the palette with a bitter prickle on the tongue and a light, lingering bitterness.	4.56
1848	Haze	Got some cans of this from my buddy out in Boston.. Pours almost a murky yellow orange with a nice head. Get notes of orange on the nose. Taste follows the nose with a very nice hop profile to balance out the beer. In my opinion one of the best parts of this beer is the malt bill. It really rounds it out. I wouldn’t change a thing about this beer.	4.41
1849	Haze	Another outstanding NE-style IPA from this rockstar brewery. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, even though my expectations were sky high. Juicy, flavorful, creamy, well-hidden ABV and light body. Just an amazing beer. Fairly fresh, too - canned on 5/14/19. Pours a very nice hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and good-looking sheets of lingering lacing that lasted for quite some time. I would have given it higher marks if the lacing or head were more impressive, but the haze looked quite good. Smells of juicy fruit - orange, tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, lemon. Maybe a little mango in there. I didn't quite detect the peach. A good hit of malt, vanilla and a little caramel as well. The trailing off aromas at the end were a nice floral bouquet. The taste follows the nose, and the juiciness and depth of flavor of this beer was just so impressive. The mouthfeel was just to die for - creamy, slightly sticky, full, smooth and that high ABV was so incredibly well-hidden. Drank and felt like a regular IPA, not an imperial one. Just the right amount of carbonation. This paired well with savory dinner and even better with sweet dessert. I'm looking forward to sampling the Julius can that I own, likely tomorrow or the day after!	4.43
1850	Haze	Wonderfully juicy, creamy, big tropical fruit flavors, peachy, mango, nicely balanced by a minty, piney bitterness. Incredible feel, very soft, minimal lingering bitterness. Thick and hazy pale orange/yellow in the glass, lots of lacing. Drink as fresh as possible, a real treat.	4.74
1851	Haze	Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Hazed golden pour with thick fluffy white head. Great retention and lacing.. S: Fruity and sweet. Citrus, peach, and mango..  545 characters	4.5
1852	Haze	Murky, pale gold beer with a big fluffy head. The nose is filled with orange, grapefruit, peach and floral hops. Beer feels light and creamy. The taste is lightly sweet and complex. There is grapefruit, orange, peach and floral components. Finishes with a nice pithy bitterness.	4.6
1853	Haze	This is my all-time favorite beer. It is strong in all aspects — full fine haze, hoppy & fruity nose and bursting with flavors — but has a feel that is particularly outstanding.	5
1854	Haze	A: Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing. S: Lots of peach up front along with some orange and papaya. General citrus and light floral notes in there as well. T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the peach and orange notes and then picks up some citrus and floral hops. This very slowly transitions into some grassy notes with low-moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus and grassy notes.  679 characters	4.61
1855	Haze	Poured from a 16oz can into a Trillium IPA glass.. Look is an opaque hazy yellow with a thin white head.. Little bit of peach and orange on the nose. Subtle but good..  290 characters	4.79
1856	Haze	I usually give beer lofty grades by their level of complexity. This beer breaks with that tradition. It doesn't change flavors from first taste to after taste. It comes at you as one varied whole. The smell is amazing citrus, the taste brings out peach and more, with hop bitterness in perfect balance. One of the best straightforward beers I've ever had!	4.38
1857	Haze	Can (one off from De Bierkoning) @ home. Murky yellow (mustard) colour. Firm white head with just a little retention. Aroma's of dank hops, onion, citrus. Retronasal it's even a bit more onion-y and with a little sweetness to it. Flavour is mild, light sweet, some citrussy sourness and light bitterness. Medium bodied. Soft carbonation. Long finish with dank hops and a great burp. Lovely stuff!	4.34
1858	Haze	Pours with a thick frothy head and has the appearance of orange-pineapple juice and tastes citrus like with a hint of pineapple in the nose. This is a fairly drinkable brew for 8.2% abv. One of my new favorites brewed on 03/05/2019	4.75
1859	Haze	Thanks to BrutalFarce for this one. 16oz can (of course) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a solidly turbid and murky medium orange color with 1-1/2 inches of white head that had decent retention and lacing.. The aroma was the expected combination of fruity hops and no malt or yeast. Pretty much the same on the tongue, with just enough bitterness on the finish to get your attention.. The body was the typical light of the style,with a medium finish. Drinkabilty was fine. Overall, if you like the style, you'll likely love this beer.	2.97
1860	Haze	Milky tan; herb oil, some pellet, slight feet, pineapple rind + grapefruit chunks; porridge, peach, some passionfruit, more oily herb leaf, melon, slight onions, Seville orange, twig + a dirty sediment hit; orange comeback, slight tartness, soft.. 4 4.25 4.5 4 4.25. 9 weeks old + it’s showing. Smooth, juicy, some ringing hops notes... but also signs of hop particulation. Flashes of brightness + shades of what it could be. I guess I’m still chasing Tree House, with an eye on dates...	4.31
1861	Haze	It doesn't get any better.....Haze & Hurricane are like Crack to me. Super flavorful, easy to drink, high ABV doesn't show in the taste. Truly a GREAT beer that everyone who can must try.	4.69
1862	Haze	"Nice lemon color with a 2 finger head that slowly fades. Smell is of tropical fruits and grapefruit. A beautiful balance of flavors that linger on the palate well after.
I am very impressed with this outstanding brew."	4.29
1863	Haze	A legitimately epic NEIPA. Buries a sturdy ABV underneath a blanket of crisp citrus flavor with a spicy bite. Looks incredible in the glass with a golden hue and beautiful creamy head. While Julius remains my favorite for pure flavor, Haze is Tree House’s pinnacle among the standard offerings in my view.	4.84
1864	Black Note Stout	"2017 vintage. I have had this one sitting around for a while. Pours a dense jet black color with no light coming through. Surprisingly good size (medium) dark tan head. Filmy tan lacing on the glass. Rich malty aroma and flavor. A little a coffee, some chocolate. not much of the bourbon, but definitely some oak that adds a touch of bitterness to he mildly sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Some warming alcohol presence but no ""bite"". Goes down very easy. This is a top shelf stout!!!!"	4.19
1865	Black Note Stout	2017 vintage, served just above fridge temp in a warm room, got a pretty wide variety of tastes and smells as it warmed up.. Pour is dark, not viscous or oily. Dark brown, not opaque. Some light around the edges. Minimal dark tan bubbles that fade quickly. Alcohol legs on the glass.. Smells of pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, raisins, plums, licorice and bourbon. Hints of burnt carmel as it warms..  654 characters	4.21
1866	Black Note Stout	2016 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. This beer has aged well to this point. Tons of chocolate in the flavor with some touches of espresso contributing to a slightly dry finish. Black Note is a beer I'll continue to seek whenever available.	4.6
1867	Black Note Stout	"12oz bottle 2017
L nice thick deep black but even with aggressive pour little to no head or lacing
S first hit is licorice followed by some roast notes
T normally not a fan of the fruit cake, licorice coconut stout but this all taste in balance , it sweet but not over the top with some nice roast on the back end .. Mouthfeel average
Overall great stout. Glad in I was able to drink it"	4.32
1868	Black Note Stout	"2017 bottle 10/5/17 - drank 7/26/19
pours black with a half finger of deep khaki head that fades quickly to a ring around the glace. decent lacing
nose is soft bourbon, freshly roasted coffee, roasted malt, chocolate.
taste follows. soft bourbon, touch of vanilla, roasted malt, coffee, dark bittersweet chocolate. a touch of warming alcohol. subtle smoke character as the beer warms.
creamy mouthfeel. lingering bourbon / chocolate mouthfeel.
great beer"	4.07
1869	Black Note Stout	2016 bottle. Pours a viscous jet black. Nose is bakers chocolate, smoke, leather, bourbon, brown sugar and time. Taste follows with dark stone fruit, cherry, plum, raisin , cardboard and old books. Mouthfeel in moderate to full. Surprisingly great with some age.	4.71
1870	Black Note Stout	A - 2 inch tan head with uneven bubbles that holds well. Pitch black.. S - Prunes, cherries, and a hint of wood.. T - Malty and sweet with a hint of bitterness..  281 characters	4.98
1871	Black Note Stout	2017 vintage, bottled on 10/05/17. Purchased at Loosa Brews, Tuscaloosa, AL.. Dark, murky pour, without too much viscosity but a great-looking stout poured from the bottle. A decent amount of beige head rises and settles in a good sized ring around the inside of the glass.. Tons of dark chocolate and dried fruit on the nose that swirl around a backbone of oaky booze and roasty malt. Really a little bit of everything you could ask for of the style in the aromas, with the essence only intensifying as it warms..  1,119 characters	4.16
1872	Black Note Stout	12 oz. bottle poured into sinfter. 2017 vintage.. Pours near black with a thin beige lacing.. Nose: First impression reminds me a lot of Expedition stout. Big dark chocolate and roast character. The barrel comes through subtly with some caramel, vanilla, and oak character..  723 characters	4.22
1873	Black Note Stout	I just had the 2017 Black Note Stout and it was great. It's hard to get where I live so I was happy to finally get my hands on it. What a wonderful stout, full bodied and flavorful and yet smooth and easy drinking. It is truly delicious.. Look: dark brown / black with a half inch creamy mocca colored head. Aroma: chocolate and some bourbon..  458 characters	4.7
1874	Black Note Stout	"Pours so dark it is completely impervious to light. 2 fingers of mocha head slowly fade. Really great chocolate and bourbon aroma, fairly typical yet exceptional. Great chocolate flavor, very intense, bourbon barrel smooths it out and gives it a really nice barrel flavor. Tons of dark roasted malt flavor. Light bitter espresso finish. Full bodied, rich, thick, and creamy. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall an outstanding BBA Imperial Stout, worth buying a few if you come across it.. 5/4/19
12 oz bottle
4.5 rating"	4.54
1875	Black Note Stout	"This one required at least four months bottle aging to round off the heat. But after that it's a mighty fine brew.
Oak, vanilla, and rich medjool dates complement this wonderful stout."	4.5
1876	Black Note Stout	Reviewing this after having it about 2 months ago.. Although was a good imperial stout, considering the hype around this beer and the cost, I was disappointed.	4.14
1877	Black Note Stout	Finally found this beer in a bottle at a grocery store in NYC on 75th and 2nd. I think its good, but not as unbelievable as some of the ratings indicate. The malt taste is solid, and definitely worth drinking, but I've tasted better amongst newer releases (Prison Double Barrel Wham Whams, Other Half 5th, etc.)	4.35
1878	Black Note Stout	2017 12oz bottle poured cold to a tulip glass. Dark mahogany brown with a two-finger bubbly mocha head. Lots of lacing that clings and doesn’t move, at all. Nose is faint vanilla and char, very subdued compared to what I thought it would be. First sips are woody, creamy stout, with a slight bourbon back-end linger. Very balanced flavor profile, with only a slight woody bite in the front. It’s almost like drinking “black.” Yeah, that sounds trippy, but it’s almost like not drinking anything other than a concept. It’s full, creamy, warming, filling. No alcohol presence, but it is warming. Very smooth, very easy to drink. I’m half-way through it, and am sad that it’s almost gone, with only one more on the shelf.	4.42
1879	Black Note Stout	"12oz bottle. 2017 bottling (10/05/017).
Dark brown colored body, with the bottom edge displaying a backlit medium brown. Initial two finger tan head settles back to thick cap with varying bubble sizes (looks creamy). Leaves behind an interrupted pattern of lacing spots and strings.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, dark fruit, and oak bourbon barrel.
Taste of dark roasted malts, which translates to dark chocolate, dark fruit, toffee/molasses, and a touch of espresso. The oak bourbon barrel is present but is a quiet blend to the other components. Minimal bitterness. The aftertaste is like bourbon soaked prunes and figs.
Mouth coating, medium plus mouth feel. Has a smooth texture. Good carbonation which supports the body.
I am pleasantly surprised by the balance and blend of the beer. It has breadth and depth but is also easy to drink. The barrel note is supportive but not overly intrusive. Warming throughout the imbibing process."	4.51
1880	Black Note Stout	Phenomenal. Near perfect Drinkability and finish. This beer is smooth and perfectly balanced. You will not get a traditional place punchbof hops like most imperial stouts and that is not a bad thing.	4.79
1881	Black Note Stout	Review is of the 2017 edition. Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a snifter. Deep blackish-brown colored body, with a dark tan head that left a bit of sticky lacing. Good bourbon character but not harsh, nice alcohol warmth but not overly boozy, substantial mouthfeel without being syrupy. Big aromas and flavors of molasses, vanilla, cocoa, and dark roasted espresso bean, with moderate bitterness, no char, and some slightly sour oaky astringence on the finish. This seems to me to hit its sweet spot at slightly below cellar temperature, where everything settles into balance. As always, YMMV.	4.49
1882	Black Note Stout	Not bad. Just wouldn't buy again. Has a licorice note on the nose and tongue that I don't really like. Overall the balance is good. BB character is mild which is good or bad depending on your preference.	3.73
1883	Black Note Stout	"I have waited to rate until I drank about 18 of 2016 vintage and 18 of 2017 vintage.... It""s a good American Imperial Stout but I really don't think it is worth the hype and I am a Bells Brewery FANATIC! My main problem with the beer is the mouth feel. It does not compare with Bells Expedition Stout that is so thick and creamy. I was sooo expecting more! The flavor is great, the taste is okay but not overwhelming. I will always but this beer but I was a bit disappointed."	3.93
1884	Black Note Stout	2017 bottle poured into fluted snifter.. Pour is black with a thin and creamy fine bubbled head. The head settles fast into a few bubbles and a thin ring around the glass.. Aroma has a nice smooth mix of booze, earthy barrel and rich/sweet malts..  587 characters	4.4
1885	Black Note Stout	"Look: Pours black with minimal head.
Smell: Rich, malty, boozy stout. The bourbon barrels come through strong.
Taste: Rich and creamy, with a heavy booze layer. Sweet.
Feel: Thick. Like a well made hot chocolate.
Overall: Really tasty and savory, but short of special."	3.61
1886	Black Note Stout	Pours clear midnight pitch black but appears garnet hued when light is shined into it. The pour produces barely a finger of frothy, short-lived, dark mocha head that recedes to a thin collar ring and only a hint of island cap leaving minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma is toasted/burnt malt, bourbon/oak-wood fronted backed by Hershey's chocolate syrup, dark fruits, toffee and some coffee. Taste is almost the inverse: Hershey's chocolate syrup, fig/prune and caramel/toffee/molasses notes lead with bourbon, oak-wood vanilla, dark chocolate and coffee hints in the latter half of the sip and finish producing a bourbon, cocoa, burnt & bitter aftertaste. Roasted/toasted and sweet malt notes, fruitiness and barrel aging make this very, very nice. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low carbonation, chewy, tongue coating creamy and silky smooth with a light prickle.	4.5
1887	Black Note Stout	2017 Vintage. Appearance - dark black body with nearly no head. Smell - chocolate, molasses, bourbon.  474 characters	4.35
1888	Black Note Stout	"12oz Bottle
$5.99 single
Village Dell & Wine - Rice Lake, WI. Black Note manages to glug from the bottle. It literally made glugging sounds. It's as black as they come. So perfectly black that you see perfect reflections around the glass. The mocha head is amazingly creamy and dense and easy forming. A finger plus head comes easily with leaves behind puffy lace and drink lines with each sip. This is how big, bold, bad ass stouts ought to look.. The nose on this beer is up there in that elite category which is rarefied air. The barrel aging seems to be expertly accomplished. We have a big, fudgy, molten chocolate cake of a stout. This beer embraces the chocolate notes barley can produce while shying away from the char in other versions. A splash of cream and a solid nuttiness along with all that fudge make the base while the barrel adds amazing depth. They managed to pull the bourbon flavors of caramel, vanilla, and soft baking spice without pulling the heat. There's also that marshmallow character I get from only the most well handled barrel aged beers..  2,237 characters"	4.53
1889	Anabasis	Blend #3.. Pours a deep, rich brown in color - minimal head, not very much carbonation (favorable, in my opinion). It's tremendously rich and sweet, with a fair amount of hop presence, with a fair amount of barrel - not as much as I'd expected.. I think I'd prefer Aaron on any given day, but Anabasis is still tremendously good.	4.66
1890	Anabasis	i have long been trying to track this one down, and i am stoked to finally have gotten the chance to enjoy it, blend three, an awfully fine example of the style, adjunct free if i understand it right, and truly wanting for nothing. it certainly is a beast of a beer, not just at this strength, but also with this amount of oak and sweetness, its a lot of everything, and its a proper sipper to say the least. deep deep caramel in color, reddish in the right light, neither murky nor clear, someplace in between, with just a short frothy khaki colored layer of foam on it from the bottle. the nose is crazy, an awful lot of bourbon and oak, i think it was heaven hill barrels they uses for this, and two years in them! heavy vanilla, wet tobacco, and english toffee abound there, some light tannins from the wood, as well as some oxidation when i taste it, something i never really mind in the style, and really is a sign of its maturity. the malt is huge, sweet like brown sugar and maple, and carrying that vanilla tune pretty nicely though the whole drink, a ton of body on it and a long linger even with the abundant alcohol at the end, its persistent. oxidation meets a robust english yeast strain too, bready and doughy even, adding a lot of depth. no hops really to speak of, although overall this somehow has some balance between all the elements at the end. whiskey for miles, boozy and sweet, dense and even chewy, but also fully wintery, warming, and satisfying. something to be shared for sure, but a prime example of the style and what extended barrel ageing looks like. impressive and worthy of being celebrated. that said, not the most interesting barleywine i have ever had, not the most dialed in i dont think either, but a special beer without a doubt!	4.42
1891	Anabasis	Pours murky brown. Nose is figs, raisins, toffee, caramel, butterscotch, bourbon, char. Taste is a bit more subtle, with a well balanced profile of the aforementioned aromas. Nice, sticky slick mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice example of the style. Almost drinks like a stout.	4.66
1892	Anabasis	Pours a very dark brown with ruby accents as it leaves the bottle and on the edges of the glass. No head. Aroma is toasty, roasty, caramel, butterscotch, herbal and floral hops. Flavor profile is butterscotch, toffee, caramel, and roasty, toasty malts. Big, deep complexity. Mouth feel is thick with a chewy texture. Overall, big, firm and filling. This is amazing.. Served from a 750mL bottle at the Side Project Cellar.	4.65
1893	Anabasis	Batch 3 at Side Project - The Cellar.. Incredibly dark. Very much a stout appearance. No foam. Toffee, rich, sweet caramel. Great mouthfeel and smooth. Rivals King Henry.	4.75
1894	Anabasis	Old checkin. Had b1 alongside several derivations and TG stouts and it stole the show. Huge bourbon aroma, thick mouthfeel, complex chocolate and stout flavors, along with malty caramel and raisin sweetness. Had b2 a year later and it was great, maybe less bourbon forward than b1.	4.9
1895	Anabasis	"There are two things that most craft beer nerds get wrong about Anabasis:. 1) The pronunciation of its name
2) The perceived G.O.A.T status of this beer in the realm of barleywines. It took nearly four years to track down a pour of this legendary beer, but only a fraction of that time to realize that I -along with the majority of the craft beer world- had been deceived by the Hype-Lords of the American Midwest..  2,209 characters"	4.43
1896	Anabasis	12/2017 - incredible aromas of bourbon, light anise, plum, tobacco, and earthiness; smooth creamy body with raisin, sherry, tobacco, and nice semisweet flavors; supremely luscious mouthfeel that just blows me away; the finish is surprisingly dry and balanced.	4.88
1897	Anabasis	A mix between a stout and a barleywine, lil roasty and underwhelming next to some of the biggest barleywines we had next to it blind. Not something I will be going after in the future.	4.08
1898	Anabasis	Had batch 2 on site from a keg. Easily the best barleywine I have ever had in my life. This shit is fire. If you are able to track down a bottle (will take a lot), you wont be disappointed	4.96
1899	Anabasis	750ml waxed bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a darker brown body, one finger offwhite head, one finger white head, good retention, nice lacing. Smell is rich caramel, earth, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanillin. This is very much the barrel-aged barleywine. Flavour follows, heavy oak, caramel, toffee, vanillin, oak, slight earth, nice complexity, fairly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, nice toffee and barrel on the finish. A very nice and heavy barleywine with a lot of sweetness; it doesn't seem to offer more oomph than say, Revolution Straight Jacket for example. I feel like this is a bit overhyped despite this being an excellent barrel aged English Barleywine.	4.49
1900	Anabasis	"Batch 2. L: darker brown pour but black in he glass. No head, lifeless.
S: bourbon and caramel sweetness, by not a huge aroma.
T: more flavor as it it warms, but this is bourbon barrel forward. This had some typical caramel covered raisin sweetness, but those flavors are heavily trumped by the barrel. A bit of a let down but still amazing because the barrel is delicious and smooth.
F: medium thickness but so darn smooth. Slight booze and heat but in a good way.
O: fantastic beer, definitely let it warm to bring more of the typical barleywine flavors in balance with the great barrel."	4.77
1901	Anabasis	"B2 at the cellar. Traded my first bottle(b1) 18 months and 62 trades ago as my first trade. Thanks Morandi, especially enjoyed befuddlement especially, but I'm happy to finally have this puppy tonight!. It's dark brown. No bubbles. Smells boozy as booze. Rum booze. Booze good. Stell-ahh!. Taste begins with Carmel (autocapitalize as if we're in Carmel by the sea. by the Sea). Quoth my buddy ""the booze kind of dissipates. How does he do that? You're writing this down? I'm getting orange. And then the coconut. You have to mention the coconut. Like a toasted toasted pina colata."".  1,060 characters"	4.62
1902	Anabasis	Batch #2 at the brewery on 3-4-17. Shared 3 ways so my wallet didn't feel the pain that much. Pours extreme dark brown with no head. This is a spectacular example of how barrel aging a barley wine can transform into a whole different brew. Sweet and succulent on the nose, with toffee and caramel notes blended with a light barrel note. Taste is off the chart. There was a grainy particulate or something that my tongue picked up that melted on the tongue and the toffee flavor that became borderline chocolate. Incredible.	5
1903	Anabasis	"Had bottle 1 during a Barley wine Bottle Share.
L: DARK brown with a tinge of amber
S: Really nice carmelly and malty aroma.
T: Very well balanced of carmel, raisin, roasted malts.
F: Medium to thick
O: This was simply amazing. I love barely wines and this was probably one of the best ones I have ever gotten to enjoy. I had this along with Great from Apline, Aaron, and Brew 1000 from Fremont and was the best of those IMO."	5
1904	Anabasis	Amazing barley wine with wonderful layers of bourbon, dark fruit and raisins with light caramel notes as well . Had this as part of a barley wine tasting with several other world-class barley wines and this one stole the show!	5
1905	Anabasis	had this one blind out of 18 total barleywines.. looks amazing, puddle water. the way i like my bwines! super dark in the glass slight brown head. smells is slightly muted at first but with the whirl of the glass juicy raisin jumps out. great bourbon, you can tell it will be good.  785 characters	4.93
1906	Anabasis	Pours full and rich with creamy carb, praline sweetness and slight booze on the nose, huge raisin and oats on the taste with some prune, fig, wood, and slight heat, creamy mouthfeel goes down dangerously easy. One of my white whales that took a team of us to bring down. Thanks Patrick and Myles!	5
1907	Anabasis	Just an incredible beer, strong but smooth, boozy but not overly so. Tastes a little of caramel, but not overly sweet. Certainly the best barleywine I've ever had, possibly the best beer.	4.98
1908	Anabasis	750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Murky deep brown body with a small khaki head. Absurdly boozy aroma. Brown sugar, raisins, bourbon. Nutty and oaky. Taste is also extremely boozy. Bourbon and oak dominate. Nutty and caramel malts. Bitter. I expect a lot more sweetness. It's sweet, but not absurdly sweet. Heavy body. Medium carbonation. It gets pretty sweet as I drink it, but still really good. Well done.	4.34
1909	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	10oz. tap sampled from a snifter at Ansari's - Eagan, MN. So, I love vanilla and for me this beer is absolutely delicious. Strong vanilla in the aroma and flavor. Thick and creamy. If someone told me I had to pick just one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this would be in the running.	5
1910	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Vanilla definitely takes the forefront on the nose, with a little bit of woodiness, as taste adds toasted double chocolate chip cookie with sweet vanilla glaze. A very mild bourbon heat and viscous, syrupy thick body finishes sticky, semi-dry. The after taste is total s'mores. Oh hey, #4000!	4.21
1911	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	01/2017 - Lovely marshmallow, vanilla, wee graham, bourbon up front; sweet, creamy, bourbon, chocolate on body with vanilla lingering; amazing mouthfeel that's chewy and luscious.	4.53
1912	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	A: An oily, black pour with brown highlights: length, retention, and lacing are minimal. S: Aroma is well involved with traces of bourbon coinciding to arrays of vanilla fudge, caramel brownies, cocoa, oak, and tones of smoked molasses with faint, whiskey-soaked dark fruit coming on delicately. T: Vanilla surmises the palate in exquisite fashion accompanied by milk chocolate mounds, marshmallows, roasted caramelized-nuts, oak, and coffee infused creamer with traces of fruit, and hints of smoked bark.  793 characters	4.26
1913	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	A 11.2 fl. oz. bottle, bottled on 5th September 2016 and a best before date of 5th September 2026. Poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Dark dark brown, near black in colour with pretty much no head and no lacing.. Aroma: Vanilla, caramel, cream, chocolate, cocoa, oak and bourbon with hints of alcohol soaked raisin..  576 characters	4.57
1914	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Tasted from bottle. 2016 version. Pours dark brown with minimal tan head. Vanilla, caramel and bourbon aroma. Huge vanilla flavor along with caramel, coffee, molasses, bourbon. If you like vanilla you’ll like this one. Very well done.	4.32
1915	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Overwhelming vanilla smell and taste - hides the alcohol remarkably well and very smooth. I felt it was a bit thin and more like a porter consistency, but nevertheless it is quite decadent and worth the effort if you are fond of vanilla.	4.37
1916	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Picked up a bottle of this at Julio's. Shared with JLindros.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark brown almost black with a thin mocha head that faded quickly. Nice legs.. S - Aromas of massive vanilla beans galore, raw vanilla as well. Super rich. Light coffee aroma, coffee ice cream like with some light bourbon cream notes as well..  760 characters	4.38
1917	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Thanks to rudzud. Light fizzy head mostly just bubbles from the pour, long thick legs, pitch black beer. Nose loads and loads of raw vanilla and vanilla chocolate mixed milk shake, dark choc cocoa, m&m candy chocolate, choc syrup, vanilla syrup, coffee ice cream, little roast, flashes of barrel and sweet bourbon cream.  744 characters	4.4
1918	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Oh hell this is one glorious beer which delivers on all levels. Spot on chewy mouth feel and the vanilla helps round out the finish. Nose hides the alcohol well and vanilla is the predominant note although the taste is full
If rich fudge, syrupy vanilla, rad note of barrel char and devil's cut. Would always enjoy this and happy to try or buy again."	4.6
1919	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"330ml bottle.
Dark black liquid with some reddish glints, small beige head.. Nose is crazy vanilla, caramel, chocolate, coffee, small bourbon hints.. As intense in nose, vanilla is all over place in taste, but in a good way, roasted malt, coffee, medium to high sweetness, very dark chocolate bitterness, we can taste some bourbon and woody notes as well. It feels like having a vanilla malty ice cream in a glass..  575 characters"	4.8
1920	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours dark chocolate in color. Aroma is the bigges vanilla ever. Flavor is vanillla upon more vanilla. This is a vanilla milk shake. Body is a little thin but overall pretty fantastic.	4.57
1921	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Not going to get to technical on this one. Dark, minimal head, smooth moderate to full mouth feel. That's said, big vanilla and bourbon on the nose, on the palate, forward and on the finish, awesome. Haven't had the base Vanilla Shake yet, but it's chilling in the cellar. Really looking forward to it even more now that I've had the BB edition.	4.65
1922	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Bottled 5/9/16 (""best buy 5/9/26""); drank 4/22/17 @ the Yarchives.. Brown/black appearance.. A violent pour yielded a small tan head; minimal lace..  584 characters"	4.23
1923	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a taster. Thanks Kevin for sharing this beer.. Dark brown body with a light tan head.. Medicinal vanilla, sweet vanilla extract, cherry, finish is lightly bitter . Low carbonation and a little watery.	4.13
1924	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I really enjoy the Mikkeller Beer Geek series but this one took things to the next level. Its aroma is incredible and packs a ton of vanilla flavor with it. It's incredibly smooth for a 13% and the Bourbon taste is barely noticeable, a good thing for a sweet stout like this one.	4.88
1925	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Feel like this is overhyped. It's a nice BA vanilla stout for sure but I was underwhelmed by it. Pours dark brown, not opaque. Minimal head. Smell is some vanilla but I honestly expected alot more. Taste is exactly the same...some vanilla but I expected alot more. Has that typical Mikkeller aftertaste that I'm not a fan of. Feel was average, maybe a touch on the thinner side. Overall, this is good. I wouldn't classify it as great.	4.23
1926	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I've never had a beer where the BA version was soooooo much better / different. I've had regular vanilla shake a number of times, and it never was that remarkable. But the BA version is very different. If you like vanilla stouts grab this one!	4.86
1927	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2016 vintage, poured from the bottle into a tulip. Huge vanilla on the nose as it warms...well balanced with the barrel but not overly hot. Solid mouthfeel.	4.71
1928	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	330 mL bottle. Pours a murky black with no head. The thinnest of collars. Smells of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and whiskey. Hefty oak. Tastes very oaky. Coffee throughout. Vanilla kicks in behind the coffee and makes it seem sweet. Bourbon kicks in and makes it seem less sweet. Eventually they combine to a bourbon and vanilla finish. Boozy and medium heavy with low carbonation. Excellent. Way over the top with the vanilla, but the barrel keeps it interesting.	4.14
1929	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This was really good. Had is side by side with fundamental observation. The look was a nice dark look, good thickness. The smell was the best vanilla forward smell I've had from a vanilla stout. The taste was straight vanilla and barrel and I loved it. The mouth feel was perfect.	4.9
1930	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Beer #1000. A: deep oil black. Thin khaki head. Lacing like a pornstar panties.. S: count chocula cereal. Milk chocolate and marshmallows. Bourbon. Vanilla. Barrel. Vanilla root beer milkshake float..  631 characters	4.77
1931	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"L - dark black with a thin tan head
S - LOTS of vanilla, but not cloying
T - follows the nose, with no noticeable bite from the barrel, very smooth and enjoyable
F - velvety
O - an awesome beer that deserves an audible exclamation when having it!"	4.8
1932	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2016 batch, on-tap served in a Mikkeller stemmed glass at Mikkeller Bangkok.. Sinful black with some deep ruddy brown hue along the edge when hits the light, rich tan frothy head builds up to stand for a while before subsiding to some foamy sheet atop and leaving plenty of refined yet sticky lace sip by sip.. In a nose, the aroma delicately comprises of big vanilla, very rich dark and creamy chocolate, cocoa, mocha, caramel, dark bread, toasted biscuit, charred nut, also with some touch of bourbon that is reminiscent of oaky, woody, spicy, and mellow fruit..  1,406 characters	4.7
1933	Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Batch 2 drank on 12/21/2016. Really nice beer right here. A perfect even blend of vanilla, milk chocolate, and oaky bourbon (like 1/3 each) with some other hints of nice notes as well like caramel and a sweet dark fruit like raisin. Feel was silky smooth but not overly thick. Very enjoyable.	4.6
1934	Triple Shot	No bottling date but I picked this up at the brewery way back on 6/13/19. It says not to age but I wasn’t in a rush to drink it with so many other beers in the fridge having shorter lifespans.. Pours beautifully, as a beer this big should. Nose is quite boozy but everything is there. The flavor/feel is soooo creamy, so damn roasty/malty, the coffee is massive. I love it. Dark chocolate and espresso roast coffee dominate the entire experience. Slightly sweet, perfect bitterness, amazing drinkability for the statistics of this beer. World-class!	4.59
1935	Triple Shot	this stuff is divine, and in such an unassuming package too, crazy! thanks to my brother for sourcing this rarity, thought i might never get to taste this one. its a treat too, so much coffee, enough so even that is stands out as way more than the vanilla bean double shit, which we enjoyed right before this one. its almost gritty and bitter in comparison, but the vanilla sure did a lot to sweeten that up and round it out. here we have a truer expression of the coffee, more isolated in a way, and i love how robust it is, almost as much coffee as it is beer, although i do get a little booziness poking through this one in the aroma. the coffee has deep chocolate tones to it, a little spiciness even, a rigid sort of bitterness mid palate, and a real richness as well, notes of molasses and maple work in from the grain here, and there is a neat almost amaretto layer. maybe not quite as complex as the double shot was to me, a little more straight forward from the grain, but i love the way the coffee manifests itself in here, about as forward as i have known it to be in any beer, and lingering forever on the palate after each slow sip. this is the ultimate coffee beer really, and the freshness of the coffee really stands out as well, especially for something that was bottle many months before we opened it. it was wonderful to finally get to drink some of these hard to get tree house stouts, thanks to my brother! these were unforgettable!	4.5
1936	Triple Shot	A- 500ml bottle pours a motor oil black brew into a snifter. A very thick and creamy cap rises out of the beer like a layer of dark cocoa brown cream atop the liquid. Great head retention and massive piles of lacing stick to the glass.. S- A high quality very dark chocolate bar situated beneath a mountain of coffee. The coffee and chocolate notes dominate the aroma and they both bring that special dark fruitiness that you find on high quality cocoa and coffee beans. Suggests quite a bit of sweetness and fudge comes to mind. There is a certain brightness that probably comes from the coffee that provides some balance to the deep dessert and espresso notes. Toasted nuts, caramel and cocoa powder hints.. T- A lot going on as the beer is on and leaves the taste buds but as exepcted rich grains and coffee absolutely saturate the taste buds complimenting a moderately high level of sweetness. If I had to describe this with minimal descriptors, the brew overall tastes like a well balanced espresso blend bringing the fruity light roast and darker bitter roast flavors as well, the best of both worlds. Honestly just a massive flavor profile. Cherry, bitter dark chocolate, fudge, charred barley, chocolate malt, toasted nutty, molasses and chocolate covered raisin notes meet the rich coffee flavors mentioned. Decadent and a sipper. With time the dark roast flavors take over but it seems like a fifty fifty as the beer early on is fruitier and nuttier..  1,950 characters	4.58
1937	Triple Shot	"Traded for this last week as this was one of the few beers that I've had here at the house recently that was fresh. Loved the iterations of the Double Shot that I traded for (with the same person) a few weeks back and this was just as good as those. The label describes this as being ""like a melted chocolate bar"" and that would be quite apt how rich, silky, and luscious this was. If you love Stouts of any kind, then this would easily be one worth seeking!. Good pour to this as the liquid was dark, smooth, and topped off with plenty of mocha head. A decent amount of lacing was left behind as I sipped it although it was quite splotchy as no easily visible rings were discernible. Loads of bright coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee creamer were in the slightly muted nose as they emerged quite strongly in the taste. Espresso bean, raspberry slickness, boozy brandy, brown sugar, and booze (!) emerged on the palate once this fully warmed up. Sure, this packed a punch but it was so smooth and sweet that it was like the softest boxing gloves were put on before the blow was delivered. Lactose, and brown sugary sweetness came through before I finished this off as there was a powdery undertone to the silky smoothness that was this beer's hallmark.. Oddly enough, this felt stronger than it was in actuality, as it felt like a Breakfast Stout that was taken up a few notches. Not quite a dessert beer, this would be fine after dinner but there wasn't a lot of fruit or tartness to balance out the chocolate and coffee that formed this beer's backbone. I'll always love the canned beers from Tree House that I've been fortunate enough to get my hands on but along with their other bottles,this proved that all that glitters doesn't come in the form of aluminum. Well worth seeking out and taking the time to savor!"	4.44
1938	Triple Shot	Pours black with two and a half fingers of dense caramel-colored foam. Head retention is sublime. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, earthy, caramely and bready malts with rich coffee coming over the top and lingering into the finish. Chocolate (milk and cocoa) and toffee add little bits of sweetness to the middle and finish of the beer. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty, nutty, earthy, bready and caramely malts. Beyond malts is a dense cup of medium-bodied, coffee, with hints of nuts and chocolate. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a rich, creamy texture that creates a decadent experience in itself. Overall, rich coffee paired beautifully with a myriad of dark malts for a decadent, robust stout.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 500mL bottle.	4.72
1939	Triple Shot	This one pours a very dark black color, with a small but tight and long lasting head, and a ton of lacing.. This smells like caramel candy, vanilla, dark fruit, roasty coffee, cookie dough, big fudge, and herbal coffee.. This is really quite tremendous - TH stouts are still worth a look, it seems. The coffee is dominant, but adds a lot of intriguing flavor twists and turns. There’s certainly some caramel and toffee, plus dried fruit. There’s also waves of a chocolate truffle that mix well with the very chocolate base stout. I also get some vanilla/hazelnut creamer, as well as cookie dough. This is extremely complex..  828 characters	4.51
1940	Triple Shot	TREE HOUSE TRIPLE SHOT COFFEE STOUT 6/22/19. Poured from the 16.9 oz. bottle into a Samuel Smith English tulip.. a; Opaque black with an inch thick brown head which receded slowly to very thick surface foam with the look of a chocolate milk shake, and very dense lacing..  614 characters	4.64
1941	Triple Shot	"500 ml. bottle.
Moderate pour yields a one inch dark tan head over near black body with exquisite lacing. Nose of dark malt, coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. Taste mirrors the nose and then some. Wow! The chocolate is very powerful after it warms even more, in that it has taken over the coffee and now this is all chocolate-covered-cherry-like. I'm glad I took this out of the fridge 45 minutes before opening. Super velvety feel and overall, as of now, one of my favorites from TH. Cheers to all involved for an extraordinary beer!"	4.67
1942	Triple Shot	Superb dark body, opaque and solid, brown head, tiny bubble lines and nearly full curtain. The nose is full of malt, roasty and toasty, with cherry and dark chocolate flavors joining it in the taste. The feel is full and satisfying. Delicious.	4.43
1943	Triple Shot	500ml bottle.. Pours opaque black with a thick head of brown. Plenty of tattered lacework with decent retention. Sugar-dusted espresso with chocolate syrup in the nose. Full bodied with an oily, viscous mouthfeel. Sweet chocolate with shades of dark coffee and a hint of nougat. Finishes sweet with a nice balance of coffee and chocolate.. Was expecting much more coffee.	4.35
1944	Triple Shot	Viscous burnt black with a tall stark mocha head that slowly settles to a lumpy bubbly blanket with creamy wisps, a thick collar and a few reaching arms of lace.. Smell is earthy and nutty yet still sharp and acidic coffee with notes of chocolate pie and...whip cream vodka? I guess this is where the ABV shows itself most readily.. Taste is notably acidic but not too much so, as the coffee has a powerful semi-bitter presence that's both nutty liqueur-like and also mocha-esque. It's tangy, tingly and zippy for something so dark, almost cola-like with notes of sassafras, but the body is a silky smooth medium with a hefty carbonation that quickly zips into a softly cotton dry finish.	4.1
1945	Triple Shot	batch 1000 500ml for NYE. having had 2bl shot two different batches, this was in my pervue. This was over and beyond expectations. Best stout I had in 2018.	4.42
1946	Triple Shot	Big thanks to rudzud for picking this up, I think. Just got through hell trying to add water filter system to the house, trying to hook it up to the house water line was hell, so need this. Pours an inky black color thick heavy long legs too, a dark fizzy head fades semi quickly, but beads back up when I swirl. Nose big dark roast, roasted malts, roasted coffee, not super fresh coffee but some roasted espresso like toasted nutty coffee, a little licorice, some very dark chocolate cocoa , fudge brownie, etc.  1,072 characters	4.53
1947	Triple Shot	500ml bottle, snifter glass. Dark black body, half finger mocha head, fair retention, no lacing. Smell and flavour is a massive and delicious espresso and a bit of roast bean, smooooooooooth milk chocolate, a bit of fudge, lactose, a bit of tobacco and roast malt. Comes out to something like a massive espresso shake, sort of like a frappe. Full bodied, silky and smooth, creamy and full-flavoured. Delicious!	4.5
1948	Triple Shot	One of the best mouthfeel stouts I've ever had, unfortunately I'm not a big fan of the yeast character of Tree House stouts but this was my favorite of the ones I've tried.	4.17
1949	Triple Shot	"Sampling a cold bottle poured into my snifter. Beer is a dark chocolate brown on the pour with a creamy tan head of about 1 cm. The foam sticks around as a wispy surface layer for most of the sampling. The aroma is dark chocolate and toffee with some brown sugar. I also get a little bit of coffee ground and a background of vanilla. I dont really get any hops nor booze on this beer.
The first sip reveals a silky smooth body with mild and gentle carbonation that rolls across my palate.
Flavor is sweet chocolate and some brown sugar. I also get roasted malt and coffee grounds mixing with a bit of molasses. This flavor then rolls back to chocolate, more of a dark chocolate brownie note here.
I dont get any booze and hops are absent. The beer is a very drinkable stout and Im glad I got to try it.
Pick one up next time TH is offering several stout beers."	4.52
1950	Triple Shot	03/2015 - This beer is absolutely incredible - seek it out! Intense espresso, vanilla, toffee, lactose on the nose; superb coffee, rich chocolate, maple, vanilla on the palate; solid mouthfeel but it thins out of the finish; rich, chocolaty finish.	4.46
1951	Triple Shot	beautiful looking brew, quite aromatic and delicious flavors on palate. there is a robust and deep chocolate quality - getting milky chocolate bar, bakers chocolate, oreos, chocolate chip cookie, caramel, robust and slightly bitter coffee notes, a mellow dark fruit flavor and a massive roastyness. smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.	4.52
1952	Triple Shot	Very dark appearance with slight dark brown/tan head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a coffee and malt. Taste is a very smooth pleasant coffee and malt with some chocolate.	4.67
1953	Triple Shot	Pours dark and thick with lacing tan head. Smell is coffee and dark roasted malts with dark chocolate. Taste is smooth cold brew coffee with no bitterness at all commonly found in coffee stouts. Silky, lingering mouthfeel. Overall a very pleasant easy sipper.	4.63
1954	Triple Shot	"Beer #2000. Look: dark cola black with solid lacing and a thick creamy 1in khaki head.
Smell: roasted malts, chocolate and a ton of coffee.
Taste: smooth coffee flavors, some Carmal and vanilla notes.
Feel: medium mouth and carbonation... super smooth and silky mouth feel."	4.59
1955	Triple Shot	Really as good as you get for a non ba stout. Fluffy and creamy with heavy coffee. Not a huge treehouse stout fan but the hot this one out of the park!	4.84
1956	Triple Shot	Tasted from bottle. Pours black with dark brown head. Aroma is big time coffee, molasses, cocoa. Super creamy. No hint of alcohol. Really it’s like a thick coffee. Milk chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, cream and of course coffee. Incredibly good.	4.82
1957	Triple Shot	Poured from bottle into shaker, good 1 finger dark tan head that hangs around a while, recedes to a pool after a few, good lacing. Smells predominantly of chocolate, very little coffee on the nose. Taste follows the nose, good dose of sweet chocolate. Very little coffee coming thru, very little bitterness/bite, hidden mainly by the sweetness.	3.91
1958	Triple Shot	The beer pours Pitch Black with a big fluffy khaki head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of baker’s chocolate, cocoa powder, roasted coffee beans, bark, and almonds. It tastes of roasty coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, bark, and almonds. It has a medium body. A great coffee beer, a heftier version of Double Shot.	4.53
1959	Bourbon Paradise	From a 12 oz. bottle into a PAA Dino glass, this beer pours out with a slick blackness and almost touching a motor oil thickness. Caramel colored bubbles that disappear as fast as they can form leave no crown. 4.25. The nose carries in a beautiful bourbon presence with dark fruit, from plums to sweet raisins. Thick, sticky vanilla, marshmallow like, and a touch of coconut linger throughout the background while you can also pick up fudgey chocolate. 4.75. The taste follows the nose well and doesn’t let me down with the thick, sticky marshmallow vanilla presence. Touches of the dark fruit mix with an underlying coconut accent. Chocolate and vanilla cake batter. So beautiful with everything working together. 5.  1,187 characters	4.9
1960	Bourbon Paradise	Stark black with a thin tan blanket dying off to nothing but a tar surface.. Woody bourbon strength comes with some heat as luscious vanilla brings up softening, decadent touches of brownie and caramel, while the coconut doesn't have a huge influence. As it warms, I get hints of pecan pie in the aroma.. The slick body has a fine carbonation before coming to a semi-dry burning finish, bringing back up some woody char on the exhale.	4.18
1961	Bourbon Paradise	Unusually smooth and drinkable for a nearly 16% Stout. I really enjoyed the standard Paradise and this one-upped it. Damn good. Drink it - with caution!	4.53
1962	Bourbon Paradise	12 oz. bottle @ home. Pours a pitch black colour. Brown head that quickly disappears. Aroma's of cocos, milk chocolate, light boozy alcohol/bourbon. Retronasal there's a bit more of the bourbon, with chocolate, cocos, some red fruit. Flavour is heavy sweet, chocolatey, bourbon-y, a bit roasted. Alcohol feel is definitely strong and warming but not burning. Medium to full bodied. Finishes with bourbon and chocolate. Great but dangerous stuff.	4.21
1963	Bourbon Paradise	B2. L - Pitch black appearance. Tan head that dissapates completely. S - Bourbon and coconut up front. Start to get some chocolate and vanilla.  463 characters	4.6
1964	Bourbon Paradise	"2018 Vintage
High expectations with this one.. Pitch black no head. Compared to the original version, the bourbon sure makes its way in the mix with a pungeant dank wood presence. The coconut and vanilla are there too.
The really high abv is hardly noticeable with the certain sweetness of the beer. Strong chocolate notes.
The balance is nice.
The mouthfeel is thick and sticky.
A very good beer"	4.51
1965	Bourbon Paradise	12/2017 - I am excited to see how this improves over time. For now, it has incredible bourbon, coconut, vanilla, cocoa aromas; decadent body with no apparent heat; creamy, sweet finish. There's absolutely a lot of bottle variation on this though - the first time I was blown away, the second time, not as much.	4.55
1966	Bourbon Paradise	Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown with beige head. Cocoa, bourbon, coconut and just a hint of vanilla on aroma. Thick and chewy. Chocolate, caramel, molasses, coconut flavors. Faint vanilla finish. Excellent BA stout.	4.75
1967	Bourbon Paradise	A 12 fl. oz. bottle with a Julian bottled on date of, I want to say, 32517, but it’s not so clear. Meaning that it was bottled on 21st November 2017. Poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Black in colour with a thin mocha brown head that dissipated quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving only sparse lacing.. Aroma: Roasted malts, milk chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toasted coconut, bourbon and oak..  852 characters	4.67
1968	Bourbon Paradise	"Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Date stamp is '32017'.
Black colored body, with a very thin dark brown edge when back lit. One finger mocha brown head which settles into a thick creamy cap. Spots of lacing are left behind.
Aroma is dark roasted malts, with a wafting of vanilla, milk chocolate, and bourbon barrel notes.
Taste is rather sweet, with dark roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon barrel notes. Coconut is minimal but adds to the sweetness. Not bitter at all.
Thick and slightly syrupy mouth feel. Body cap is fed by active rising bubbles.
Tasty, bourbon barrel aged stout, but not overly complex."	4.31
1969	Bourbon Paradise	"Drank from a 12fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Served in a teku
Review #1600. Thick and viscous, dark brown/black appearance. The body was capped by a tight, frothy, finger-tall, khaki colored crown that slowly dropped to a thick, clingy, lasting collar. A few droplets of lacing trickled down the glass.. The aroma was insane and reminded me of a liquid Mounds Bar. Chocolate brownie batter notes came through big time. Sweet but not excessively so. Loads of fragrant bourbon as well. Quite boozy. There was an intense vanilla and coconut presence too..  1,560 characters"	4.37
1970	Bourbon Paradise	Dark brown color with a ring of tan foam. Aroma has coconut, booze, whiskey and rum. Taste is sweet with fudge, dark chocolate brownies, bourbon and toffee with a bitter, roasty finish. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. Nice flavors but quite boozy.	4.4
1971	Bourbon Paradise	"Bourbon Paradise - Prairie
BBA Stout - 16% abv. L - trace head atop a pitch black body.. S - smoke, vanilla, chocolate, faint pepper..  333 characters"	4.59
1972	Bourbon Paradise	The beer pours a Pitch Black with a medium sized khaki head. The beer has low carbonation. It smells of coconut, vanilla, whipped cream, marzipans, and a little bourbon. It tastes of toasted coconut, vanilla, egg whites, whipped cream, marzipans, and bourbon. The body is medium full. This is an amazing stout, there are so many coconut stouts these days but this one stood out in a big way.	4.81
1973	Bourbon Paradise	Courtesy of Collins - thanks, bruv!. Aroma of chewy bourbon, vanillin, leather, and toasted oak. Chewy dark malts.. Taste fulfills the promise of the aroma, bringing ample bourbon barrel notes and thick chewy malt..  316 characters	3.35
1974	Bourbon Paradise	Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout aged with coconut and vanilla. Chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow, toasted coconut, Maple syrup, lightly roasted malt, oak and booze. Medium bodied. Fairly bitter finish balances out the sweetness. Very solid and delicious.	4.39
1975	Bourbon Paradise	This is very good, but I scored it a bit lower because of the pure strength of prairie’s other BA offerings such as Pirate Bomb and BA bible belt, which are a lot more impactful than this one. Nice rich fudge base, good strong bourbon barrel bite. The coconut isn’t really coming through too much. The vanilla is in the background.	4.28
1976	Bourbon Paradise	Poured a pitch black color, body appeared a little thin and with no head. Strong aromas of vanilla, toasted coconut and heavy bourbon. In fact, as it warmed up, the bourbon became only stronger and pretty much dominated the nose. The flavors were pretty much spot on: coconut, sweet vanilla and boozy whiskey. It all kind of comes together tasting like chocolate liqueur, a hot boozy dessert. Mouthfeel is fully body and warm, again boozy. Overall: it came in 12 oz. bottles and it should only come in 12 oz. bottles. Finishing it was almost a chore. It was fantastic at first but as it warmed up, it just became a hot mess.	4.06
1977	Bourbon Paradise	"Interesting variant. Many of the things you seek with Prairie imp stouts. Overall a very good sipper with a delightful change of pace flavor wise. The base plus vanilla and coconut created a sum flavor that recalled coconut meringue and subtle vanilla bruelle... then enhanced by the roasty malt and bit of dried figs. The whiskey and wood furthered the complexity. Hints of lime... go figure.
A real standout in an increasingly easy world to get a good BBA Imp Stout.
Very original Beer and speaks worlds of the craftsmanship at Prairie.
Per mine and other previous comments regarding: Prairie pricing...this one is definitely worth the price tag."	4.66
1978	Bourbon Paradise	An absolute monster of a beer; had a bottle over the course of an entire evening (and I mean entire) with a very different experience upon first opening and then a couple hours later.. Coal-black with a khaki head that rose up and slouched forward eventually dissipated into a fine swirl of bubbles.. Aroma is massive and...dark - dark roasted malts, dark fruit, dark ground coffee, dark chocolate. Dark intentions really - this is a beast. Behind it all is surprisingly light vanilla and toasted coconut; had the coconut stood out it would have been a feat worthy of a trophy considering how robust the stout comes through..  1,120 characters	4.42
1979	Bourbon Paradise	Beer pours a Black! With no head. The smell is bourbon which is why the smell is the lowest rating. The taste is spectaculor plain and simple. Butterscotch is what hits and the bourbon doesn't mess up the swallow. Nice and smooth overall a fantastic beer!!!!!!!!!!!	4.39
1980	Bourbon Paradise	i wasnt the biggest fan of the original paradise, way too sweet and way too much vanilla, just totally over the top, comical proportions really, purely novelty sort of brew, at least for me, but this special barrel aged version improves it considerably i reckon, with the coconut really coming out, enhanced by the sweet whiskey and charred oak. i also get a lot more of the roasted grain character than i ever did in the base beer by itself, bitter with some coffee essence, rich still and absolutely sugary, even splitting a small bottle of this felt like a ton of beer, with the alcohol and the sugar just dripping out of it. cool nuance here, not all vanilla, some light smoke, some wet oak, good bourbon and charcoal, milk chocolate desserty vibes, and dried fruits like raisins and figs. the coconut is floral and new and nice, toasted and baked tasting, awesome with the vanilla, which tastes less syrupy and more natural here than it did in the original, owing to the barrel i reckon. huge body and a ton of booze, this is sludgy and thick and viscous to the max, but it lets all the flavors slowly and semi permanently coat the palate, and its pretty agreeable to me overall. maybe not quite worthy as one of the top beers in the world, that seems like a stretch for it, but a special treat nevertheless and another cool one from prairie. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing this one with me, a rarity indeed! diabetic but delicious.	4.45
1981	Bourbon Paradise	12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had 12/26/17.. Pours a mostly opaque dark brown, oily looking, with a quarter inch quickly dissipating head and light soapy lacing. Smells incredible- bourbon, malt, cocoa, vanilla, raisins, toffee, some coconut- more as it warms, oak, figs, molasses, light tobacco, a hint of mustard. The taste is more bourbon forward, then coconut, caramel, cocoa, chocolate, malt, figs, oak, less vanilla than the nose, light molasses, faint maple. Only a hint of alcohol, which is amazing for the ABV. Incredibly smooth, again, for the ABV, a great full body, appropriately carbonated.. The bourbon and vanilla are terrific, the coconut stands tall. Well balanced between the bourbon and the base beer. Really enjoyable and well worth a purchase, even at the higher price point. Yum.	4.58
1982	Bourbon Paradise	"L: jet black, thin quickly receding tan head leaving a faint ring
S: I get the smell of nuts (almonds or pecans) which I know don't go into this beer but that's what I smell. Vanilla is also noticeable
T: sweet, but not overly sweet. Heavy vanilla, but the coconut is present. Love how these work together to make a sweet stout that doesn't have the heavy roasty flavors (coffee, cocoa, toast, etc)
F: a touch thin and a bit too fizzy. Not a huge fan of how it feels
O: an interesting pastry stout that I don't get tired of. Good blend of flavors without having any one thing dominate. Quite enjoyable"	4.38
1983	Bourbon Paradise	12 oz bottle poured into a teku. A- Black with a two finger fast fading mocha head. S- Bourbon, barker’s chocolate, coconut, some vanilla, dark fruits, some fudge..  385 characters	4.8
1984	Saint Lamvinus	Bottle from Toby at de Garde anniversary event. Ruby colored pour, light pink head. Sweet, funky aroma. Grape-y taste, yeasty funk, medium tart. Hits all the right marks.	4.28
1985	Saint Lamvinus	2013 vintage; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Opaque pink/purple appearance.. Minimal off-white head; no lace..  344 characters	4.5
1986	Saint Lamvinus	Shared bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm.. Pours a deep red with soft, pink foam.. Smell is funky and vinous, with notes of red grapes, raspberries and a hint of manure..  451 characters	4.35
1987	Saint Lamvinus	Cantillon Saint Lamvinus, 7% ABV. Pours a beautiful deep red, with a one finger pinkish head that dissipated while I got a good picture, leaving no lacing. Nose is light grape and wine. Taste is dry wine with some tartness, and not much bitterness or funk. Feel is decent, good carbonation and dry. Overall excellent. I know this is highly rated, but I'm not loving it.	4.1
1988	Saint Lamvinus	"Between wine and beer, this one is the least funky brew I've had from Cantillon. Pungeant notes of merlot are present. The lambic is present to balance the whole but never dominates the beverage.
Quite unique. Perfectly mastered.. More and more I drink this beer (I've had multiple times from a bottle) more I love it. Just sublime."	4.96
1989	Saint Lamvinus	Had this outside and it had a striking bright red color with a wispy pink head. Aroma was fresh cherries mixed with barnyard funk. The taste featured slightly tart cherries with red grapes, hay, leather, some bleu cheese, and funk. A nice long red-wine finish. Light-to-medium bodied and extremely easy to drink.	4.53
1990	Saint Lamvinus	This is indeed a great Belgian Lambic. It might be the best Lambic I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't easy to get in the states.. Look: semi-clear red with a brown tint and a half inch white slightly pinkish head. The color is very vivid and it looks beautiful.. Aroma: grapes, cherry, red wine.  624 characters	4.71
1991	Saint Lamvinus	"Earthy, wonderfully tart and lightly sour, funky - beautiful pour, lightly effervescent and carbonated. The grapes are pungent and rich in the mouth.. This bottle was a complete surprise at a friend's share - I hadn't even recalled this was on my wish list. It's a great pleasure to tick this one - I think that Fou Foune may still be my ""regular"" favorite, but St. Lam is tremendous."	4.68
1992	Saint Lamvinus	09/2013 - always a consistently elegant, complex, and just damn delicious lambic; the grape pops everywhere, classic cheesy funk; dope as fuck from beginning through the finish, no matter the vintage.	4.71
1993	Saint Lamvinus	Poured a non-translucent light purple color - almost like diluted grape juice. Very little head on presentation. The smell is tart, dry and vinous with a whiff of grape skins and oak. Some funk pushing through in the nose. The taste is so balanced and easy to drink. It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version. It does have a nice vinous quality which I assume are from the Merlot grapes.	4.62
1994	Saint Lamvinus	Soft ripe exotic grape creamy with enough lactic but not too much not yogurt level. Next level blending skills or just right in my wheelhouse. Absolutely reccomend if given the chance to try. Possibly a touch above Fou?	4.59
1995	Saint Lamvinus	One of the best Cantillon beers I’ve tried. 2016 bottle poured into a stemmed bulb. Pours hazy and pulpy plum purple color. Beautiful color. Aromas of earthy grape and funk. Taste is amazing. The grapes used in this are so unique and just taste so amazing. Earthiness, funk and some hints of red wine. Feel is thick for this style. Drinks with some body. Overall, this is an amazing Lambic and one of the best I’ve had.	4.77
1996	Saint Lamvinus	"Look: Clear Purple with medium pink fizzy head that recedes immediately. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Merlot grapes, oak, tart, and cherries.
Taste: Tart, merlot grapes, oak, and a little funk.
Mouthfeel: Light and delicate.
Overall: A good lambic from Cantillon, but I don’t think this lives up to the hype or the price tag."	4.42
1997	Saint Lamvinus	"Look: thick 1.5 purple red head, color is a clear blood red
Smell: beautiful crisp funk, some oak, cherry and a very powerful merlot.
Taste: clean tart sour is the first impression, as it settles you get oak and a ton of grape
Feel: chewy like a big thick mouth feel and body, medium carbonation and finishes semi dry.. Overall: a very solid merlot based lambic."	4.47
1998	Saint Lamvinus	Pours a cloudy burgundy with a thin almost pinkish white ring of foam around the edge. The nose is not stellar in this beer. Strong barnyard, but not pleasant like other cantillon beers. A bit vinegary and only hints of the vine. The taste is altogether different from the nose. Very balanced with an ultra sweet middle, mild funk, and clean dry finish. Not really vinous in flavor, more grapeish. Feel is light and effervescent. Overall this beer scares you when you take a whiff but it unexpectedly lives up to the hype in the flavor which has no bearing to the smell. There is a little bit of wine in the nose but approaches more grape.	4.22
1999	Saint Lamvinus	I have had several vintages of this and I must say I like it more young. The wine is not overbearing but provides a brightness that is just wonderful. Dark fruit on the nose and palate. Some funk, but not overbearing. It was more like blackberry or jam than wine but this was tasty.	4.63
2000	Saint Lamvinus	5800th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/14/2016. Listed at 7% on the label. Cork was wet under the cap, and almost fell apart removing it. Pours lightly hazy ruby reddish orange/pink/purple color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of complexity of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness; light fruit tang and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, cracker, light leather/funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from tartness and tangy/tannic fruit/oak. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an excellent fruit lambic. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly lactic/tangy/tannic/drying finish. Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this. Not as much depth in funky complexity, and not as jammy/vinous on fruit character as I wanted. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example otherwise.	4
2001	Saint Lamvinus	Split with Goblinmunkey7 on 8/8/17, review from notes. A: Deep amber with some red and purple at the core - hazy - pours with a medium size, off-white/pink head, fades to a wispy cap, retains a small collar, leaves some streaks of lacing. S: Wonderfully sour in a distinctly Cantillon way - sharp and bright, acidic - tart with an awesome amount of funk - some lactic dampness - nicely woody, sharp oak - nice grape aroma, ripe yet gentle grape flesh - light sweetness.  1,147 characters	4.53
2002	Saint Lamvinus	Plum purple with a small purple-tinted head that quickly forms a bubbly crown. Light Merlot and barnyard funk in the nose. Delicate fruity taste: cherry, grape, red wine. Modest sourness midpalate. Nice acidic wine barrel finish. Relatively light bodied with low carbonation. Delicious.	4.2
2003	Saint Lamvinus	2016 vintage poured from fridge temp but allowed to warm. Pours a ruby pinkish color with surprisingly little carbonation. Cork was a bit deformed and seemed very wet. Smell is out of this world. Vanilla, red grapes, apricot, sour, scrumptious. I get some sweet candy on the nose as well. Taste is amazing - quite a departure from the nose. A quick bitterness springs forward on first taste, but then settles with a sweet finish. The sour isn't overwhelming. Definitely getting grapes, cherries, apricot. Such a nice balance and has amazing mouthfeel. Not too thick, but lingers. Overall, an amazing beer.	4.4
2004	Saint Lamvinus	A 750ml bottle, bottled on 14th November 2016. Poured into a wine glass.. Appearance: It was a very nice lightly cloudy ruby red colour with a two finger pinkish head that dissipated fairly quickly to a settled thin layer with only sparse lacing.. Aroma: Lots of tart red berries, raspberry and strawberry plus grapes and lemon. Nice barrel and oak character with a hint of red wine vinegar and only light funk and barnyard-iness..  888 characters	4.65
2005	Saint Lamvinus	"**
06/11/17. Cinder. Bright Red/purple. Medium white head that lasts.
AROMA: wine, grape, yeast,cranberry raspberry.
TASTE: sour cranberry, wheat, yeast.
FEEL: touch of astringency, but Smooth for a sour. Subtle carbonation..  233 characters"	3.31

Aroma has red grapes, sweet red berries, little funk, little sour.
Taste is red grapes, hay, sweet red berries, lemon, tart, melon, little sour and dry finish.

L: 4.5 S: 4.5 T: 4.75 F: 4.5 O: 4.75"	4.31
2007	Saint Lamvinus	A - Stunning ruby red with a very light pink head which dissipated quickly but held at about 2-3mm.. S - Got some sweet dark fruit aromas (raspberries, plums and grapes) and some subtle funk.. T - Really well balanced sourness, funk and fruit. Dark grape flavours drove the palate..  559 characters	4.59
2008	Saint Lamvinus	Hazy garnet with a soft white, but slightly pink collar.. Funky aroma of brie cheese, light red wine vinegar, and merlot.. Lots of grape in flavor, but also lemon-lime, grapefruit, and brine. Raspberry develops as it warms. It's a little lactic, but overall more acetic, yet it's balanced and very well-made, as I'm not getting any hint of impending acid reflux whatsoever..  451 characters	4.03
2009	Keene Idea	16oz can, dated 08.05.19, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 08.25.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a super hazy orange color, amber hues, super turbid with a foamy finger of white head that has minimal retention but decent lacing. The aroma is very nice, crazy dank and grassy, raw green hop leaf, hop spice, lots of piney resin and some herbal tea brings forward a more floral and citrusy character, tons of bitter grapefruit peel with a bit of underlying tropical fruit and soft pale dough. The flavors are in line with the nose, toeing the line between dank and juicy, grassy, raw green hop, light spice, resinous pine, pineapple, citrus peel, mango and peach with a bit of warming booze and soft dough. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick with a heavier body that's lively and punchy and finishes with a warm and dry boozy finish.. Verdict: A super good IIPA from Alpine. It's big, it's intense, it's about as hoppy as one can get but that 8.88% ABV is definitely there. Definitely a top IPA from Alpine, who already have a great lineup of worthy beers.	4.33
2010	Keene Idea	Finally was able to track this one down thanks to good beer friends! Definitely one of Alpines best! Nice citrus notes and a solid hoppy finish. Enjoyed the 64 oz growler with friends at a Bachelor party share.	4.66
2011	Keene Idea	fresh growler drank on 8/3/2017. exploding carbonation but this is a really well done DIPA. Balanced bitterness, with complex hop flavors...ripe lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, earthy, and dank...hoping they bottle this so I can try again	4.5
2012	Keene Idea	Love the hops in this one, which is easily one of Alpine's best. The only bad thing about Keene Idea is that they (to my knowledge) haven't bottled it yet. I would stock up like crazy!	4.57
2013	Keene Idea	This beer is awesome, wish they would bottle it so I could have it all the time. Loved this beer and going to Alpine is a great brewery to visit. The nicest guys ever there. Looking forward to this being released again	4.75
2014	Keene Idea	Stone fruit and juiciness on the nose give way to grapefruit citrus flavor and some dank , with slight bitterness. One of best DIPAs I've had and Alpine's best IMO	4.64
2015	Keene Idea	Had on Tap at Hopocalyse Day 1/23/16. A: Golden to almost orange hue. good creamy white bubbles. S: some resin, hops, citrus, some slight guava..  286 characters	4.31
2016	Keene Idea	From growler. Pours a slightly hazy copper orange. Multi finger foam head with reasonable retention. Solid lacing. Smells of good, clean, hop fun. Bitter and earthy smell. A nice, more simple, great tasting beer. Bitter pine that makes way to a hint of fresh grapefruit. Smooth feel with strong carbonation and an assertive hop stick. Best ipa I've tried from these guys, thus far.	4.59
2017	Keene Idea	Pours a burnt orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some throughout drinking. Solid lacing on the glass. Nice tropical smell on the nose with some of the nelson character as well. Taste reflects that soft citrus flavor with nice bitterness shining through. Great, smooth mouthfeel that you look for with the upper echelon IPA class. Best IPA offering from these guys in my opinion	4.58
2018	Keene Idea	Just had the Keene Idea for the first time today.. Went to get Nelsons.. Now I want Keene Idea.. The same Nelson Hops used here. Little more Boozy than the Nelson but still so so drinkable and absolutely my new best from Alpine !	4.98
2019	Keene Idea	Poured from 64oz growler into tulp crystal clear orange in color with white head that vanished quickly. (I believe because i didnt get to open it soon enough) smells of tropical fruit, pineapple and citrus. Ice lacing and great tasting beer at a 8.8%. Piney and hoppy! Would like to get some bottle to beable to get the full flavor. Im a Nelson guy myself but another great IPA from Alpine	4.43
2020	Keene Idea	32oz ABC growler, served in a snifter glass 9/30/2015.. Pours a lighter orange-copper body, clear with a remarkable amount of clarity; two finger white head with fair retention (given the growler serving) and very nice lacing. Looks like a West Coaster through and through. Smells of tropical fruit, dank durian fruit, pineapple, rich caramel malt, slight herbal character, a mild amount of spices to it. Deliciously balanced nose. Flavour is similarly excellent; rich tropical fruit, a bit of ripe pineapple and durian fruit, slightly funky and spicy, backed up by a rich caramel malt that is bold but not to the point of cloying or barleywine levels. Makes for a very balanced, complex and rich double IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, substantial, slightly slick and sticky but incredibly drinkable. Very mild heat to it. Overall, a very rich double IPA with a lot of interesting spicy and tropical fruit character to it. This is awesome.	4.49
2021	Keene Idea	Deep copper color with a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is piney and honey sweet. I taste a massive amount of piney hops. The mouth is thick, chewy, and overall dense.	4.15
2022	Keene Idea	Very nice aroma and blend of hops, remarkably smooth for a 9%. The higher alcohol content is not very noticeable, but can be noticeable if you let it warm up, so definitely drink it chilled. This is probably my favorite IPA by Alpine with bad boy a close second.	4.68
2023	Keene Idea	64 oz. growler poured into a snifter.. Appearance - Clear golden body. Nice white head. Some lacing and decent retention.. Smell - Strong Nelson hops. Orange and a hint of herbal character. Sweet pale malts..  478 characters	4.2
2024	Keene Idea	Pours and orange hazy color with moderate head retention. Smells very citrusy with some mango notes. Tastes a lot of grapefruit with this beer with a moderate bitter finish. Moderate mouth feel with perfect carbonation for this beer. Another excellent Alpine offering.	4.72
2025	Keene Idea	Not quite as good as Bad Boy, but different and special in its own way. Another example of the great SoCal IPAs that have a lot of hops but still make them drinkable and enjoyable.	4.6
2026	Keene Idea	The one and only time I've made the pilgrimage to Alpine Beer, this was on tap. I had no idea what it was and in hindsight I consider myself a lucky man for being able to drink a pint of this my first time there. I will absolutely be on the lookout for when they tap it again. Absolutely incredible IPA.	4.91
2027	Keene Idea	This is like Nelson on crack. So delicious. Barely noticeable ABV. One Alpine beer you know you're getting from their production and not Green Flash. Must try. Another winner from Alpine.	4.8
2028	Keene Idea	Like liquid hop candy, yet with a basic enough malt base to never veer off into syrupy sweet territory. Arguably the best beer Alpine puts out, and that's saying something.	4.65
2029	Keene Idea	So freaking good! Not as good as Bad Boy but the dry hop on this beer is so amazing. Has that cloudy ipa look that I love and it so smooth and drinkable. I wish I could have a tap of this straight from Alpine in my house.	4.81
2030	Keene Idea	Alpine's litmus test to me involved having Keene Idea (originally Toronado's 25th Anniversary beer) on a beer list already with outstanding beers. I prefer not to use tasters because I like to soak up a greater experience with a given beer, so after a round a Nelson, Keene Idea had a high mark to hit. On to the beer:. This beer is light orange colored and topped with a short head with solid retention on top. I took a smell of the beer, and at that moment I was assured by the USDA that I had consumed my daily requirement of fruit, as this beer is big on fruit! A smash to the head with passionfruit, followed closely by succulent guava, cantaloupe and mango.. There's no way that a stablemate of Nelson can be better tasting, could it? At times, I thought that Keene Idea had climbed Mount Everest to be with Nelson. While overall it doesn't quite hit that stratospheric peak, Keene Idea is undoubtedly outstanding beer. The beer is not bitter, yet full of hoppiness and more. The tastes of orange, passionfruit, and guava are unashamedly fantastic, and that alcohol level does not cross the palate immediately, further making my pint dangerously drinkable. It's full bodied and very smooth, and already being such a great beer, felt that this beer was not playing fair..  1,380 characters	4.6
2031	Keene Idea	"Type: Draft
Glass: Pint glass
From: Alpine Beer Company in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $6.00
Purchased: Oct. 12, 2014
Consumed: Oct. 12, 2014
Misc.: N/A. Poured a honey, caramel, hazy color with one finger of off white head when I got it. Good foamy spiderweb lacing along the sides of the glass. Average retention on the top all the way down. NOTE: Mine was a bit flat and I used the guy’s glass next to me. I went with somewhere in between the ratings. (Sight - 3.75). Smelled sharp grapefruit juice, Citra hops, floral hops, orange, tangerine rind, nectarine, caramel, honey and light spicy Simcoe hops. (Smell - 4.75).  1,091 characters"	4.59
2032	Keene Idea	On tap at Alpine:. A: Hazy light orange with a small bright white head that recedes to a small ring around the glass. Small specks of lacing persist on the glass.. S: Big notes of orange zest, mango, and pineapple upfront. A hint of sweet malt and some grassy and floral hops..  515 characters	4.49
2033	Keene Idea	On draft at the Alpine Pub. Pours a hazy straw color, the flavor is pure Nelson on steroids, with that classic dry/white grape finish. My favorite beer from Alpine so that's saying something :)	5
2034	V.S.O.J.	Tasted from can. Thick and chewy. Sticky goodness. Lots of bourbon, caramel and molasses on aroma and taste. Some dark fruits, raisins, dates, brown sugar and maple along with the caramel molasses on taste. Incredible English barleywine.	4.78
2035	V.S.O.J.	Thanks to intecwrx for this 12 oz. can. My very special old jacket was my first black leather motorcycle jacket, which protected me from my first motorcycle crash. It looked bad ass with those skid marks across the right shoulder. My shoulder, not so much.. The pour is very dark brown with Shanda Fay highlights. Nose is surprisingly weak – or is that subtle – with dark fruit & what I’d assume was brandy if I couldn’t read.. V.S.O.J. How is this not brandy barrel aged? Because that’s what I get: rich alcohol, dark, fleshy fruit, caramel, brown sugar, sharp oak, molasses, damn there’s a lot going on in here. Sticky, denser than Michael A****** (name redacted). Like Fay, once in a night is enough..  894 characters	4.13
2036	V.S.O.J.	Bourbon, toffee, brown sugar, charred oak, raisins, fig, leather, subtle rye and faint cocoa. This beer delivers on all cylinders despite a slightly sulfurous aroma.	4.36
2037	V.S.O.J.	The finest example of the style I've had since King Henry. This beer was a true delight and I'd recommend it to anyone. Well worth the effort to find one of these gems. The barrel flavor and mouthfeel on this beer was incredible.	4.98
2038	V.S.O.J.	I'm not particularly a fan of barleywines or Straightjacket for that matter, but I got to try this at a share recently and I fully understand why it is a favorite and top-rated beer!!! Absolutely amazingly smooth. I wouldn't change a thing about this. Outstanding! I will search this one out in the future for sure	4.86
2039	V.S.O.J.	Pours an almost entirely opaque brown with tinges of light coming through at the edges, with a big, light tan head that dissipates slowly.. Aromas of dark fruits, leather, raisins, slightly dried prunes, fig, caramel, and toffee dominate. Subtle undertones of vanilla, oak, brown sugar, cocoa, and coffee follow. All the immense complexity that one would hope for in an English Barleywine is present, and then there's an extra step above in every aspect! Only a slightly over the top boozy aroma keeps this from being perfect, and even that isn't unwelcome. Truly delightful!. The taste is more of the same. Deep complexity, with rich dark fruits, leather, cocoa powder, vanilla, and oak playing the most prominent roles. Toffee and molasses also are big players here, and there's a hint of coffee as well..  1,210 characters	4.64
2040	V.S.O.J.	2018 vintage tasted in a snifter from draft at O'Toole's on February 5, 2019. A celebration of malt, oak and patience. Very Special Old [Straight] Jacket is a cuvée of English barleywines each aged between two and three years in bourbon barrels. Lusciously sweet and colossally complex, V.S.O.J. is equal parts refinement and excess.	4.57
2041	V.S.O.J.	12 oz can poured into a tulip. Appearance was a little off putting as this was very dark brown. Not the color I'm used to from a typical barley wine. Small off-white head that dissipated quick. Aroma was off the charts....lots of barrel character such as bourbon and wood. Dark fruit was heavily present. Lots of fig, raisin and prune and a hint of tobacco. Flavor was everything I detected in the aroma. Tons of fig, raisin and prune...lots of bourbon and oak. Very rich. Feel was medium bodied. Kinda stout like which is thicker for a barley wine. Overall, this was fantastic. A real treat to have. Glad to have been able to try.	4.6
2042	V.S.O.J.	12/2018 - This is just so damn good - caramel and toffee, negligible booze, awesome bourbon though; great mouthfeel, which lingers through the finish. This is a super sipper!	4.5
2043	V.S.O.J.	2018 release.. A: Pours a nearly-black brown color with basically no head. No retention. Some nice effervescence.. S: Dried black currants, rich sweet toffee, a backdrop of bourbon, and a bit of dark cocoa powder. Not the most aromatic, but the aromas work together..  740 characters	4.34
2044	V.S.O.J.	Shocked to say that I agree with the hype on this. An absolutely perfectly executed English barleywine and wow, this is wonderful. Notes of vanilla and charred oak from the barrel combine with fig, plum, caramel, toffee, maplely brown sugar, and a little cocoa. Many of those flavors I don’t particularly go for. Wow. Incredible	4.75
2045	V.S.O.J.	Probably the best barleywine I will ever have and one of my all time favorite beers. It's so rich and decadent. Pours a dark brown with hues of red. Smells like caramel, toffee, and bourbon all mixed together. Tastes amazing. Complex flavors last a long time and change as the beer warms up. Really goes to show what a great barrel program Rev has going.	4.99
2046	V.S.O.J.	The best got even better. I love regular Straight Jacket and I could drink it every day, but I never have enough. This is like regular SJ on steroids and HGH. Everything that is awesome about SJ but even better. More intense flavor but also more nuance, depth and complexity. I'd even say that this is better than HF Aaron. Best English barleywine I've ever had bar none. Barleywine is life.	5
2047	V.S.O.J.	Head and shoulders above VSOD - VSOJ is like Straight Jacket cranked up to 11.. VSOJ is tremendously sweet - loads of raisin and caramel and just a bit of dry barrel to keep it grounded. It's delicious even when cold, and then opens up to further taste definition of the caramel and raisins. Barrels are excellent.. Exceptionally good beer - probably Revolution's best thus far, with the possible exception of Coffee Deth's Tar.	4.6
2048	V.S.O.J.	Nearly appearing like a stout, this has a dark brown to blackish body with faint red edges under a creamy, uneven khaki blanket that fades to a thick bubbly ring. A swirl leaves wide, clear legs drooping over the surface forever.. Smell is deeply charred oak with sticky mapled brown sugar coconut oatmeal. What? Cedary pepper accents hints of prune and raisin before ashey milk chocolate deepens the aroma.. Taste starts sweet and transitions into rich and intensely dark charred oak that has an almost smoky note of maple. An addition of dark fruit character is mild as the tingly, microscopically effervescent swallow brings forward milk chocolate and Tootsie Roll with darkly crystallized caramel coming out in the exhale..  1,016 characters	4.9
2049	V.S.O.J.	Straight 5's here, this beer is absolutely outstanding! I honestly don't know how you could improve on this. Massive barrel, caramelized sugar/fig/vanilla flavor.	5
2050	V.S.O.J.	10/17/18 (Chicago): $6.82 5 ounce sample pour into snifter at the Revolution release event held at the brewpub. 2018 release 13.8% ABV. Dark black amber pour, very nice aroma, bourbon, vanilla, wine, on the sweet side. Very smooth whiskey malt taste, vanilla as well, very well balanced. Extremely smooth and creamy mouth feel, very easy drinking. Overall excellent pour, outstanding!. Brewer notes for this version: A cuvee of English Barleywines aged between two and three years in our favorite bourbon barrels. Very Special Old [Straight] Jacket is a luscious, complex celebration of malt, oak, and patience.	4.51
2051	V.S.O.J.	"L: Pours a lustrous stream of dark chestnut and mahogany, which is met by a gracious 1cm tan head
S: Cognac, vanilla beans, toffee, and figs on the nose
T: Wow - incredibly complex profile that starts with oatmeal raisin cookies, fig newtons, and caramel and finishes with a grade B maple syrup, boozy roasted malt, and bourbon combination
F: Thick, creamy, and rich with a moderate carb
O: Decadent and full octane barleywine - bold flavors expertly combined with a skillfully crafted extended barrel aging. Easily one of the best barleywines I've had in recent memory."	4.82
2052	V.S.O.J.	2018 Can. A: huge boozy flavors, tons of raisin and vanilla, toasted oak, rum and whisky, fig, prune, and caramel. A: very dark brown to black with shallow head that falls to a nice tan lacing.  487 characters	4.48
2053	V.S.O.J.	On draft at Revolution. Full pour.. Rich barrel notes and so much caramel flavor. The difference between straight jacket and VSOJ is crazy. This is just as good as King Henry and Voodoo K-13 which are some of the finest barrel aged English Barleywines this world has to offer.	4.74
2054	V.S.O.J.	12oz can, snifter glass. Dark caramel brown body, one finger offwhite head, good retention, plenty of lacing. Looks like liquid butterscotch, opaque. Smell is massive bourbon and vanilla, a veritable depth charge of caramel, butterscotch, oak, vanillin, toffee to go along with a dose of sweet oaky whiskey. Damn. Flavour is a massive coalescence of all of the aforementioned aromas; it's literally everything you could ever want in a barleywine and amplified to 11. Yes, this one goes to 11. Mouthfeel is medium fuller bodied, lighter carbonation, smooth as silk, warming heat on the backend. It's delicious and massive. It brings all the boys to the yard, this one.	4.7
2055	V.S.O.J.	Tasted on draft two nights ago at a preview party, reviewing now from a can. Half a finger of quickly dissipating head over a thick caramel beer. Minimal lacing, thick legs when swirled. Brown sugar, leather, plum, rum-soaked Christmas cake on the nose. Boozy bourbon spice and vanilla enter on the palate, with port wine and candy apple. Just near the edge of syrupy in terms of thickness; mouth-coating but not a sugar bomb, thanks to ample bourbon heat. Absolutely world class.	4.68
2056	V.S.O.J.	Canned 10/10/18; drank 10/19/18 @ the Yarchives.. Brown/black appearance.. A violent pour yielded a small tan head; nice lace..  436 characters	4.94
2057	V.S.O.J.	Everything I loved for years about Straight Jacket was made even better and more complex in V.S.O.J. In a year where Revolution brought their A-game in the deep wood series, V.S.O.J. stood out from the rest! The booze and wood mingling with the barley and sweet dark fruit seemed destined for each other. Somewhat syrupy in the texture, but thick and richly so.	4.75
2058	V.S.O.J.	6oz pour on tap at the Revolution Production Facility on Kedzie, poured into a mini cervoise.. The beer pours a very dark burgundy color, cola brown hues that is nearly black without much head, nor retention and no lace. The aroma is excellent beautiful barrel character, tons of oak, rich bourbon, smooth caramel, lightly charred wood, tons of brown sugar, molasses and stone fruits with lingering rich grain. The flavors are immense, tons of barrel, brown sugar, caramel, rich grain, stone fruit, toffee, light chocolate, excellent bourbon character, lightly charred wood, mild roast, a hint of spice, beautiful depth of flavor. The mouthfeel is great, coating, heavy full body, soft and gentle with a warm and creamy finish.. Verdict: An amazing barleywine from Revolution. Just incredible depth of flavor, so complex but so well balanced, a world class barleywine for sure.	4.77
2059	Flora Plum	Batch #3, drank on 7/6/2019. Quite sour, excellent plum. Beautiful, thick pour.. Batch #4, drank on 7/14/2019. Dry and excellent plum flesh. Zero funk. Tart. Super good. A bit more transparent than batch #3.	4.73
2060	Flora Plum	Beautiful, light pink/purple color. Medium carb and light feel. Full flavor with sweet plum and some lemon flavor. Really easy to drink, refreshing and hard to put down. Outstanding	4.92
2061	Flora Plum	Hill Farmstead Flora Plum. I’ve been very excited to try this beer courtesy of. By way of background I’ve never had a fruited beer from Hill Farmstead beer, and I’ve never had the base beer, Florence..  1,818 characters	4.32
2062	Flora Plum	insanely tart and funky, bright acidity, lemon, white grape, ripe ripe berry quality, hay, oak, barnyard character, spicy pepper note, just really complex funky sour qualities. its aggressive but so perfectly executed.	5
2063	Flora Plum	2018 release.. A: Pours a very light pale, hazy, kind of berliner-like, with a cap of bright white head which quickly fizzles out to a sharp ring. Nicely effervescent. Minimal retention and no lacing.. S: Moderate sour plum and grainy wheat, hefty amount of barnyard funk and a hint of spice..  602 characters	4.44
2064	Flora Plum	03/2016 - I want to like this more but the nose is just unpleasant to me - it smells like plastic, basically. Thankfully, the palate is chock full of plum, nice oakiness, juicy fruit, with a touch of tartness in back; the finish is creamy, tart, and has a solid acidity.	3.97
2065	Flora Plum	Poured from a 375mL bottle into a HF bulb. Batch 2. Thanks Ryan for sharing this.. Pours a pinkish-purple hazy body with a one finger frothy head. Doesn't leave much lacing or retention.. Aromas are out of this world, nearly a 5 in this category - straight fresh plums and stone fruit, candied plum, tart lactic, light funk..  668 characters	4.74
2066	Flora Plum	375 ml bottle poured into a teku at a share.. Pours slightly golden with a pinkish hue. Minimal head that dissipates quick. No lacing down the side. Champagne like bubbles.. Aroma is funk, tartness and sweet plums. Smells absolutely fantastic..  588 characters	4.71
2067	Flora Plum	This is probably the best Hill Farmstead beer ive had. It takes Floras great base beer and blends perfectly with the plums to create a something amazing. Id drink one of these a day if i could, it was that good.	5
2068	Flora Plum	I had the great fortune of sharing a bottle of Flora Plum with a close friend when visiting Cape Cod in the summer of 2018. Quite possibly the best sour I've had. Beautiful color and such delicate flavors, worth the money (which was substantial, I think this was the most expensive glass of beer I've been lucky enough to enjoy), truly spectacular.	5
2069	Flora Plum	Batch 1: Bright gold pour, light haze, smaller head that fizzles out fast. amazing balance in the aroma and taste here. Slightly under-ripe yellow plum, rustic notes, wheat, barnyard funk, lemon notes, lighter oak notes, light vanilla sweetness, light yogurt lactic sourness. Nothing here exhausts the palate - no one component completely takes over this beer. Lighter body, carbonation is spot on.	4.63
2070	Flora Plum	Received in a trade, shared with JLindros.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice clear light honey golden hue with a thin head that fades to leave light wisps.. S - Aromas of typical funky flora type saison. Light wine notes, fair amount of mineral notes, not much plum..  617 characters	4.25
2071	Flora Plum	Bottled 1/12/2016. Pours a pale, hazy yellow with a tight white band around the shoulders. Nose expresses citrus, plum skins and a hint of spice. Not too much happening in the flavor department - must with a little citrus. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild carbonation and light acidity. Overall, solid; however, not much fruit is evident.	4.01
2072	Flora Plum	Bottle shared with Jon and Paul.. Sunshine yellow body, moderately hazy, small white collar. Aromas of brett, oak, wine, white grape. Plum character emerges more so in the flavor than the nose. Light and piquant. The finish brings sweet tart candies with a mild acetic note. Outstanding.	4.5
2073	Flora Plum	Batch 2 drank in a HF tulip on 10/7/2016. Look-hazy light tan with a hint of pink. Well carbonated but the head fades quickly.. Smell-fruity, tart, oaky, funky.  477 characters	4.63
2074	Flora Plum	Flora Plum batch 2. Pours a hazed peach pulp colored beer with a dense, stable head to it.. Has a floral barnyard characteristic on the nose, consisting of wet hay, wild flowers, fresh plugged mushrooms, lemon pulp, leather and in this case fruity, sour plums. The plums got an awesomly intriguing appearance on the nose, with a soft stone quality coming through, together with a sweeter note, resulting from the plum skin..  1,183 characters	3.81
2075	Flora Plum	Juicy ripe plums picked and appropriately timed to perfection in this beer. Incredible nectar and plenty of gleeky-sourness to it without the harsh finish, very smooth on the way down. This is hands down one of the very best fruited saisons I've ever had the pleasure to try. The pour is a hazy yellow trillium ipa with minimal lacing around the edge of the glass. Aroma is intense with fruit, something unique about the funk... it's not overwhelming but reminds me for some reason of a Russian River sour. The way the sweetness lingers through the finish and the smooth mouthfeel ends with no puckering, this thing is awesome.	4.63
2076	Flora Plum	Bottle shared by Curran on my wedding day- thanks a ton man.. This pours a hazy orange-ish color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing.. Smells like tart and super juicy plum, with lots of oak, a little bit of citrusy funk, and plum skin..  670 characters	4.64
2077	Flora Plum	My first HF Flora variant. And while I'm admittedly not that big into plums, I still found this to be an enjoyable brew. I'm glad I had this during summer, it was very refreshing.	4.19
2078	Flora Plum	This is head and shoulders above the other Flora variants and among HF's best saisons. Had both batches at a recent tasting. Both are excellent, but batch 1 had a flavor that had burned in and integrated, and a bit more funk that put it over the top. Seek out.	4.74
2079	Flora Plum	Well balanced fruited wild ale. The beer is a vehicle for the plum. I miss some of the nuance of Flora as the base beer takes a backseat to the tartness and acidity of fresh plum. The mouthfeel draws character from the plum skin with a finishing dryness and crisp tartness. The flavors harmonize as they warm slightly with a fuller plum flesh flavor and aroma. Very nice expression of fresh plums.	4.47
2080	Flora Plum	Batch 1. Super hazy yellow color with a rush of head when the bottle was opened. The nose is plum and earthy, but somewhat muted. Taste is a very full plum / sour taste. Feel is very juicy and feeling, just overwhelms you in a good way. Overall this is a fantastic beer.	4.62
2081	Flora Plum	Traded for this a while ago and was waiting for the right moment to enjoy it peacefully by myself....that happened last night and it was outstanding! Light tart, light plum fruit notes but decent fruit character! Extremely drinkable and refreshing and I would love to get more! Excellent fruited offering by HF!	4.53
2082	Flora Plum	Batch 2, poured into a taster. Tart with a mild funk, the plum shines through nicely and is incorporated well with a bit of white wine barrel. Good, crisp carbination. Well done.	4.42
2083	Flora Plum	Murky peach color. Aroma has lots of fruits like quince, plum, apricot, pear and some lambic style funk but quite clean overall. Taste follows with the same fruits I got on the aroma. Not overly sour but it has a good amount of fruit acidity. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. A really well done sour fruit beer resembling the lambic style.	4.5
2084	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Pours a mango-orange with a murky transparency and a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation. It's big and flavorful, which is welcome in a beer. It combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined, but well-worn and knowledgeable, experience.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 16oz can.	4.39
2085	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Classic hazy, opaque, and nearly pulpy New England look; mango-orange body. Strong head production, with about a finger and a half of off-white foam from a gentle pour. Retention is solid.. Aroma is just bursting with hops: bright herbs (mint, oregano, basil), waves of citrus (mandarin orange, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit), tropical fruit (melon, mango, strawberry, peach), and a honey cracker malt base beneath it all.. Brew delivers the same character to the palate. There's a chewy, grainy, crackery malt bill in the background, reminding you this is an APA, while still allowing the hop character to shine. Bright, minty herbs; biting citrus; mild pine and resin; and to a lesser prominence, some juicy tropical tones. Flavor profile matches the nose in terms of individual tones. More bitter than you might expect, favoring grapefruit, lemon, and citrus peel a touch more than other fruit..  1,015 characters	4.57
2086	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	16 oz. can dated 3/21/19. Nice and fresh. Poured into Aslin anniversary glass.. L: Nice 2F white pillowy head with good retention and a cap and ring. Beer is a hazy golden orange.. S: Grapefruit and pineapple and peach predominate. A little bit of grass/earth..  560 characters	4.44
2087	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"Canned on 1/22. Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 1/25.
A:Peach and slightly orange side opaque colour, inch of cloud and nice lacing remain.
S:Peach and pineapple and mango aromas. Very Sweet aromas.
T:Peach, orange and pine notes. Mild bitterness and sweetness.
M:silghtly creamy Low Carbo.
O:Very soft and mild and smooth, lighter side body."	4.33
2088	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	11/2014 - Wow, this is amazing; incredible aromas of peach, dank hops, fruit poppin'! Mildly sweet, hoppy, zesty, fruity too flavors on the palate; so good and balanced.	4.58
2089	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Got a pour into a growler, so very very fresh.. Pours a rich orange gold color, fully opaque with a two finger off-white head that leaves sporadic lacing. Aroma is dense and pungent with tangy citrus notes. This is pretty intense and rockin'.  713 characters	4.79
2090	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Trillium can't seem to do wrong in my eyes. Fort Point is my favorite base beer, and galaxy is one of my favorite hops so this was a match made in heaven for me.	4.75
2091	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Theres just something about trillium beers and this one is not exception. They call it a Pale and that's definitely up for debate. But whats not up for debate, is the notation that this is a world class brew! Because it is! The Galaxy dry hop on this beer gives it an extra does of that New Zealand Spiciness while at the same time delivering distinct tropical notes and trillium's yeast strain helps to add a dry snappy finish. It's an amazing beer worthy of your seeking.	4.54
2092	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	16oz can dated 3/30/18.. Cloudy yellow body with a moderate head and retention. White grape, mango, peach, and grapefruit in the nose. Medium bodied with a creamy, crisp mouthfeel. Juicy tropicals on the palate with zero malt and a firm, drying bitterness. Peach, grapefruit, and white grape. Finishes with plenty of lingering unripe peach.. Great beer, tastes like a Congress street light.	4.46
2093	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Look- Hazy orange. Slight translucency with a nice creamy head. Smell- Nice citrus tone. Best part about this beer. Taste- it's good. Has a nice piney, resiny flavor with slight citrus tones. Falls flat though for how highly ranked it is.  408 characters	4.44
2094	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Canned on: 12/8/17. Opened on 12/9/17 Update review ** canned on 7/9/18.. Orange tinted gold coloration, muddy body, opaque depth, with a puffy white cloud of foam recedes slow. A bit of scattered coverage is left over with nice lace.. The nose is very powerful. Pungent citrus , wild honey pie, starfruit and herbs with a fruity, tropical blend and black pepper from the rather excellent Galaxy hop strain. Tangerine, pineapple and sweet red fruits all blend together harmoniously..  2,126 characters	4.38
2095	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Might be my favorite beer from Trillium, along with DDH Congress St and a few others I've enjoyed throughout the past few years, it's the perfect installment of Fort Point - DH Galaxy WINS. Smooth and balanced, Creamy Citrus and Pineapple is accompanied by gentle mouth feel. Mild finish, the daily drinker, and will impress any beer drinker.	5
2096	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Pours a hazy golden yellow with thick head and sticky lacing. Nose is full grapefruit, other citrus, floral, and hops. Flavors are very good, a lightly bitter hops with light grapefruit and other citrus notes, minor floral sweetness, and a very minimal pine, the finish is a little sweet malt and dryness, overall a complex mix that just eases you thru this beer, very impressed. I want to say for me this has a little west coast feel.	4.6
2097	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Assumed fresh can poured into Lagunitas mason jar. Pours a muddled, hazy orange peach with 1 finger of orange tinted, off white head. Minimal lacing. The nose is citrus, orange, grassiness and some pine. Soft, tropical fruits, mango, pine and resin in the finish. Somewhat of a malty finish too. Mouthfeel is spot on and very drinkable. Another win, can they make a bad beer?	4.31
2098	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"look is juicy orange haze
smell is citrus and mangoes
taste is initially bitter but yet juicy, sort of like somewhat ripe persimmons
overall, really good pale ale"	4.45
2099	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"Hazy orange juice, small head diminishing quite fast.
Fruity nose, exotic fruits, a bit dank, green.
Juicy, slightly bitter, long bitterness aftertaste.
6.6% you don't feel at all! High drinkability!"	4.43
2100	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. look is a murky orange with bright white head. smell is muted hops and tropical fruits. taste is dank hops along with the muted tropical fruit flavors. it’s pours beautifully but it’s a bit tame, muted, possibly even a bit off. feel is excellent. lower carbonation and full. this would be a world-class pale ale if not for the ‘off-ness’ of the aromas and flavor. and it’s not so much off as it is toned down. perhaps that’s an APA vs. an IPA/DIPA where they are trying to give it more drinkability. i say let those flavors shine but it’s still a very solid beer.	4.4
2101	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"A - Pours a soft yellowish orange with a 1/2 inch foamy head.
S - Aroma is not strong, I get melon.
T - Flavor is tropical fruits with some bitterness.
M - Average mouth feel and carbonation.
O - Fort Point might be my favorite Pale Ale, and this is a mighty fine version of It."	4.56
2102	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	After trying DDH Congress, DDH Summer, DDH Sleeper, Dialed In and this one, Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point was perhaps my second favorite. It was incredibly smooth and juicy with the least amount of bitterness of the group and the best, most consistent and even aftertaste. Sleeper and Dialed In were better looking, brighter and hazier. But this is just such a crushable ipa.	4.51
2103	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Cloudy dark straw appearance with a white head that is very appealing to th eye. Aroma is a very pleasant citrus. Taste is also a very pleasant and smooth citrus. One of the best APAs I have had.	4.75
2104	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	A 16 oz can date 8-15-17 poured into a tulip.. Look- a beautiful hazy orange with 2 fingers of thick foamy white head. Nicely wrapped lacing down the entire glass.. Smell- tropical explosion with a nicely dominant aroma of mango and galaxy hops. Everything you could want from a NE brew..  791 characters	4.84
2105	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	"L: Pale yellow, burnt orange color, hazy but not turbid looking, nice white head that settles out to a film
S: Sweet honey, cracker/grain, melon, sweet basil, touch of citrus
T: Up front is melon and tropical fruit, finishes with a dry grain finish, very low bitterness
F: Smooth, refreshing, high carbonation. Almost a tad thin, but its largely a preference thing
O: Absolutely a top notch pale ale, tons of complexity here, only gripe is its a little too cautious, almost have to really search for some of the beauty in this beer, would be nice if it was a bit more explicit"	4.28
2106	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Tasted from can. Pours a murky gold with thick white head. Aroma is passionfruit, mango, pineapple, melon. Taste is moderately bitter. Flavors of tropical fruits similar to aroma with some resin, caramel and toffee. Excellent IPA.	4.47
2107	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	Very good beer. The nose wasn't quite there. Would have liked a bit more body and a bit more flavor. Im just being picky. This is obviously a world class brew. Just splitting hairs here.	4.19
2108	Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale	16oz can poured into speiglau glass. Canned on 05-MAY-17 09:01. Deep mango purée in color with a great tuft of foam atop. The scent of apricots, tangerines/clementines, and other bright citrus fruits burst out of the glass. The taste has a great pungent hop pang, bringing citrus fruits, peaches, pineapple, and melon rinds. Fine finish with a lingering bitter character. Exceptional brew.	4.61
2109	The Broken Truck	Sampled at de Grade for 6th Anniversary. End of bottle pour.. Pale golde, light, effervescent. Aroma and taste offer notes of Apples, grapes, funk. Plenty of pucker left in this.	4
2110	The Broken Truck	What has become a standard to which others are compared for American Wild Ale. Too bad it's so limited as it should be enjoyed by all. A world class beer.	4.5
2111	The Broken Truck	Bottled 1/19 - beautiful straw color, thin cream head hangs out. Smells like citrus and bread, tastes similar with a lot of complexity. Really easy to drink with medium tartness. Love it	4.84
2112	The Broken Truck	Almost a full 5! Extremely complex with all kinds of fruit/spice/earth. No adjunct beer but lots of aging in barrels. Bravo! Enjoyed a bottle at the brewery in tillamook. 2019 vintage!	4.85
2113	The Broken Truck	"Batch 5, bottled January, 2019, drank over two nights in September, 2019 first from a Hill Farmstead stemmed wineglass, then from a Tree House Teku.. A beautiful looking beer that hit all the right notes from the look, feel and smell departments, same as others have described. The taste, again, hitting on those same descriptions, was good, but for me it ended up being just too acidic; I even had to ditch the last couple ounces as my stomach had had enough. Usually I'm ok with excessively wild wilds, etc. but the acidity for this version of BT (only one I've tried), was off the charts for me - it didn't actually taste ""overly"" acidic; the taste was really pretty good, it was more the effect that the acidic component had on my stomach. I have read this in a couple other reviews so not sure if this is typical of all BTs, or if it was more isolated to this batch. Or maybe some more time in the bottle would have helped? Either way, it was a bit of a disappointment, especially for a beer that I had waited so long to try and so eagerly anticipated."	4.35
2114	The Broken Truck	This one pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and not much lacing.. This smells like white wine, sour candy, peach, citrus, oak, and a deep dirty funk.. This has the complexity of actual Belgian lambic for sure, but maybe a bit more brash and aggressive than the most traditional takes. There's lots of white wine and white fruit flavors (white peach, white grape, etc). There's also bit of citrus rind and pepper, and definitely some spicy oak. This is so wonderfully delicious..  676 characters	4.65
2115	The Broken Truck	for how hyped up this particular one is, it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far, and frankly nowhere near the objective best, if thats not nitpicking at this point (all of them being so fantastic). i love the story of this, but from the bottle, it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have, especially some of the fruited ones. its really sour, more acidic than i remember most of them being, and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure, even with the amazing carbonation, soft round mouthfeel, and relative dryness to finish, its still just a slow sipper for me, which is probably how lambic should be anyway, but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly, and thats over the line for my preferences. perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long, being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it, but not all of these age favorably apparently. the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic, musty bretty and funky, with distinct juicy fruitiness to it, white wine, apricots, even ripe pears, its rustic and interesting, but with the acid its pretty aggressive. the oak is sturdy here too, grounding and dense all the way through which i really like, it seems sort of oddly hoppy, like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid, and if they did, there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow. its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style. despite the developed brett and heavy wood, this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend, less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring, and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character, this is almost too refined to fit that bill, not a criticism just a commentary. i think id like it more if the sourness were less, and dont get me wrong i still love it, but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers. always a treat to have their stuff though, and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now.... edit: this was leagues better the second time around for me, less acidity, a lot more nuance to the wild yeast profile, and with a fresh hoppy character to it at the end, tons of white wine, elderflower, and even white peach, its goegeous, and was a standout from a heavy session of amazing beers. not sure why it didnt taste like this the first time around, but i hve a raise a few scores to reflect how good it was this time. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing his bottle!	4.46
2116	The Broken Truck	Batch 4. Bottled 1/18.. A: Pours a pale golden, somewhat hazy, with two fingers of white foamy head. Very good retention and some dots and streaks of lacing. Champagne-like effervescence.. S: Musty and dusty (in a good way) like a wine cellar, moderate amount of earthy funk, and light apple and graininess. A very appealing and elegant expression of Brett..  655 characters	4.39
2117	The Broken Truck	This bottle came out of left field - a tremendous and very welcome surprise. One of the newer members of our share group is a form member of the Urban Family team and has a deep selection of brewery bottles and west coast stuff - including, apparently, this specific bottle.. The beer pours a light gold, mostly transparently, with a hugely funky nose. It's fairly sour and funky, with a medium mouth feel, and a bit of tartness. Slightly acetic, though my stomach had been suffering all evening long from sours. The finish does not linger, so it's fairly pleasantly clean.. Fantastic - this stands up to hype and reputation. I'm quite thankful, having been able to try it.	4.71
2118	The Broken Truck	04/2016 - This is a superb American representation of a gueuze; incredible minerality on the nose, plus funk, barnyard, oak; the palate is lightly creamy, funky, earthy, and a touch of lemon zest; so excited to see how this matures!	4.65
2119	The Broken Truck	Hazy pineapple juice yellow with a large fuzzy white froth that dies quickly to a lightly spotty film.. Smell is pungent, sweaty apricot, aged hops, grapefruit and weed.. Taste is smoother than the nose suggests, but still pungent of peach and grapefruit, sort of like the 2013 Vigneronne we just had before it. Actually this is better, but the Vig seemed a bit off, as though it hadn't aged well. This BT also has a touch of lemon rind. As it warms, and you get closer to the sediment, the oaky funky actually becomes a bit cedary--very unique!.  779 characters	4.12
2120	The Broken Truck	B3. Massive oak, funk, tart, acidic, rustic lambic/gueuze. Dark golden oaky appearance, long lasting head, and delicate lacing. Lemon and grapefruit rind lingers on the palate. Full bodied acidic mouth feel. So satisfying!	4.94
2121	The Broken Truck	Rating is for B1 poured 8 Wow didn't think this was going to live up to the hype, but I thought it was geuzey, rich, acidic, but not over the top. Had some citrus qualities. For the price I think DDG B2 is still a better get but I think if it was straight up I would take this. Great american styled geuze, lambic. One of a kind.	4.79
2122	The Broken Truck	Batch 3 poured into de Garde shooter glass. Pours semi clear with minimal head that dissipates quick. Aroma is funk and oak. Flavor is an explosion of funk and oak...lots of barrel in this yet so perfectly balanced. Feel is high carb, light on the palate. Champagne like. Overall, outstanding wild ale. Funky, tart and oaky.	4.59
2123	The Broken Truck	Batch 3 poured from a 750mL bottle into a De Garde snifter. Thanks Ryan for sharing this bottle!. Pours a hazy golden orange body with a twin finger white head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of retention and spotty lacing.. On the nose, lots of woody oak, comes through with a funky saison yeast aroma.. grassy, citrus and lactic, spices, funk, yeasty, grassy, and an almost cedar-like smell..  756 characters	4.59
2124	The Broken Truck	Shockingly tasty - I know it's very highly rated, but for some reason I just didn't trust it to be as good as it was. Very easy drinking with a wonderful overall flavor. Probably my favorite de Garde to date.	4.56
2125	The Broken Truck	Batch 2 is a delicious beer with just the right amount of sour, funk, and barrel presence... pillowy and light but with a nice full mouthfeel.... very balanced with complex flavors that keep coming for minutes after you swallow.... worthy of the hype!	4.6
2126	The Broken Truck	Light orange color with no head. Intense aroma. Tart with stone fruit, lemon, oak, green apple. Apple becomes more pronounced on the taste as it warms. Aggressive oak barrel, tannins, and lactic acid. Grapefruit, lemon. Mouth feel is medium to full. It's a little too acidic to be elite, but this is a fantastic beer. It reminds me of a lot of side project beers because it is so intense and sour.	4.57
2127	The Broken Truck	"Batch 2. A: Golden straw with some head that doesn't want to stick around.
S: Bleu cheese, green apples, pears, lemon peel, oak tannins, musty cellar.
T: Every sip is different. The initial is of earthy, bleu cheese funky, dirty dishwater. Dive into the second and here comes some of those green apples, but with the skin still on there and some of the pears. Third sip brings out the lemon peel and the oak. It has that aged beer taste, hard to explain, but if you've drank older vintages of gueuze you get what I'm saying.
M: It has that heavy lactic acid burn, very dry finish. Mouthfeel is a little muddled for me, starts out medium but because of that aggressive sour, leaves a little watery at the very end. Now I'm not rating it low for this, because it's still awesome, but after the DDG's soft, pillowy mouthfeel, I kind of wanted that.
O: This beer is killer. So reminiscent of a Cantillon Gueuze to me. A ton of funk and such depth of flavors. Super complex and just a pleasure to drink."	4.72
2128	The Broken Truck	Thanks to my buddy Mat for tracking this down and sharing! This was Batch 1 and it didn't disappoint! Tons of juicy tart fruit! Would love to try batch 2 as well!	4.91
2129	The Broken Truck	Pours a nice golden lemony yellow with a nice 1 inch head in the snifter. Smells of lemony rind with a nice funky sour smell. Taste is like the smell with a nice smooth tartness and a wonderful oak barrel finish. A awesome beer.	4.88
2130	The Broken Truck	B2. This is De Garde's masterpiece and probably the best American lambic out there. Taut and fruitier than most Belgian gueuezes without fruit. Slightly funky and sure to age with grace. Wish I had B1 now since most are saying it is better.	4.75
2131	The Broken Truck	The more I look back on this beer the more I love it. It was probably one of the most complex beers I've ever had. Perfect amount of funk and taste. The aftertaste sits with you for a long time. I had no. 2. It was very delicious.	4.98
2132	The Broken Truck	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, blue session. Blend 3. Aroma is quite funky with overripe peach and farmhouse notes. Taste is dry, funky with aspirin notes. Light, effervescent body. I also had a sample from the second batch a year ago and it was pretty much the same. I still don't understand why it's so highly regarded. Many other de Garde beers are much better.	3.75
2133	The Broken Truck	Batch 1, poured from the bottle into a taster. Huge barnyard funkiness with a bit of nuttiness. Great gueuze style beer while remaining distinctively de Garde.	4.92
2134	Abricot Du Fermier	Hazy orange body with tons of funk on the nose. Some tartness, but not too much. Delicious funky flavor that you only get biting into an apricot, just perfect.	4.93
2135	Abricot Du Fermier	The beer pours a hazy straw yellow with a moderate white head, it has medium carbonation. It smells of apricots, nectarines, and red wine. The beer is tart, with big apricot, juicy nectarines, red wine, and oak. The beer is multi layered, and very juicy. An excellent saison from Side Project.	4.79
2136	Abricot Du Fermier	This is the best sour saison I have ever had. Not even up for debate. The apricot is the perfect star for all of the delicately balanced flavors in the original. Has a bit of wine dryness to go with the sour and smooth tartness that really made the mouthfeel just mind-bendingly good. Rich, complex, smooth and acidic.	4.75
2137	Abricot Du Fermier	Another superb SP fruited sour - eff yes! Awesome apricot, peach abound; yet not acidic whatsoever; nice tartness in the back of the palate; creamy, slightly sweet, and just crushable AF.	4.46
2138	Abricot Du Fermier	Poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP stemmed wine glass.. Pours a hazy orange body with a fluffy white head that reduces to leave leggy lacing and minimal retention.. Aromas are potent and pungent - ripe stone fruits, apricot, a little grassy and floral, white wine, tart but not sour smelling..  555 characters	4.59
2139	Abricot Du Fermier	Pours a beautiful golden - surprising clarity, I'd expected more yeast suspension. Immediately after popping the cap, apricot permeated the air - it has a tremendous nose, clean and tart and fruity. The taste follows suit - tart, sour, full of apricots. Rich, yet not the yeasty beast that I had anticipated. Finish is fairly clean as well, which is surprised me a bit. This is quite likely one of my top 3 beers from Side Project at this point - I'd gladly trade for more any day!	4.75
2140	Abricot Du Fermier	750 ml poured into a teku at a share.. Look is golden orange. In the glass, it resembles the color of an apricot. Really great looking beer. Minimal head, no lacing and good carb.. Aroma is of fresh apricots followed by some funkiness. Really smells great..  594 characters	4.52
2141	Abricot Du Fermier	Blend #3.. A: Pours a pale orange, nearly opaque, with a half finger of bright white head. Pretty good retention and a bit of lacing.. S: Juicy stone fruit (apricot), horseblanket funk, oak and a bit of spice (clove), light white wine and tropical fruit. Pretty appealing..  586 characters	4.15
2142	Abricot Du Fermier	this is really good, no doubt about it, but not as good as they say it is i dont reckon, and once again a side project beer doesnt quite live up to its hype. their culture has trended super sour lately, and this is another expression of that, just really acidic beer, complex still, still lots of nuance, bretty funk and oak and all, but its the bacterial intensity that takes over this one and makes it a hard large bottle to drink, even split a couple of ways. i really like to let these types of beers warm up a little bit, but not here, its best when its colder, with temperature comes acidic intensity thats hard on the teeth and belly. i like all the apricot of course, about as natural as it gets, super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit, very forward and incredibly natural and delicious, the authenticity is through the roof. i kind of wanted to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile, which is tannic and heavily oaky, but not as red wine forward as i might have thought for cabernet. all the wood is nice, subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow, killer with the apricots, peach juice notes, even green apple and white grape wrapped up in here, lots going on, but instead of mellowing into a slow tart bretty funkiness like i wish it did, the sourness cranks and disrupts the delicate beauty, it finishes harsh and big. i mean, in all respects this is great beer, but it just doesnt stand with the best wild beers in the world to my palate, maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree, but i think its a little too much, unflattering to the fruit, and at $45 a bottle it just doesnt do it for me...	4.39
2143	Abricot Du Fermier	Pours a beautiful straw - light orange color. Pitch white frothy head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a sudsy ring around the glass. Nose is ripe apricot, stone fruit, prickly pear, getting some oak, barnyard funk, bready yeast. Taste. Taste is follows the nose, getting apricots, green apple, lemon, a little grassy note. Tart, but not puckering. Acidic, but not harsh. Great smooth pillowy mouthfeel. Soft on the palate. Overall a fantastic fruited Saison. Everything you would want, very well balanced.	4.59
2144	Abricot Du Fermier	Abricot Du Fermier, Batch #3, is beautiful. It's what you hope for based on its name. Glowing bright yellow, smooth and even soft looking. A fluffy white cloud is perched above the bright sunshine from below, and it's making me thirsty.. Cracked wheat and an acidic sour aroma is complimented, not overpowered, by wonderful levels of oak and the star of this show, the sweet, juicy apricots. Cut grass, hay, and more sunshine, as if wet wooden panels are being steamed by it in the morning. It's complex, yet beautifully simple.. And the flavors are even better. I can almost say they are identical, but the texture must play a factor here as it is velvety soft, and carries them remarkably. Everything you could ask for in a rustic wild Saison. Tart, but not puckering, light, but not something to guzzle, and full of all the right flavors of wood, hay, wheat, bread crusts, barn funk, and in this case the simple introduction of apricot..  1,208 characters	4.53
2145	Abricot Du Fermier	Nice sour qualities but on par with a lot of apricot sours. I dig the white wine barrel qualities. Quite full feel for a wild ale. Nice overall but nothing mind blowing particularly for the hype surrounding this one. As this warms the sour qualities become quite abrasive. Glad I split this between 4.	4.21
2146	Abricot Du Fermier	Super vibrant orange, almost neon, with a persistent lumpy off-white foam that settles to a thick collar and thin film.. Aroma has faint notes of various fruits like apple, orange and apricot, all on toast, with some funk, peppery oak and cheese that's kind of reminiscent of Gose, even with accents of seaweed and salt. I also detect some PEZ towards the tail end of a whiff. However, as it warms, the toast transitions to a breadiness that becomes completely overwhelming at the end of the session.. Having just had a full bottle of Apricot Casey Family Preserves, that one tasted more fresh, herbal and orchard-like. AdF is sharper, more sour, a little less fruit expressive, but with a bit more oak. The sourness nears vinegar at times, but avoids it thankfully. It's also kind of orangey and grassy with some peach candy in the swallow. Finally, funk is more present than Casey's, albeit lightly so..  1,127 characters	4.02
2147	Abricot Du Fermier	Had this on tap last weekend at the cellar- look and feel were both light and great for the style. Smell was good but not overwhelming. The taste was off the charts incredible. The best sour I've ever had.	4.84
2148	Abricot Du Fermier	poured from a 750mL bottle into an oversized snifter. pours a hazy and bubbly orange with fluffy bright white head, which eventually dissipates leaving a nice foam collar around the glass. some off-white swirls remain throughout the pour. smells of fresh sliced apricot, oak, wine and a hint of vanilla. it’s all there and combines for an amazing aroma but the fruit is the star here. the barrels give it more complexity than it would have otherwise but it’s very fruit forward. taste is basically dominated by fruit, however, the barrel characteristics are more noticeable than on the nose. it’s sour but it’s also refreshing. borders on light and heavy as it starts off lighter, simple and more refreshing but gets heavier and more complex as it lingers on the tongue and finishes. feel is smooth and full with an oaky dryness on the finish. overall, this is my favorite fruited fermier as i feel like apricot works so well with sour beer. the combination of the base beer along with red wine barrels and apricots is exquisite. this one probably doesn’t show the balance that some of the other fruited fermiers have (Pêche and Kriek come to mind) but i don’t mind that at all as this allows the apricots to shine with just enough backup from the extended-aged base SdF.	4.71
2149	Abricot Du Fermier	Batch 2, poured into a taster. Funky apricots and oak, soft mouthfeel, nice tartness without being super acidic. One of my favorite Side Project offerings to date!	4.69
2150	Abricot Du Fermier	Pours a orangish opaque color with a small white head. Smells of funky sour apricots. Taste is very acidic and tart with a pungent sour finish. A realmouth puckered. But in a great way. Wonderful thick mouthfeel.	4.85
2151	Abricot Du Fermier	B2, Had this side by side with 30 other tremendous apricot sours and saisons. It was a damn good beer but i liked La Fosse better and Westly. Maybe it was more apricotty fresh but it was tart and good, but didn't blow me out of the water either.	4.26
2152	Abricot Du Fermier	"batch 2 drank on 5/13/2017 at dld. Look - nice thick orange body and minimal head....really bold looking
Smell and Taste - huge burst of fruit! apricot galore! oaky and fruitiness are so bold
Feel-mild puckerness but the flavors really sit and linger well...tastes closer to a Wild than a Saison, but no complaints at all
Overall - amazing. Will seek this out again as the SP fruits continue to amaze"	4.75
2153	Abricot Du Fermier	Combined notes for Batch 1 and Batch 2. Really nice apricot notes and a bit creamy. Batch 2 was a bit too acidic for my taste, though I'm fairly sensitive to that. As with Fou Foune, would prefer to drink this one as fresh as possible to avoid too much acid buildup.	4.5
2154	Abricot Du Fermier	Bottle: Poured alight peachy color ale with a bubbly head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light apricot and tart notes is pretty refreshing and pleasant. Taste is a nice mix of tart notes with some fresh apricot notes and a white wine-like finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Acidity level is kept at a reasonable level. Very refreshing with solid mix of complexity.	4.22
2155	Abricot Du Fermier	Some of Side Projects finest! Had this along side Westly and it was every bit as good IMO! Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!	4.71
2156	Abricot Du Fermier	Really fruity and creamy smell, taste is soft, delicate, creamy, little sweet and most of all really fruity. Apricots all the way. To me, this is even more fruity than Fou Foune, I really like this beer.	4.9
2157	Abricot Du Fermier	A: Hazy golden color with a little bit of head. How a barrel aged saison should look. S: From the smell alone I knew this was going to be the best beer of the night. So much apricot, funk, and just a hint of tart. T: Now I've heard this thing is super sour, when it is chilled, it's all fruit and heavy doze of funk. As it warmed, it got sour, not as sour as the La Fosse, but more so than the PN3. M: Medium to full, probably one of the better mouthfeels on a saison that I've had. O: This beer was superb. Cory is making stellar beer. This one was the star of my apricot/peach sour tasting. I'm a huge Hill Farm fan, Side Project to me is right up there with them.	5
2158	Abricot Du Fermier	Easily the best apricot sour I've had. So much fruit and balanced acidity. It works incredibly well. Hard to believe this is 8%. Great offering, wish I had more	4.85
2159	Alter Ego	"Dated 1/29/19, drank on 2/15/19. Look (4.75): opaque golden orange. Nice 1.5 finger foamy head.
Smell (4.75): sweet fruitiness, but also smooth hops without harshness
Taste (4.5-4.75): bright grape fruit citra flavors with smooth hops
Feel (4.75): full medium body, super smooth
Overall 4.75"	4.75
2160	Alter Ego	Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstraw with a one finger head; a few shards of lacing. Smell: Papaya, melon and peach aroma. Taste: Papaya and melon forward with just a hint of peach and blueberry; low bitterness, through the middle with the fruit flavors dominating the finish.  575 characters	4.24
2161	Alter Ego	A - A dark orange body, with a slightly reddish tinge. Short white head, persistent, with small-bubbled lacing.. S - The nose is bright fruit, citrus in the form of orange and grapefruit, peach and tropical fruits like mango and pineapple.. T - The flavor follows, with orange juice and peach flesh front and center, mango and banana notes, and a hint of pith in the finish..  518 characters	4.84
2162	Alter Ego	The can pour is a densely cloudy crayon yellow. The effervescent cap is very fine. The aroma is strong with pineapple, strawberry and mango. Mango, orange and some grapefruit are large in the flavor. There is significant hop burn, but this is okay. The mouthfeel is very smooth nonetheless. This is a superb NEIPA.	4.41
2163	Alter Ego	Really good, probably the best New England style IPA I have had. Juicy, citrusy, tangy, fruity, smooth, and enough bitterness to not be sweet, an awesome beer all the way around. Often I don't like mosaic, but this is great. I hate to jump on the hype train because that's not what I do, but this beer is simply awesome.	4.64
2164	Alter Ego	Looks like a murky glass of white grapefruit juice with two fingers of pillowy, off white head sitting on top of it. The smell is simply grapefruit, sweet malt and pine. Tastes moderately sweet with a ton of grapefruit and pine. Creamy feel and a lingering bitterness. Fantastic beer.	4.56
2165	Alter Ego	16oz can dated 3/19/19.. Pours murky gold with an inch of white, whipped white head. Retention is good with dense lacing. Pithy citrus in the nose but subdued. Hints of grapefruit and hard peaches. Medium bodied with a chaulky, chewy mouthfeel. Grapefruit pith with bitter citrus skins on the palate. Finishes with plenty of bitter pith and minimal malt.. Certainly my least favorite Treehouse so far.	4.04
2166	Alter Ego	Poured from a tallboy can into a Fiddlehead Teku. L: Thick opaque juice bomb pour. Thick fluffy white head leaves great lacing.. S: Citrus and tangerine. Lighter tropicals. Juicy and fresh..  561 characters	4.52
2167	Alter Ego	Canned 8/16/17; drank 9/7/17 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque dull orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a HUGE off-white head; a thick curtain of lace..  418 characters	3.75
2168	Alter Ego	"Canned on 1/29 , Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 2/11 .
A: Slightly heavy Orange and very haze colour. One finger of could and naice lacing.
S: Bright Citrus aroma.
T:Orange, Mango, peach and accent of bitterness. Felt malts weight heavy.
M:Medium Carbo. Felt like a peach juice. Mild and rich.
O: Easy to drink but good complexity of fruitiness and hops notes.
Mosaic, Amarillo"	4.35
2169	Alter Ego	"Traded for this a long time ago, even though I've had sips of it a few times while waiting in line in front of Other Half. Of course, this was and still is one of their classics and even though my can was quite old, I enjoyed the taste and how easily it went down!. Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was turbid, dark, and apricot. Tons of head topped this off but that was probably due to how old it was than anything else and the lacing left behind was not thin, aside from a thick collar along the top. Lots of citrus, tropical fruit, dank hops, and some forest in the nose as this was a bit heavier than I would have liked. Some rind, pith, and dough from the malt came into the taste as this was quite full and balanced, with a good amount of citrus slickness present to keep the Mosaic from dominating. Somewhat soft, the carbonation was light as well as the juice lingered for a while but was never too sweet.... Not a lot of booze in this one, though it felt stronger than 6.80% ABV. Canned on 1/26/17 (yes, I'm behind!) with ""JOEY JO JO"" written above it and ""JR. SHABADOO"" written below it, this typical of Tree House's efforts but not as good as their more popular offerings. Not a letdown here by any means but the Mosaic didn't add any appeal to me..."	4.25
2170	Alter Ego	This beer pours an opaque amber/gold, with a frothy head. The smell is subtle compared to the burst of flavors one notices when sipping this beer. As mentioned, the taste has a whole host of flavors, including melon, pine, and a burst of various citrus fruits. This beer really hides the high alcohol content with some many different flavors.	4.74
2171	Alter Ego	Pint can dated 11/06/18 - poured into a snifter at about 44F. Huge thanks to Matt for this one.. Pours a very deep bronze honey color -99% opaque, with the slightest translucent gleam to it. Barely a finger of bone white head quickly settles to a small island and a sudsy collar.. Nose is beautiful on this. Honey biscuit sweetness, big melon, some subtle grape, berries, peaches, papaya, a little mango, a hint of passionfruit, some dank undertones, some pine resin. Smells sweet and hoppy..  1,451 characters	4.29
2172	Alter Ego	"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.. 16 oz. Can
Canned On: 10/10/18. Poured into a Tree House glass a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy two-finger off-white head, which also leaves some very nice creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a very nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, apricot), very nice diesel like. The taste is very nice hoppy, malty, with a very nice citrus complex (orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, apricot) very nice diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden very nicely, with a very nice little dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is a very very tasty brew. Orange Julius! Addictive! MilkShake! Thanks Bill!"	4.75
2173	Alter Ego	Trillium in a Tree House can. Sharp and fresh. Would try again, but I prefer Sap. Basically what you’d find at the brewery 90 min up the road. Can’t complain, an outstanding beer.	4.49
2174	Alter Ego	"Canned 11/06/18 ""TIM BUCKANOWSKI"". Picked up a few cans at the brewery. What can I say? Just something special about what TH does with their IPAs. This is as thick as fresh-squeezed orange juice and even more opaque with insane lacing. Aromas and flavors are off the charts. Zero bitterness but massive tropical fruit. A bit sticky yet super refreshing/juicy. Bonkers."	4.77
2175	Alter Ego	I gave this one a lower rating at first, but I think it improved with a month or so of aging after canning. The citrus flavors are more pronounced with a little time.	4.5
2176	Alter Ego	Appearance: Hazy and opaque golden amber color. A big, frothy, white head that settles down but still leaves a finger as I drink. Some lacing along the edge the glass.. Smell: The aroma of this beer stands out to me. Huge aromas of citrus including grapefruit and orange, stone and tropical fruit including mango and a lot of guava. Bready/doughy.. Taste: Very much follows the nose. Tons of tropical fruit and citrus..  740 characters	4.36
2177	Alter Ego	Appearance - Pours opaque like orange juice with big dense white head and big steaks of lacing all around the glass.. Aroma - Lots of sweet pineapple, mango, grapefruit mild hops and grain.. Taste - Huge hop flavors up front, sweet tropical fruit mango, orange with great bitter citrus peel on the finish..  478 characters	4.69
2178	Alter Ego	06/2015 - What a surprise and boy does it not disappoint; all the juiciness of Julius yet a really nice bite in the back end; fairly crisp, lightly bitter, yet very refreshing and clean.	4.46
2179	Alter Ego	A very good NEIPA. I get a strong amount of citrus, like clementines, with some pineapple in the background. there is a good balance between piney hops and sweer malt. Overall a very good brew.	4.69
2180	Alter Ego	Alter Ego pours thicker than expect burnt orange color with a great cloudy, with a 1-finger head that loves to linger with some excellent lacing retention. The smell is sweet malt with juicy pineapple and grapefruit up front with a bit of stone fruit and mango. Taste hits with a big bitterness up front followed by the juicy fruits with the pineapple and grapefruit. There's a candied sweetness midway through the swallow that helps to balance the flavor.	4.48
2181	Alter Ego	Very solid IPA related to Julius.. Tastes of orange and honey. Very light feel with non bitter aftertaste. Solid level of carbonation and a near perfect IPA.	4.5
2182	Alter Ego	a: super hazy bunt orange color with a nice caramel and amber note in there as well. large, 3 finger frothy off-white head. the color on this is incredible for a NEIPA. s: huge pineapple and apricot upfront. sweet clementines, big crackery malt, and passionfruit behind that. strawberry and guava behind that. a subtle grapefruit kiss and some grassy hops close out the aroma. t: follows the nose very close. pineapple and grapefruit punch right away. passionfruit and ripe mango behind that. a bit more of the grapefruit behind that with a very subtle bitterness presence. guava and sweet oranges close out the flavor with a touch of dry crackers.  1,033 characters	4.7
2183	Alter Ego	Pours cloudy, bright gold with a 2 finger soapy off-white head that leaves nice lacing.. Aroma is sharp and inviting with sweet, intense citrus notes. Flavor is even more sweet with a candied orange thing going on. Some pineapple in there too. There is a light malt that come through in the mid-taste that kind of anchors down the excessive hop flavors..  886 characters	4.45
2184	Saison Du Fermier	This is the best Saison I've ever had. Pours golden with a white head. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Tastes a bit like cider with hay, farmhouse, and citrus.	4.86
2185	Saison Du Fermier	Just another example of Side Project leading the way in American wild ale production. This is b2, and it’s lightly carbed with rich hay, grain, funk and citrus flavors. All blended meticulously with some kick from the wine barrel at the finish. Outstanding.	4.75
2186	Saison Du Fermier	"Blend #2
Appearance: pours a golden color with a white head that disappeared quickly. No sediment, fully translucent.. Smell: barnyard funk, tart apples, squeezed lemon, and white wine. A lot of depth with a subtle earthy spiciness.. Taste: tart green apples, lemon, barnyard funk, oak and white wine. Not one dominates over the other; it's well balanced, sweet, and tart. Flavors become more heavy and bold at room temp..  571 characters"	4.5
2187	Saison Du Fermier	Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden color capped by a one finger head of foam; scattered lacing. Smell: Fresh mowed grass, crusty bread, green apple, vinous oak, barnyard funk and a rustic yeast character. Taste: Green apple and lemon rind forward, with a vinous oak barrel flavor building; underneath, there are tones of fresh mowed grass, crusty bread and barnyard funk; through the middle, the flavors grow increasingly tart with a rustic, spicy yeast character.  631 characters	4.45
2188	Saison Du Fermier	Poured into a goblet. A bright yellow golden hazy beer with a medium white head. Aromas of hay, straw, lemons, and oranges. A hint of funk as well. Tart on the palate and mouth watering. More delicious with each sip. Great lemon and orange citrus mixed with hay, earthy notes, and a gentle funk. Dry and clean Easy drinking. Outstanding.	4.54
2189	Saison Du Fermier	Simplistic beauty is how I would describe this beer. The sour, funk, grain and sweet notes all are perfectly balanced with one another. Smell is oak sour with slight yeast funk, with accents of orange, lemon, vanilla, faint white wine, and caramel apple. Taste is taking all of the elements of the smell and putting them through an oaken filter, causing a delicate blend of flavor. Wish there was a little more potency there. Acidic sourness defines the finish.	4.35
2190	Saison Du Fermier	03/2015 - Another effing tasty beer from Side Project; lemon, funk, some barnyard, yeast aromas; effervescent, champagne, sweet, tart flavors on the palate; clean, crushable finish.	4.32
2191	Saison Du Fermier	The best beer of 2018 so far. Bottle from Mikkeller NYC. Nose is pure farmhouse w/ some acidity, apple, pear, and wet leather. The taste is perfect. There is subtle tart w/ funk and earth from the yeast and grains. The blend is perfect. The feel is amazing, a little heavier then the typical tart saison but goes w/ this offering perfectly. Well worth actively seeking out if you are a fan of saison or sour beer.	4.84
2192	Saison Du Fermier	Shimmering, lightly sparkling gold-amber with a moderate white fizzy foam that settles to a creamy ring and thin central film.. Complex and mature aromas of vinous oaks and grapes are accented by peppery herbs, straw and honeysuckle.. Tangy and lightly sour, flavors of green apple come along with an excellently balanced note of bright wine oak that adds an infinite complexity of grapes, orange rind and a hint of olive brine, becoming more acidic as it warms..  672 characters	4.16
2193	Saison Du Fermier	"b1. Slight gusher, but it just flooded the immediate area with floral and citrus aromas. A closer whiff reveals the typical SP rustic characteristics, though this seems to be much fruitier than some of their other offerings (at least the few I've had). It's almost like sticking your head inside of a used wine barrel.
Not sour but tarter in taste than the nose lends one to believe, but fits well with the fruitiness; reminiscent of a Gewürztraminer."	4.44
2194	Saison Du Fermier	Batch 4, poured into a tulip. Crisp and tart with a really nice soft mouthfeel and a bit of funkiness - I could drink this everyday. Looking forward to seeing how this one develops!	4.63
2195	Saison Du Fermier	Batch 4. Very tasty beer, but I would be hard pressed to identify this as a saison. Tons of oak and white wine as it is young, but much less dry and more tart than a typical saison. The only hints of saison are a few possible notes of saison yeast on the finish.	4.47
2196	Saison Du Fermier	Batch four, pour at FOFA.. Straw yellow, hint of cloudiness, whisp of a just off white head.. Citrus and earthy funk in the aroma, a hint of tartness in the form of green apple and sweet tart candy. Wine grapes and earthy wood..  315 characters	4.59
2197	Saison Du Fermier	batch 4 drank in a wine glass on 8/3/2017. L - slightly hazy yellow...thin white head, little lacing. S/T - white wine strong, oak, lemon, fresh cut grass, hay, slight funk, little green apple and grape.  441 characters	4.5
2198	Saison Du Fermier	Pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is relatively subdued. Little bit of funkiness and typical Saison aroma. The flavor is where this beer really shines. Absolutely exquisite says on with the perfect amount of tartness to balance it out and add that punch to each sip. Chardonnay notes come through very nicely. Mouth feel is as you would expect for a beer of this style. Overall, this may be the very best Saison I've ever had	4.74
2199	Saison Du Fermier	Poured from a 750mL bottle into a side project long stem tulip. Thanks Ryan for sharing this.. Pours a hazy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to leave a layer of white foam and little lacing.. Aromas of hay and grain, green apple and a little spices..  362 characters	4.54
2200	Saison Du Fermier	Batch #1. Poured a hazed golden yellow color with a bubbly, white head of foam. It smelled funky with strong lemon notes. Nice sour lemon taste with a good dose of acidity.	4.52
2201	Saison Du Fermier	This smells like a belgian dubbel and tastes like mild american wild. While this is a very nice beer, im dramtically underwhelmed. This is something along the lines of homebrew competition winner	3.91
2202	Saison Du Fermier	Nice funky beer. Side project is an awesome brewery. This review is for batch #3. Nice funky smell and taste. A glorious saison no fruit necessary. amazing job.	4.5
2203	Saison Du Fermier	A beautiful saison, both to look at and to drink. For this being Side Project's flagship, I'm very impressed. You can tell great care went into making this.	4.52
2204	Saison Du Fermier	"L: Golden straw hues with a minimal white soapy head with decent retention
S: Apricots, Meyer lemons, and a bit of funk
T: Juicy lemons and frank tartness; quintessential saison with bold citrus fruits and a refreshing dryness
F: Very evenly carbonated with a creamy finish that lingers
O: A fantastic saison offering by Side Project. The crisp fruitiness is complemented well by a distinct dryness on the finish reminiscent of an on-point chardonnay. Well executed and very memorable saison."	4.63
2205	Saison Du Fermier	Excellent Saison! Was lucky to trade for this recently and then took it to a share which included other Saisons and fruited Sours by SARA, Libertine, Council and Side Project and this one held its own and was top notch!! Light tart and smooth drinking!	4.58
2206	Saison Du Fermier	Batch 3. Bright hazy yellow. White head. Mini-gusher of a bottle. Light funk, tannins, and lemon zest. Earthy, dry, brett, and some wine barrel flavors. Lots of carbonation. Fizzy. Ends with brett.. Good saison. Nothing out of the ordinary, but quality.	3.86
2207	Saison Du Fermier	Batch 3 shared at a tasting in Pittsburgh. I'm tempted to give this a 5. There's nothing even close within the style, honestly. In it's own class. Pours murky yellowish with some white fuzzy bubbles around the top. Aroma is beautiful brett funk, sweet malts, hay, must, dust, some more slight sweetness. Incredible. Flavor follows with what can only be described as perfect. There is the funky brett yeastiness, then there is just enough sweet malt backbone that makes it impossible to forget it's in your mouth. What I find lacking in Hill Farmstead saisons--great beers, they are--is the perfect malt sweet balance that I find in this behind the funk. Just beautiful. Super easy drinking, but not too light bodied, medium plus carbonation, and oh so good. Among the best beers I have ever had. Going to be hard to drink any other saison after this one. (4.93/5). Now trying Batch 2 on 10/17/15. Interesting and large differences here relative to Batch 3. This one is overtaken by the lacto with big cheesy notes and much, much less Brett influence than before. The beer is beautiful, top level, and yet lags well behind the Batch 3 I had that was more fresh. Really interesting differences here, and I really miss the musty Brett funk and hay I was expecting to get from this. Nonetheless, delicious beer. (4.61/5)	4.93
2208	Saison Du Fermier	Not sure I can agree with others on here -- this is nothing at all like Saison Bernice (which is not sour/tart at all), nor is it all that juicy. It's just flat out sour. Perhaps I had an odd bottle (b3), but the sour was so dominant that other flavors had to struggle their way through. I thought it was dramatically more sour than Pulling Nails, even. It's tasty, but so sour that I wouldn't say I enjoyed it a whole lot (and I do like sours).	4.28
2209	Breakfast Stout	Smooth stout with a great taste of coffee, chocolate and oat. It is exactly what it says with a stronger ABV of 8.3. If you like stouts, this is a must try but drink in moderation and enjoy the taste and aroma!	4.76
2210	Breakfast Stout	This is simply incredible. Layers of chocolate over coffee, or coffee over chocolate. I can't tell, But whatever it is, it is just about perfect. Excellent mouthfeel and goes down oh so smooth. The roasted malts I think bind it all together.. Best part is that it is not cloying or overly sweet. The chocolate is the darker variety which I like anyways. You can tell the quality of ingredients is there.. A near perfect stout. I get the hype. Well deserved.	4.74
2211	Breakfast Stout	On tap at Oak and Stone in a tulip sampler glass. Pours dark as dark can be and tastes the same. Layers of chocolate, roasted malt, and smoke. No overly sweet attempts to hide what this is. If you don't like this beer, then you don't like stouts.	4.12
2212	Breakfast Stout	Deep, dark brown, almost black in appearance. Creamy tan head.. Nose is big chocolate up front with roasted malt and coffee. Brilliant.. Creamy, full mouthfeel that follows the nose...chocolate, malty, coffee, very slight bitterness. Deserving of world class status.	4.91
2213	Breakfast Stout	"L: deep tar brown
S: malt, chocolate, coffee
T: chocolate, coffee, smokey, bittersweet like a good dark chocolat
F: full bodied
O: pretty fantastic, lovely beer!"	4.75
2214	Breakfast Stout	Slight bitter with a very smooth finish. Very nice chocolate coffee beer! The first taste was surprisingly sweet. Would love to find this in Boulder Colorado.	5
2215	Breakfast Stout	"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a customer taster pint; bottled 8/29/19.
A: Pours a black color with about a one finger, light brown head, more than rim retention, and camouflage shaped lacing. Tiny bubbles appreciable.
S: Aromas of dark chocolate, lactose, honey, molasses, plum, and dark roasted coffee.
T: Semisweet than sweet. Flavors follow the nose and work together well, but are enhanced and offset by licorice, star anise, and white pepper. Bitterness solid and provides strong counterpoise to the sweetness.
M: Full bodied with moderate effervescence.
O: Picked this up at the Founders Brewing Company. Reminded me of a blend of breakfast stout and a foreign extra. Just delicious."	4.74
2216	Breakfast Stout	"Look Amazingly rich black with a tan head
Smell Aromas of dark chocolate with aromas of almost bourbon
Taste Rich , full, bitter, and chocolaty. coffee bitterness with a dry sweet finish. Molasses
Feel A full thick full feeling with a thinner finish than expecting
Overall An excellent oatmeal stout that is reminiscent of my first stouts of Sammy Smith ...with a little more of a kick
Very good absolutely worth every penny"	4.51
2217	Breakfast Stout	Founders Breakfast Stout is everything you could want in a Coffee Stout. The beer pours dark, rich, and creamy. The head is deep tan, foamy, and substantial. The feel is thick and satisfying. The taste is fabulous.. a strong, substantial top grade coffee balanced with luscious chocolate makes a bold statement. It is the finest beer I have ever tasted from a 12 ounce bottle. It is impossible to overstate how good this beer is. It is a world class production, and a gift from the gods. Founders Brewery performs a public service, bestowing this magnificent brew upon the masses. I keep it all year.. I make sure I never run out of this treasure.	4.87
2218	Breakfast Stout	Good color, no head. Clean and balanced with an extremely creamy texture and a strong coffee flavor. Overall a great, rich breakfast stout with wonderful hop balance.	4.07
2219	Breakfast Stout	What an amazing stout from Founders. The look is jet black, beautiful caramel toffee head, slowly dissipates. Rich, creamy, full bodied stout that has a great balance of malts, chocolate and coffee. It's a beautiful stout that would be perfect for a cool fall or winter night next to the campfire or on the patio. The Excellent coffee and chocolate notes. Pours very dark with a light tan head that dissipates quickly. Thick, rich mouthfeel, decadent almost dessert like. This is one of the best coffee stouts you’ll find anywhere. at 8.3 ABV it's well balanced and the alcohol is balanced and hidden well with the taste. I found that if you let it warm a little it really brings out the flavors and character of this beer. Very good and I highly recommend. Cheers!	4.73
2220	Breakfast Stout	Stout should pour with a strong head but this have me no head. A nice flavor with a good mix of hops, coffee, & chocolate, however, not a taste that is so exceptional like would appear from prior ratings.	3.87
2221	Breakfast Stout	Finest of the local package stores and priced accordingly. Very strong aroma of coffee grains and strong dark chocolate. Pitch black brew. Fine beer. Few are as good as this. I try to get a 4 pack every now and then to mix in with my daily drivers. KBS also very good from Founders. Both are excellent. High ABV though. Keep it to a few	4.79
2222	Breakfast Stout	"I was looking over all the ""wow""s in the reviews and wondering if it was good as advertised- and it was! Definitely a top dog among the coffee-flavored brews I've tried. Maybe a little too good, it's going down awfully fast... no hint of light comes through the black, and first sniff tells you about the taste."	4.62
2223	Breakfast Stout	Nice dark souls black with a caramel colored fluffy head, nice roast smell no chocolate smell, awesome chocolate hit with a little sweetness and a finish of bitterness, nice full body with light carbonation	4.18
2224	Breakfast Stout	It's delicious. Jet black in color, nice mouthfeel for a stout... syrupy and thick. Aroma is earthy, plenty of coffee, vanilla and malt present which carries through to the taste buds as well, zero hop, plenty of spice, mild bitterness and well restrained sweetness. It's complex but most of all, well balanced. My rating grade is just a shade under the CBS and KBS that Founders is well known for.	4.58
2225	Breakfast Stout	Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a tiny light brown head. Smells of coffee, very strongly. Tastes of coffee with slight chocolate, very creamy. Beer is full bodied yet easier to drink than it should be, decent carbonation. Overall, a superb beer.	4.41
2226	Breakfast Stout	"Look: Black with some brown hues. Big, creamy brown head.
Smell: Dark chocolate, coffee, cinnamon. Dark fruit (figs, raisins).
Taste: Tastes a lot like it smells. Coffee, caramel, toffee, raisin/grape, and dark chocolate. Dark fruit aftertaste with a hint of smoke.
Feel: Thick, creamy. Low carbonation.
Overall: Wow, this is a great beer. It's so good that it's hard to figure out which rating to give. Highly recommended!"	4.63
2227	Breakfast Stout	"Wow. Just amazing. I try not to throw the word ""perfect"" or ""masterpiece"" around liberally, because the overuse of those words definitely diminish the value of its description, but this is honestly one of those few exceptions I must allow.. This beer has everything. Rich, balanced-bitterness, dark, delicious, with a nice delectable coffee overtone throughout. This is honestly a treat. The beer's title certainly makes sense to me, because it's so pleasing and coffee-augmented that I could truly have it for breakfast (if it weren't for the 8% ABV at least).. For anyone who enjoys stouts, or just beer in general at this point, this is ABSOLUTELY a must-have. My only regret is that I hadn't tried it sooner."	5
2228	Breakfast Stout	"Bottled 9/19/18. Coffee, chocolate,
heavy cream, smoked wood, oats, caramel, tobacco. Sweet, full spectrum aromatics. Im picking up mostly espresso, dark chocolate, smoked oak on the tastebuds, hints of burnt sugar, with a bittersweet, chalky, dry finish."	4.24
2229	Breakfast Stout	L: Jet black color, two finger brown head, excellent lacing, no visible carbonation.. S: Sweet, chocolate. Smells wonderful!. T: Chocolate, coffee, sweet on the front end, some bitterness on the back end. Nice and balanced..  334 characters	4.49
2230	Breakfast Stout	Very dark, almost completely black but with very slight brown. Hits the nose with a lot of coffee, but noticeable chocolate. The taste wasn't what I expected. It's labeled as double chocolate, but the coffee taste comes out on top. Not necessarily a complaint. The chocolate is mainly in the aftertaste. Bitter, but not horribly so. The feel is a little thinner than I'd like, but thick enough to satisfy. Overall very good. For my tastes, it's easy drinking, but this style of beer is right up my alley. If you're used to lighter beers you'll want to sip and savor.	4.44
2231	Breakfast Stout	"355 mL Bottle. ABV 8.3%.
Appearance: Dark brown-black, Under a finger of dark toffee head, Inviting like a rich dessert or coffee, Head dissipates quickly.
Aroma: Lovely roasted malts, Coffee, Dark chocolate, Slight smoke, Slight molasses.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, Thinner than expected, Lingering bitterness, Alcohol warmth.
Flavour: Coffee beans, Bitter dark chocolate, Roasted malts.
Overall: Fantastic stout, which is heavy on the coffee. I will definitely enjoy this again. I'd love some more chewiness and body but this still remains a robust offering."	4.46
2232	Breakfast Stout	The Genesis of KBS and CBS. How could it be bad? Just as advertised, you get the coffee and chocolate. Dark, delicious and some hops balls too. Founders is so bad-ass for a reason! Thumbs up!!	4.65
2233	Breakfast Stout	This is going to be a great beer!. Oh. 60 IBU Stout. A good beer. Way too bitter to really appreciate the excellent flavors buried by the hops.. Some day, when the herd gets past the inexplicable “brew as many ridiculously bitter beers as possible” trend, a beer like this will truly be world class.	3.59
2234	Sunday Brunch	Big frothy dark tan head; good retention.. Nose is full of roasted barley, dark coffee, maple syrup, and brown sugar, and accented by cinnamon.. Sweet, creamy, and rich on the palate - not unlike egg nog. The coffee adds a sharp earthiness that barely manages to cut through the maple and cinnamon. Big creamy milk porter base is a lovely jumping off point for these flavors. Could use more coffee flavor, but the maple is a wonderful balance, bringing the exact right amount of sweetness, along with a woody note..  924 characters	4.51
2235	Sunday Brunch	Look is a traditional porter, black with a tan head that leaves minimal lacing. Nose is all expected, coffee, cinnamon, and maple syrup. Get some bakers chocolate as well. Taste follows the nose. Feel is luscious, but not oil thick. Overall, a great porter! Sweet aspects that do not become cloying	4.47
2236	Sunday Brunch	Huge like Hulk when he borrowed Barry Bond’s “vitamin supplements.” Huge, I’m talking huge coffee flavors like a hungover Sunday at Starbucks. But this beer wasn’t brewed with Starbucks. This is quality hipster coffee like the dork that lives below you who rides a fixie with a handlebar mustache to work. The only thing Raul isn’t feeling is the sweet maple syrup (cause your boi ain’t into sweetness), but it’s still quality. Also, I wish the mouthfeel in the end was a lil more viscous. It’s not bad. It’s not Martha Hunt super model skinny, but I’d prefer if it was Ashley Graham large.. Yep!	4.29
2237	Sunday Brunch	Poured into teku glass via bottle. Color is deep brown with mocha foam. Smell is copious amounts of cinnamon, coffee and maple syrup.  461 characters	4.57
2238	Sunday Brunch	Kane absolutely nailed this one. Silky smooth porter with abundant maple syrup, cinnamon and roasted malt flavor. Best porter that I've had, bar none.	4.63
2239	Sunday Brunch	The pour is black with mahogany colors on the edges, underneath a dense tan head. The first note on the nose is rich coffee - wow. This literally reminds me of brunch. There’s also a significant cinnamon component. I am now officially salivating.. The maple and cinnamon are more prominent on the taste, which really elevates this, IMHO, because they are the perfect balance to the roasty coffee flavors, and admit milk chocolate flavors to the imperial porter dance party Kane has served up.. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, which fits this beer perfectly. This flavor profile (chocolate, coffee, maple) is popular, and Kane absolutely nailed this with the cinnamon addition.	4.6
2240	Sunday Brunch	FINALLY!!!!. On tap at Kane 1/10. Allowed to warm as I could.. L: Light tan head with good retention. Leaves a bit of a ring. Dark black..  567 characters	4.59
2241	Sunday Brunch	What truly surprises me about Sunday Brunch is, in spite of being a non barrel-aged beer, just how complex and layered it is. The coffee is smooth and lightly roasty. The maple isn't super forward but it adds body and subtle, excellent flavor - tasting quite natural, by the way. The beer has great body and drinks easily. I really like this one - I can't imagine drinking a whole bottle by myself, but definitely enjoyed sharing this one with friends.	4.5
2242	Sunday Brunch	On tap at Morris Tap and Grill in Randolph. Pours a jet black ebony hue with minimal frothing. Complex aroma replete with hints of chocolate, and cream. Good stuff. Recommended.	4.35
2243	Sunday Brunch	This beer lives up to the hype. All of the ingredients are discernible but aren't overpowering. Nice notes of maple, mocha, and cinnamon. Medium+ mouthfeel. Minimal booze. Awesome.	4.55
2244	Sunday Brunch	Pours a dark brown color. Tons of nice sweet coffee and cinnamon. Milk and dark chocolate, roasted Malta, cream, and light molasses and maple. Thick body and low carbonation, easy to drink.. A great stout; so glad I have several bottles of this.	4.49
2245	Sunday Brunch	"750ml bottle poured into a snifter
Pours a deep black color with a creamy khaki head that has good retention. Smells of cinnamon, maple, french toast, and herbal flat coffee undertones. Tastes of coffee and cinnamon up front, followed by dark chocolate, creamy vanilla and caramel. The finish brings out sweet maple and more coffee. Medium body and medium carbonation, creamy mouthfeel and finish."	4.46
2246	Sunday Brunch	03/2015 - I've always a fan of this; awesome cinnamon and coffee, without either being overpowering, on the nose; lactose and vanilla ensure a nice sweetness on the palate; relatively thick body, especially for the style.	4.46
2247	Sunday Brunch	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Blue Session. Aroma has fresh roasted coffee beans, toasted malt and espresso notes. Taste has bittersweet coffee, cold brew and a fresh, roasty bitterness on the finish.	4.4
2248	Sunday Brunch	While placing the imperial porter at the end of any session makes a lot of sense when it comes to impact on the palate, as it's usually the strongest flavored beer of the day, coffee stouts can get in touch with out inner insomniac. But the imperial coffee porter of Kane Brewing is strong in its effects while carrying a caffeinated jolt; perfectly suited for pick-me-up and put-me-down of brunch.. Sunday Brunch is a formidable dark ale of such character and placement as it pours a sparsely headed black appearance, looking like dark roasted coffee immediately to the eye. Its onyx-like sheen precedes a decadent and roasty scent that's laced with maple, spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel and toffee.. Its decadence resumes across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to robust. French press coffee, black walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream and ushers in a bittersweet finish with rich suggestions of coconut, cinnamon and kahlua..  1,355 characters	4.52
2249	Sunday Brunch	750ml bottle thanks to Rick. Inky black pour, small beige head. Roast grains, coffee, cinnamon on the aroma. Taste brings a bit of ashy notes, more of the roast grains, mild coffee, cinnamon, french toast without the syrup.	4
2250	Sunday Brunch	The first whiff and sip of this beer is incredible. Cinnamon stands out most prominent over the nice coffee in the background. It's like a warm cinnabun. The only problem with this beer is it's quite sweet and it starts to take its toll if you have a whole glass. nb	4.25
2251	Sunday Brunch	Pitch black with a think mocha head. Rich milk chocolate and coffee with a hint of maple and a milkshake mouth feel. All the flavors were popping months after the release.	4.58
2252	Sunday Brunch	Smell was awesome. Nice cinnamon and maple. The initial flavor was what threw me. Almost like an apply flavor in the front, that melded into a maple bomb. Smelled great. Initial flavor not great. Back end flavor, decent	3.94
2253	Sunday Brunch	750ml bottle, served in a snifter glass. Pour is medium dark brownish/black body, one finger light reddish/brown head, good retention and bits of lacing. Smell is heavily roasted coffee bean, sort of slightly burnt in a way, milk chocolate, cinnamon, a bit of green pepper and espresso. A bit weird at first, I think the coffee and cinnamon combined to make it smell a bit burnt. Flavour is much better though, not a ton of maple syrup but neither is it too sweet. Cinnamon lingers the background throughout, perhaps contributing a slight green pepper, black coffee and dark fruit, a fair bit of milk chocolate and caramel. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and substantial, good carbonation and a smooth chocolate-forward finish. It kind of tastes like cinnamon sprinkled on chocolate frosting, in a good way.	4.35
2254	Sunday Brunch	"Pours a rich chocolate black color that is impervious to light. 2 inch tan head quickly fades to a light brown ring around the glass. Cinnamon dominates the nose, followed swiftly by Maple and coffee. Cinnamon and maple also dominate upon first sip, coffee moves in afterward and smoothes out the finish. This is definitely a full-bodied beer, carbonation is minimal and perfect. Overall a delicious and flavorful beer, none of the flavors overwhelmed or dominate, they are perfectly mingled together.. 10/12/17

2018 vs 2019 Vertical
2019: coffee dominates the nose and taste, has a bitterness from the coffee.
2018: coffee has completely faded, all I taste is maple syrup and cinnamon, tastes a lot sweeter than the new beer..  799 characters"	4.97
2255	Sunday Brunch	"Vintage 2017.
Opaque near black with a half inch khaki head that quickly disappears completely leaving only whisps of lace. The smell is of freshly brewed coffee, subtle maple and a hint of cinnamon. The taste follows with dark roast coffee and cream perfectly complimented by maple syrup and subtle cinnamon. Medium texture with low carbonation. Fantastic flavors flawlessly blending together. World class."	4.66
2256	Sunday Brunch	Great beer but the cinnamon was overwhelming to me. Literally everything else about this beer was great but man that cinnamon almost kind of ruined the whole experience.	4.7
2257	Sunday Brunch	Very good beer. Reminds me of a Morning Bell w/ less lactose sugar (i.e., less milky). Here goes:. A: Pitch black - pours a nice, white head that leaves a lot of lacing. Can't fault it.. S: Outstanding! Best thing about the beer. I love Rook coffee and was delighted to detect it in the scent. Lots of coffee, chocolate, and some malty syrup. Great..  619 characters	4.73
2258	Sunday Brunch	Sunday Brunch pours coffee brown but fills to matte black with a fluffy tan head leaving creamy lace. The head slowly dies to a creamy blanket that retains throughout.. This brew is the definition of aromatic. How does this sound: freshly ground cinnamon drenched in maple syrup with some Bailey's! Earthy, roasty coffee levels out what might otherwise verge into confection territory, including raisin and date, and there's even some cigar smoke--where from, I'm not sure.. On the palate this beer starts with a complex blend of dark, earthy roasted coffee that exhibits some cocoa elements. Tons of maple syrup-soaked cinnamon brings to mind French toast with raisins. Again, a smokiness emerges in flavor as well, evoking cigar, and adding complexity. I'm not sure if this is the cinnamon, the maple, the coffee, or something else like the malt. Maybe it's a combination of them all, but whatever the case, the hint of smoke is an excellent and unexpected addition. This literally tastes like brunch, and towards the end of the bottle it takes on an almost bacon-waffle combo that's just ridiculous..  1,623 characters	4.56
2259	Black Gold	Jet; meaty nose; cola, birch beer, A1 steak sauce, a thread of vanilla, hints of Bounty; bitter + chewy.. 4 4 4.25 4 4.25. Too much licorice. Another bottle that may have been held onto for too long: the peaks of chocolate around the savoury notes hint at another beer. Still, given the reputation, disappointing.	4.15
2260	Black Gold	I am nagging a little bit, because I think this beer deserves a better rating than a 4.5. I am a bit spoiled though and I am wondering if the cellar period influenced my rating. Nevertheless I do think this beer is worth looking for.	4.5
2261	Black Gold	12/2015 - Per most Central Waters' stouts, this has so much barrel abound! While there's certainly some heat, it's well executed and fairly smooth - classic!	4.25
2262	Black Gold	"2015 vintage
22oz bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki colored head that reduces to a ring around the edge. S- a near perfect mix of barrel and malt. Bold, oaky barrel on the nose brings out prominent notes of vanilla, coconut, caramel & barrel juice. Dark roasted malt gives notes of chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, nutty fudge, marshmallow, maple a hit of anise.  1,032 characters"	4.37
2263	Black Gold	2017 vintage. Pours black with a thin dark tan head. Aromas of bourbon, roast, some sweet vanilla and fudge. Maybe it's a bit thin, but not detrimental to the beer at all. Flavor is really well balanced barrel, roast, and some chocolate and vanilla. Doesn't fall short in any aspect, leaves nothing to be desired. Very much enjoyed this one.	4.55
2264	Black Gold	2018 vintage.. A: Pours black with a smattering of fairly fine, dark brown head that recedes quickly to a razor thing ring. A couple dots of lacing.. S: Vanilla, dark chocolate, delicious bourbon and oak, mint, light roast..  713 characters	4.31
2265	Black Gold	16, 17.. Big barrel presence. Chocolate, fudge, bourbon, vanilla. Biggest knock on this beer is the mouthfeel. It's just not on the same level as the rest of the experience. However, the flavors and barrel quality are fantastic.	4.54
2266	Black Gold	2018 release. A moderately aggressive pour into a teku begrudgingly produces a finger of cocoa powder-colored head atop a pitch-black, but not super-thick, liquid. Oak, tannins, plum, bitter dark chocolate, bourbon booze, and pepper round out the nose. The front palate is very restrained but quickly blossoms, with warming bourbon spice, barrel wood, vanilla, and fudge. Intense barrel character that I love--strong, with a lot of whiskey character, but without a hot mid-palate. Modestly dry finish that leans back into the vinous notes and adds just a touch of smoke.	4.47
2267	Black Gold	Pouring a slick, stark black ribbon and filling to matte black, Black Gold has a thin but dense and uniform mocha-gold blanket that settles only to a thin ring around the rim.. I could smell this all day. Black Gold has a very maple-forward character that's slightly smoky, sticky and sweet, and very rich. Nutty and surprisingly peppery oak follows with notes of chocolate wafer and a dollop of vanilla whip cream. A faint sting of bourbon complexity comes out at the end of an inhale, bringing with it a hint of caramel and candy corn.. It immediately strikes me how very dry and very woody yet somehow not hot this is at first taste, which is a telling mark of excellent blending. Taste verges away from the maple in the aroma, and instead goes in the direction of toasted coconut and smooth vanilla with an unbelievably delectable char that rises after the swallow. It's kind of like salted caramel and brownie crust, but quite notably mature, particularly as it warms, when mocha liqueur and tobacco develop..  1,241 characters	4.35
2268	Black Gold	"Pours black with a perfect lingering tan head.
Boozy bourbon, vanilla and toffee on the nose.
Taste follows the nose with a definite boozy bourbon burn. Will likely mellow with age. As it warms vanilla flavors begin to appear.
Nice smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel.
Top notch BA stout. Smooth and relaxing."	4.67
2269	Black Gold	Central Waters Black Gold BA Stout 2017, 13.2% ABV (as listed by taproom). Pours black with no head. Nose is bourbon, chocolate, and licorice. Taste follows, with moderate bitterness, and quite boozy. Decent mouthfeel, overall excellent. I've been hunting this whale for three years, and was a bit let-down. It was decent, but not as good as its reputation.	4
2270	Black Gold	GTFO with all these wildly overhyped reviews. This was to say the least overhyped, however it is not a bad beer by any stretch. Smell is sweet, chocolate, bourbon. Flavor is chocolate, raisins and bourbon. Body medium. Nice feel to it. Good carb. Overall smooth, but nothing stunning. This is dramatically better than BCBS 2017, but at this point that is no longer the bar	4.25
2271	Black Gold	Smell: Intense amounts of fudge and barrel. Huge amounts of oak and dry wood. Vanilla, marshmallow, coconut, milk chocolate, oatmeal cookies, maple syrup, toasted coconut, dark roasted coffee. The Barrel presence along with this rich fudgey chocolate make for one great smelling beer.. Taste: Oh my god! This is amazing. This is rich and complex. Everything on the nose transitions to the pallet. Upfront your greeted with layers of rich fudge and milk chocolate, along with the tannins from the barrel. The Barrel presence is there throughout the rest of the tasting experience. Middle of the mouth you get fluffy marshmallow, vanilla, maple syrup, Milk chocolate, oatmeal cookie and oak. The beer finishes with a mellow bourbon heat and layers of oak and wood to go along with this coconut and vanilla sweetness. With a touch of coffee roastiness lingering in the aftertaste.. Feel: Full body, thick, smooth and velvety. Rich with a nice amount of creaminess. By far the best mouthfeel I've ever had on a central Waters Stout..  1,337 characters	5
2272	Black Gold	Been waiting for this one for too long.... Taste is bourbon chocolate leather. Very silky which is nice. I get a slight bitterness on the back end, hops maybe? Nose is straight cocoa.. I like to compare beers. To me this is a similar beer to Bell's Black Note. I'd definitely give BG the edge. Given the limited availability of BG, I will probably prefer to seek out BN in the future.	4.37
2273	Black Gold	On draft at Central Waters Brewery. Poured into snifter glass.. Appearance: soy sauce with a thin layer of bright brown foam that quickly dissipated to a ring around the glass.. Aroma: a hot boozy mess. Picked up black licorice and sweetened chocolate with massive amounts of oaky booze mixed in..  1,057 characters	4.13
2274	Black Gold	Shared a bomber at hotel before Anniversary party this year. poured into hotel cups and it coated the plastic! pitch black. nose was mellow but had a nice amount of molasses and chocolate fudge. The taste followed suit but added some complex malt roastyness and also some sweet barrel and vanilla flavors. The feel was the star of the show, thick and mouth coating with just the right bitterness to balance the dry finish. Overall this was a fantastic beer that I was happy I shared but would have loved to dome by myself.	4.69
2275	Black Gold	Black color with minimal head. Molasses, chocolate, booze nose. Taste comes in waves of chocolate, bourbon, wood, vanilla with creamy feel and low carbonation.	4.59
2276	Black Gold	Pours coal black with a small beige head, collapsing to a ring of froth lacing.. Has an almost subtle barrel profile on the nose, hence the aromas are defined by a warming blend of milk chocolate, melting caramel, roasty bakers chocolate and a warming molasses touch. Spicy licorice and oak round out the luscious chocolate appearance with a hint of old leaves.. Has a warming, pleasantly boozy, silk mouthfeel, which is incredibly creamy and thick, rich on the tongue till the end..  1,149 characters	4.68
2277	Black Gold	2015 vintage; drank 12/11/15 @ Yuss Haus Mach II.. Poured from the bottle into a glass.. Black/brown appearance..  418 characters	4.57
2278	Black Gold	Black Gold had a phenomenal nose. It looks like a BA imperial stout should look and left a slight mocha-coloured ring around my goblet . The pour was medium thick - not motor oil thick. I wafted chocolate and vanilla and a strong barrel and boozy notes too. The taste follows much the same. This is a very barrel forward beer. The booze presence is strong but not overwhelming or off-putting because this is what you expect in a BA imperial stout. Chocolatey and laced with vanilla on the palate and a very sticky mouthfeel that keeps your lips together if you let some beer linger and warm in your mouth. Overall, as my dear friend, Amguerra305, and I concurred while sipping, this beer misses something and lacks the balance of a Bourbon County Brand Stout but it is, nonetheless, a very good BA stout.	4.41
2279	Black Gold	Pours a touch thin to what I am used to. Hardly any head with just a lingering dark khaki ring around the edge of the glass; slightest bit of light peeking through the edges. Smell is very booze and barrel forward with a hint of vanilla. Chocolate and roast on the back end. Taste is rather sweet up front followed by bourbon and oak on the back end. There also seems to be a hint of anise somewhere going on. The smell is definitely better than the the taste which is very good but not great. Feel is a tad carbonated yet light thick in body. Overall a very barrel forward beer that seems to lack something to bring it all together. Smell is spot on, taste needs something more; bourbon county esque with something missing.	4.41
2280	Black Gold	Yum. Dark chocolate, vanilla, charred oak, toasted marshmallow and coconut. Super dry and oaky. Lower sweetness balanced with bitterness and booze. Not even remotely cloying. Medium feel. Really good.	4.39
2281	Black Gold	"L: pours pitch black and thick. No head,
Lifeless
A: wow, smells up to hype. Big bourbon and fudge. Great aroma.
T: very nice. The barrel is rocking here, I oak, vanilla, chocolate, and nice bourbon. I would say, the bourbon could be smooth and richer. But this is still awesome!
F: very smooth, and great thickness, but not elite thickness."	4.64
2282	Black Gold	Thanks to elkhunter for scoring this for me, great guy to trade with, my CW connection.. Pours out like black gold indeed, used heavy viscosity black gold that is, Texas crude. Thin brown head. Aroma was huge on the oak and bourbon. The alcohol was definitely there.. Taste, wow, so much here. The alcohol is still rich, the roast is super heavy, the barrel aspect is over the top. I think I like the CW sweet spot with less age than this. I guess I'm saying there is a point of diminishing returns on barrel aging, the more you do it, the more angel's share, the more cost associated therewith, and the more barrel you get in the final product. This is still very good, but I think they went past the point of where it rocks. 36 months too much, I think one of the anniversary years was 24 months and that seemed a little nicer..  964 characters	3.77
2283	Black Gold	this is epic beer, its their anniversary stout aged an additional year in the bourbon barrels, three years total, and man is this mature. i am surprised that the barrel hasnt completely taken over the stout, i suppose its big enough to stand up, but i definitely expected it to be all bourbon. the roast and the chocolate in the stout are still very apparent, just incredibly mellow and well integrated now, cloaked in oak, and as robust as they ever were. profoundly flavorful beer, with heavy vanilla and wet oak, char, and a hint of root beer for whatever reason. dark fruit notes, chocolate syrup, and hot whiskey abound. i love the mouthfeel as much as anything, so huge and coating, syrupy but not too sugary, warming from the alcohol, comforting, lie a big hug on my insides, its wonderful stuff that seems to conjure images of the coldest darkest winter night and the coziest fire. central waters has done an amazing job with these barrel aged beers, especially the stouts, and this is the granddaddy of them all without question. apparently some variation year to year. this is all time! kind of the final evolution of the barrel aged imperial stout in my opinion.. edit: wow! this sure ages well. if you have a bottle of this vintage laying around, it might be time to pop it open, its drinking incredible about two years old!	4.49
2284	West Ashley	Sweet sour apricot nose on this one! Taste follows with a sour, tart apricot finish and swallow. The tartness lingers on tongue and grabs it. It has outstanding depth and decent feel.	4.29
2285	West Ashley	Pours a dense orange, quarter inch bubbly cap. Aroma is citrusy - I got my orange than apricot, though that is there as well. Palate has a great balance of tartness to the fruit notes - it isn’t super-lactic or puckering, but allows that orange & apricot to come through nicely with anchoring it with some tart funk. Finishes tart and crisp	4.69
2286	West Ashley	This bottle came to me by way of a BIF - I don't know exactly which batch it is, but the fruit is still rich and deeply present. The apricot notes are super ripe and pulpy. It's very sour, almost cheek-puckering. The fruit is still predominant, though the sourness is very forward. The pour is a lovely, light gold-yellow. It's just slightly transparent, more than you might expect of a saison.. Killer beer - it's tremendous. Thank you to my sender!	4.66
2287	West Ashley	Into a wine glass at a share. Amazingly clean. Soft nectarine and huge waves of apricot; everything from the pit to the flesh. Perfectly balanced tartness to compliment it.	4.53
2288	West Ashley	07/2015 - Amazing aromas of peach, apricot, acidic, funk; sweet, juicy, tart, peach, creamy flavors on the palate; funky, semisweet, millions of peaches all over the finish.	4.54
2289	West Ashley	A: Semi opaque peach, orange pour with pulsating yellow highlights. There’s some retention with miniscule lacing. S: Aroma has a musty, grainy-funk barrel presence with apricots, nectarines, lemons, grapes, and bright citrus: slightly vinous, rationally acidic, and moderately juicy. T: A restrained vibrant earthiness of the fresh cut grass, and approachable tartness. The notes sing to jammy apricots, pinot noir, grapes, peach, orange rind, oak, wood, and citrus.  709 characters	4.24
2290	West Ashley	Pours a cloudy orange colored beer with a medium white head, collapsing instantly.. Smells of ripe apricots, fresh cut flowers, lime zest and wet grass. Got a prominent mushroom funk quality to it, together with cream cheese and moldy earth.. Has a light, mellow mouthfeel with an uprising effervescence during the finish..  925 characters	3.86
2291	West Ashley	The beer pours a Clear yellow with a medium white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells apricots, apples, floral, fresh cut grass, and funk. It tastes very tart, with apricots, apples, floral, and funk. The body is medium with a dry finish. A great wild ale from Sante Adairus.	4.47
2292	West Ashley	Bottle is about 2.5 years old.. A: Orange tinted pale with fizzy white head that quickly disappears to nothingness.. S: Funky barnyard and earth alongside a good dose of tart apricot, earth, orange, and light oak..  685 characters	4.55
2293	West Ashley	Pours a nice peach amber color. Aroma is tart, funky and stone fruit. Flavor is fantastic. Nice tartness with stone fruit sweet and sour on the finish. Has a nice body and overall a delicious beer.	4.67
2294	West Ashley	"Pours pale hazy yellow, white thick frothy head.
Aroma has tons of apricots, sour lemon tart, hay,
Taste is lots of apricots, sour lemons, tart, raspberry, hay, little funk. Dry finish. Very drinkable"	4.46
2295	West Ashley	Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Mild sour fruity aroma. Taste is a moderate tart sour fruity that has little harshness at the end. A very pleasant sour.	4.44
2296	West Ashley	Frankly, this beer is too sour for me. However, taste, feel, and overall, I think thanks a great beer. When you taste this beer, you will taste a deep apricot funk	4.19
2297	West Ashley	Really hazy golden color with a bit of white foam. Aroma has lots of unripe apricots and lemony funk. Taste starts with tart, unripe apricots, stonefruit skin, acidic fruit juice, really dry finish. Light body, really dry, medium carbonation. Overall it's a great, fruity sour. Very refreshing and easy drinking.	4.5
2298	West Ashley	batch 12 (we think) drank on 4/2/2017 side by side Westly. Look - moderate head that disappeared fairly quick, fairly thick body, light orange / dark yellow color. Sexy. Smell / Taste- a lot of oak and interesting fruitiness to go with the apricot burst. That interesting fruitiness I not know is the pinor noir barrels because I thought this was just oak barrels. That definitely explains the complexity that really puts this beer on another level..  603 characters	4.68
2299	West Ashley	Had this on tap at the Churchills sour fest. Really nice bright color. Can smell the funk and the sour taste was great. The apricots weren't super strong but it was really sour.	4.52
2300	West Ashley	Bottle shared thanks to Maakun. Hazy pale golden with a white head. Notes of funk, minerals - salt, baking soda - peaches. Light tart and very complex. Medium body, medium carbonation and a tart, floral and fruity aftertaste.	4.5
2301	West Ashley	Color is hazy peach-orange with a minimal display of carbonation, maybe a thin blanket before dying to nothing.. Smell is tangerine, nectarine, and lemon--bright!. Taste is really tart grapefruit, tangelo, and cranberry. I have to say, it's so bright and tart, I think the apricot kind of gets drowned out by the work the microbes and oak are doing, unless these are particularly bright and citric apricots. It's not a bad thing though, this is pretty standout stuff..  523 characters	3.93
2302	West Ashley	It looks and it smells beautiful, but it missed the bull's eye I was expecting. It's still a very good apricot sour, but I'd take Fou Foune over this any day.	4.24
2303	West Ashley	"An overwhelming blast of apricot and oak up front. It's actually quite difficult to get past these two very distinctive aromas as they're very unapologetically in your face, but some subtle hints of lemon zest, barnyard funk, and milky caramel-like lactose surface with some time. Bretty notes of horseblanket and hay intensify as the brew gets even warmer.. Whether or not the SARA had this specific vision in mind, I think the beer itself is an embodiment of the Apricot as a whole, from the inside out, in terms of the flavor. Allow me to elaborate.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The first impression that the beer imparts on the tongue is mouth-puckeringly tart, as if you're sucking on a whole apricot pit by itself. Before there's any time to dwell on the sudden sour influx, a nice juicy apricot wave with a supporting cast of lactic acid and oak--this is the flesh of the apricot. The brew has a well-rounded sweet fruity finish, reminiscent of juicy nectarines, much like the sensation you get when you chew on the skin of the apricot.. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. The abundance of fruit in this beer really accentuates the creamy mouthfeel that SARA magically imparts upon their ales; at one point I could have sworn there was milkshake traveling down my throat as opposed to a very well-made American Wild Ale from a town that people from Santa Cruz go to when they need clothes that aren't hipster or from the Salvation Army, since Santa Cruz is adamantly reclusive about allowing corporations and non-local into the town."	4.8
2304	West Ashley	I'm not much for sours, but this was great. Not as tart as some other brews I've tried, which made it much more enjoyable fore me. Apricot came through well with that funk also.	4.26
2305	West Ashley	Batch 12. Consumed 9/12/16.. A: Hazy, vibrant, glowing gold/orange in the glass. This is a beautiful looking beer that looks like pure sunlight. Little to no head (a few medium soapy bubbles) on the pour, but a thin ring of tiny bubbles sits on the edge of the glass. A few wisps of lacing with some alcohol legs for sure.. S: Big musky funk character accompanied by HUGE tart apricot notes. More prevalent oaky pinot noir aroma fades as it warms, succumbing to the tart, juicy fruitiness. Bits of lemon and citrus, but nothing overly acidic..  1,769 characters	4.64
2306	West Ashley	On tap at the source in Capitola. To me, this was basically Saison Bernice with apricots added, aged in oak. It is a pleasant combo. You have the base saison adding a full body, nice carbonation / effervescent mouthfeel, slight funk, lacto. This one is quite tart, but I wouldn't call it sour. The apricot addition wasn't that apparent in the nose, but it did round off and pair with the base saison and oak flavors very well. I was surprised to find out that this was aged in a pinot noir barrel, because I didn't pick up any specific presence, just oak really. It goes down with a significant tart bite, leaving your mouth dry and aftertaste of tart lemon, oak, and hint of apricot. I really enjoyed drinking this and would happily have again. But, jesus it was a pain to get over here from the peninsula and unfortunately that means it will be a long while since I enjoy some SARA treats again. Sante!	4.36
2307	West Ashley	A 750ml bottle at Himmergiet with no discernible bottled on date on the bottle although the menu states that it was 2016. Poured into a mini wine glass.. Appearance: It poured a hazy golden straw colour with a minimal white head and sparse lacing.. Aroma: An initial whiff of something that reminded me of tuna salad followed by tart, apricot, berries, funk, grass and hay..  682 characters	4.6
2308	West Ashley	Batch 11 had at a share in July 2016. Lots of fruit on the nose and taste, lots of barnyard funk also. Carbonation and acidity were both spot on, very good sour.	4.5
2309	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	16 oz can from Tavour. Hazy, pale golden, spotty head. Aroma is big fruity notes, citrus, tropical. Yeasty, floral, fruity. Full body. Very smooth. Nice bitterness lingers.	3.93
2310	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Pours an opaque deep gold, with tons of floaties; white head, ok cap retention; solid ring; moderate lace with agitation. Strong dank orange and tangerine nose. Taste follows nose; weedy citrus/tropical fruit hops; sweet malt base; lite bitter hop bite; some onion as the liquid warms. Medium lite body; juicy feel; moderate carbonation; some hop astringency. Overall an excellent IPA; lite bitter linger; plenty of malt for balance; tasty juice hop flavors; would have scored a little higher if it didn’t look like a total snow globe.	4.59
2311	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	"16oz canned 8-6-19 and best before of 12-4-19, opened on 9-17-19.
1"" fluffy white head, good retention and sitting solid at 1/2"" even after several minutes. Opaque solid orange-yellow IPA.
Lots of fresh lacing clinging to all sides on the way down.
Ripe mango, oranges, pine, some initial pungent onion/garlic. Zesty. Green. Very intense aroma.
Flavors are a mix of citrus, weeds, tropical, vegetable - all on the zesty side, more bitterness than I expected - not sue why I expected a ""softer"" beer.
Medium to full body for the style, medium carbonation. Long finish full of the more green lean of the hop flavors here.
Different than I expected, intense flavors and aromas with more bitterness.
Good to very good."	4.02
2312	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Bradford's in Plymouth for about fourteen dollars. My 13th brew from these guys. Liked better than both regular Psuedo Sue, & Galaxy Dry Hopped, truly fantastic.	4.75
2313	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Canned 8/6/19. Despite the lower ABV this came across as heavier and less refreshing to me than Pseudo Sue. The Citrus is more robust also earthier and more bitter.. So I have tried all three Sue's that came to Pennsylvania. Is an extremely crowded IPA Market here, curious to see how they fare. If I can find it fresh I will certainly pick up pseudo Sue in the future since it is so tasty and reasonably priced.	4.26
2314	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Toppling Goliath landed in PA, so my first time trying this beer. I opted for the double dry hopped version of PS rather thant the regular version. Poured from a can into my DFH snifter glass.. L: A medium super hazy yellow gold color with a nice two finger white head. Decent glass lacing.. S: Unlike a lot of other reviewers, I'm getting a ton of dankness on the nose. Aromas of weed, onion, mint, vegetal notes mix with the citrus. A candy sweetness can be detected, but boy to me this is one dank smelling beer..  1,408 characters	4
2315	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	"World Class indeed! Easy drinking NEIPA and actually 6.8%abv according to the packaging! Still easily sessionable...per their website; ""This double dry hopped pale ale showcases the Citra hop for a well-balanced beer that is delicate in body with a mild bitterness in the finish. Ferocious aromas of Citrus and Mango give a refreshing taste that is bright with just enough bite."""	5
2316	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	16 ounce can dated August 6, 2019. Poured into Trillium Six States glass.. L: Pale gold with a hint of orange. Initial 1.5F head reduces to almost nothing, leaving not much trace. Hmm.... S: Largely tropical mango and papaya, very Citra in nature. Some earthiness..  589 characters	4.24
2317	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	From the can. The nose is papaya, mango, citrus with a touch of pine. The taste follows it well with a little more citrus presence than the nose suggested. A little bit sharp from the citrus, but it’s not bad. Carbonation is evident; soft and airy, leaving you burping.. Overall, it’s not the best thing ever but it’s a nice beer. The can doesn’t state the ABV, but if it really is only 5.8%, it’s got a fair amount of flavor and bite for something of such. My guess would be closer to 7-8% though.	4.06
2318	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	"16 oz can poured into a weizen glass.. Appearance
Hazed-out, cloudy blonde. 1/2 finger of creamy white head.. Nose
Passion fruit, mango, papaya, dank, wet florals, forest floor, and candy sugar..  566 characters"	4
2319	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	A knowing staff member of local beer store steered me toward this 4 pack. This tasting from a can dated 8/16/19. As a NEIPA fan this was a welcome introduction to this brewery. Really enjoyed to subtle grapefruit/orange notes, carbonation, and overall drinkability. Will seek this out more.	4.35
2320	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	L: Murky Straw-yellow hue with decent retention and lacing to last.. S: Citrus, Pineapple, and melons. T: Super citrus with hoppy backbone and earthy grassiness from the dry-hopping..  325 characters	4.42
2321	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	A hazy grapefruit colored brew.. Citrus and and grapefruit plus a good amount of zest in the aroma.. More citrus coats the tongue alongside fresh squeezed OJ, and a hint of grapefruit. Finishes faintly bitter..  425 characters	4.28
2322	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Bottled early May 2018; drank 6/3/18 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a big, bubbly off-white head; strong tree-rung lace..  346 characters	3.25
2323	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Aroma: Pinapple/Melon, Strong Citrus, with a hint of Ash smoke.. Color: Hazy Golden Straw with a two finger head that sits for a bit before dissolving into a light lacing around the edge of the glass.. Taste: Pleasant Citrus with a strong hoppiness that's rather pleasant, but not too overpowering. The dry hopping adds a nice lemongrass undertone to the final bits of the taste..  622 characters	4.45
2324	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	06/2016 - supremely creamy, nice hop character, and juicy on the nose fosho; balanced presence of Citra, with mango, peach, and pineapple coming through on the palate; smooth, mild bitter finish.	4.48
2325	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Poured into a snifter. Hazy bright golden color with a modest white head. Some fairly big floaters. Big aromas of pineapple, tangerine, and faint resin pine. The taste was fairly bitter with a tropical quality, balanced with grass, and faint resin. Medium bodied and carbed. Easy to see why this is hyped.	4.32
2326	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	On draft. I actually think I prefer regular Pseudo Sue. I have had that beer several times and am usually quite happy with it. This one was also quite tasty but I think some of the nuanced elements found in the original are lost here.	4.09
2327	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Poured from an undated bomber, a hazy pale Orange with a white head and some lacing. Citrus rind aroma, taste has some citrus, malts and hops. Very smooth, flavorful easy drinker. I'd really like to see this in cans.	4.27
2328	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	On tap. Poured a clear, golden amber color with a small, khaki-colored head of foam. It smelled of orange peel, grapefruit and pine. Sweet tropical fruits with piney bitterness and toasted caramel.	4.69
2329	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	"**
06/29/18. Bottle to tasting glass. Thanks to DC for sharing. We are guessing about 2 months old.. Slightly hazy yellow. Solid white head. Good retention..  374 characters"	4.37
2330	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	As a Chicago boy, Sue the Tyrannosaurus Rex sold it fore me. Even had she not been on the bottle, I would have to say this beer is quite fantastic.. It has a beautiful golden color that lightens on the edges, and with a good pour leaves a perfect amount of head.. The smell wasn't too pleasant for me, as smelled a bit dank for my liking, but the taste more than made up for it. There is a slight remainder of the smell, but the beer itself is beautifully balanced and easy to drink. At 5.5% alcohol, it's not too strong, but it builds a lot of character and flavor from the first sip..  1,019 characters	4.19
2331	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	Usually don’t write reviews but toppling Goliath in general has amazed me on my trips to Iowa. This beer is excellent, golden straw color, very little head, pineapple-celery-lemongrass aroma. Just delicious taste, clean bitterness. No off tastes. From a pint glass poured from a 1 month old 22oz bomber. Would drink every day.	4.73
2332	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	220z bottle undated purchased at Moonshine. Citrusy nose of orange and grapefruit. Hazy orange color. Orange flavor comes through with a grapefruit background and a hint of peach sweetness. Flavors are very balanced. Another very enjoyable beer from TG.	4.58
2333	Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped	"Poured from 22 oz bottle into shaker pint glass.
A: Pours a cloudy orange-yellow hue with 2 inch frothy white foam head with excellent retention. Simply beautiful.
S: Bright orange, grapefruit, and musky pine notes (Citra!).
T: Strong orange, pine, and grapefruit notes with a hint of dry cracker malt. With warming, notes of juicy peach and mango emerge.
M: Light-medium body. Juicy fruit, moderately bitter hops, and a musky pine note. The bitter and musky notes linger into the finish more than the sweeter notes...small bummer.
D: Love the citra impact. A very nice variant of Pseudo Sue!"	4.43
2334	Trappistes Rochefort 10	From notes 12/29/11: Pours a dark, cloudy reddish brown. The pour produces a single finger of beige, dense, short-lived head which leaves minimal lacing as it recedes. Aroma is vinous with notes of red grape, dark fruits, bubblegum, brown sugar, alcohol and very mild floral hops. Taste is very complex: dark malt and sugar, clove, banana, figs raisins, dark cherries, honey, molasses and faint chocolate; pepper and alcohol in the finish; alcohol intensifies in the aftertaste. With that let me say that the alcohol is superbly well hidden for an 11.3% ABV beer. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy and a delight to the mouth. A pure delight.	4.47
2335	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Smells of plum and chocolate, poured a frothy beige head. Cloudy and dark, mocha undertones are most apparent after sipping, while also minimally nutty. Good amount of sediment at the bottom of the pour, some rising to the top. Delicious complex flavor that changes throughout the sip.	4.8
2336	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Pours perfect dark with thick frothy foam and deep notes of fig andchocolate. Tootsie roll in a glass l, pure classic beauty. Lingers on the pallete with love. Oak and chocolate.	4.9
2337	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"This is the first beer I've ever had where it smacked me in the mouth with a WOW!!! My fav. beer. Weirdly the ""8"" is more to my liking but they're both phenomenal."	5
2338	Trappistes Rochefort 10	11.2oz bottle bb 11.09.2023 (presumably one year old) poured into Trappist Rochefort chalice at just above fridge temp 11.3% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown in color with a never ending tan colored head building in the center from the nucleated glass. Fairly complete lacing and excellent retention. The aroma is faint with dark fruit and brown sugar. The taste is rich Belgian malt & candi sugar with a not quite tart cherry/dark fruit overtone. The finish is moderately bitter and fairly dry, balancing the initial heavy malt presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. No hint of 11.3% ABV in the taste or aroma. Overall, very good. An absolute classic and absolutely well made, but the taste and aroma are lacking in this bottle. I guess I'll buy a few more and sample as we approach 2023 to see if it's more to my liking.	4.4
2339	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"In the first place i don't go very well with this beer because of some mistakes i made.. First of all is one special beer and you must drink it right.. On the back has some notes to how drink this beer. It says the drinking temperatures and also the right class..
In the first time i drink it very cold and that was a huge mistake. Also with some wrong class. This beer is very heavy and rich and if you drink it cold, then she hit you very hard in your mouth.. I remember how punchy was in my month when i drink it cold. So make sure to drink it at 12-14 Temperatures and not at 3-4 like some german beers.
After i fix my mistakes i try again and finally i can see the whole beauty and all the good ratings here.. This beer is really very special and unique.. Has one very weird taste and it flow very different in your mouth.. Your tongue embrace the beer with whole mouth and give yous a bitter and at the same time sweet taste.. You feel caramel, coffe, chocolate in the bitter way... Remind me little bit one of my favorites beers the ""La trappe Quadrupel"" but with the stronger way. And yes this beer is smooth but also very very strong.. She is very serious and you must prepare for it.. You must eat before drink it and also show some respect.. Drink it with the right way and she don't disappoint you in the end..
Overall one of the most balance beers out there for sure.. Very strong, very weird but also very special.."	4.36
2340	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Pours and smells like an Egyptian dreaming of a pyramid - like, I’m talking about perfection. Taste though, you know, I want to tell you, but I, I think... and it’s just that. I am lingering on the idea that this is not perfection as I expected. It’s a hell of a beer, like Spielberg has had a hell of a career. That being said, even the best are not without their (not duds) but just good, not great works. And when I sip on this, I am content like a kitten drinking milk, but I’m not in heaven. Ya feel me?. Life is beautiful. Live it.	4.23
2341	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Wow, first time i see the beer rated 100. I would rate 4/5 or 90/100. (it seems to me i had better 4rupel in my experience). No matter, im sure every beer geek praise it fair.	4.46
2342	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Pours mahogany. Has a very fine head, great lacing. Is very potent, very powerful. Notes of chocolate, raisin, fig, vanilla, malt, dark fruit. Rich., smooth, multidimensional in flavor, complex in the Belgian Quad manner. Mouthfeel never goes anything but smooth and rich, but demands to be savored slowly. The best of Abbey ale flavor and complex notes. Sad when you drink your last one. Never dull, always remembered fondly. 5 all the way, no other rating will do for this style. A reference in Belgian Trappist Ales.	5
2343	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Pours a very deep, dark mahogany, almost black, coloration with a large, foamy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, toffee and dark fruits, with just a hint of chocolate, licorice and estery spice. Taste is a complex balance of rich, bready, caramel malt, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, dark fruits: raisin, fig, plum, with lighter notes of chocolate, licorice and just a hint of vanilla and clove. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some caramel malt, dark fruits, licorice and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.. Quite a rich and complex Quad that still manages a good balance of sweet and bitter notes, even though leaning a little towards sweet and boozy as it warms. Really not too bad for the style though and there really is an impressive depth of flavor and complexity here.	4.35
2344	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Poured into snifter. Deep brown with a hint of red. One finger tan head. Nose of vanilla, caramel and dark fruit with a punch of booze. Taste followed the nose with the standard Belgian sweetness. High carbonation and medium light body. This is a delightful sipper.	4.35
2345	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Incredible brown color and rocky, uneven head. Beautiful mix of scents including chocolate, spices, alcohol, and grain. Tastes just as astonishing as it smells only with a slight bitterness and delicacy. The fourth and fifth sips are gorgeously smooth.	4.87
2346	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"Look: people keep saying ""reddish brown"", but it's really mostly brown. Sediment at bottom. Smell: Spicy vanilla alcohol. Almost hints of rum, which makes sense given the fruity tastes that will come. I drank this right after a Bernadus Abt 12, and the alcohol fumes are much more present. Like trying to get drunk off of vanilla extract. It smells like it's going to be super boozy and a struggle to drink, which luckily isn't born out by the taste. Also: spice.. Taste: Oak, vanilla, cream, leather, raisins, chocolate/Guinness, molasses. Rye bread. Spice..  764 characters"	3.7
2347	Trappistes Rochefort 10	BB 8/11/2021. Just about 3 year old bottle - sweet, rich slow-sipper. Caramel, toasty, roasty, malty, brown sugar blended with all kinds of dark fruits. The highlight is the med/full, very smooth feel. A terrific beer that's worth it.	4.48
2348	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Pours chestnut with garnet highlights, topped by nearly an inch of coarse, khaki froth. Muted aroma smells of raisins, caramel, apples, alcohol, and perhaps the barest whiff of nutmeg or other indeterminate spices. Shimmering swaths of lacing coat the glass as the beer recedes.. Big time flavor up front features toasted bread, raisins, caramel, nutmeg, warming alcohol, and perhaps even some allspice. Everything is nicely balanced and melds beautifully into a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Belgian yeast lends the obligatory character. Warming reveals notes of apple and cherry cough syrup. Medium-heavy body and fine, vivacious carbonation make for a lush, vigorous mouthfeel that supports the bold flavor profile with aplomb, while the dry finish resets the palate brilliantly.. While I wasn't blown away by the other Rocheforts in the series, this bad boy brings it big time. It manages to come off as refreshing and vital even as it flaunts its bold, complex flavor profile. While not especially distinctive in any particular regard, there's no denying this is brilliantly executed from top to bottom.	4.15
2349	Trappistes Rochefort 10	What can I say other than, this is my all time favorite beer. The smell and taste are wonderful, I love the dark fruits! I’m still new to reviewing beer but I can say without a doubt this is top notch quality. The price is a little high but worth every penny. I recently bought a chalice just for this beer. It’s not too hard to find here in MN, but it sells quickly at my local shop.	5
2350	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"""Best before November 2023""; drank 6/17/19 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque brown/orange appearance.. An even pour yielded a nice khaki head; a thick curtain of lace..  384 characters"	4.34
2351	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"330 mL Bottle. ABV 11.7%.
Appearance: Dark brown, One finger of light tan head, Visible sediment, Good retention, Thin cap remains.
Aroma: Red grapes, Prune, Blueberry, Spicy yeast, Slight cherry, Slight raisin, Hint of alcohol warmth.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, Smooth, Alcohol warmth.
Flavour: Prune, Blueberry, Plum.
Overall: Fantastic quad with wonderful dark fruit character. I will definitely be enjoying this again."	4.48
2352	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Best by 11-09-2023. Deep cloudy mahogany pour, cream top, good retention, spotty lacing. Toffee, butterscotch, molasses, raisin, dark bread, apricot, hints of chocolate and coffee, cigar, cognac, leather, belgian yeast, peppery spices.	4.59
2353	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"Mahogany with ruby highlights at the ends. Thick off-white mousse with awesome staying power and web-like lace. Absolutely beautiful!
Aromas of dried figs, prunes, raisins, dried cherries, a mix of armagnac and calvados.
Heady flavors follow the aroma. A bit more fruitcake going on. A touch boozy.
Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect from a beer of this ABV.
A dang good nightcap!"	4.39
2354	Trappistes Rochefort 10	When I first tried this it knocked my socks off. Then... after many brews of different styles I came back to it over and over. Hmm is it that good? Is it original? I've come to conclude that if Quads are not your style try it once. TR#10 is pretty good for style. If quads are your thing also try it once. After that you decide. Repeat years later. I've had so many bad quads that this is refreshing, but it is also not as life-changing as I thought my first time.	3.77
2355	Trappistes Rochefort 10	"L- I'm not sure if I should have held up to the light. This bottle has rested immobile for two days, and poured carefully but it's poured with clumps of yeast sediment, now floating up and down. Otherwise it's very deep chestnut and cloudy. It poured with a fine 2cm pale tan head, topped with a small dollop of dark brown residue - more sediment. I realise the need to be bottle conditioned to get a beer like this, but just mention it as a caution to others who might wish to rest this really well, and pour reeeally slowly.
S- Toasty dark brown mollasses-rich (muscovado) sugar, with liquorish notes from the 11.3%ABV.
T- Deep, toffeeish, with some hints of coffee. Wow, it's a deep toasty rich caramel kind of toffee.
F- Rich, deep+dark - think British Xmas pudding with all it's pungent dark fruit, doused with lashings of rum.
O- Wow, this is quite something; it's not often I get to sample such impactful beers. Good job it's a small bottle as it's that intense I don't think I'd want nor enjoy more than one at a sitting... ...that said now nearing the bottom, my arm could be twisted...
Bought from: Real Ale Limited, 97 Goldborne Road, London W10, for the eye-watering price of £5.90/330ml bottle. And no I hadn't seen the price when I put it in my basket.
BB: 11/12/2023"	4.36
2356	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Poured into a Tulip chilled from a 12 oz. bottle.. L: Beautiful dark amber with a slight bit of cloud. Hard to tell because you only get the color around the very edges as the light shines through. Two fingers of very thick, slightly rocky, head that dissipates slowly and leaves an absolutely gorgeous lacing that retains.. S: Dark sugar, malt, slight yeast, banana, and a bit of raisin/plum in there..  1,321 characters	4.61
2357	Trappistes Rochefort 10	Dark brown in color with a murky complexion. There's a fingernail of beige around two thirds of the rim and covering about half of the top. The aroma is of dark Belgian candy sugar and sweet, light malt. I'm tasting very sweet light Belgian malt, dark Belgian candy sugar, caramel, and marzipan. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and offers a light warmth from the alcohol.	4.09
2358	Trappistes Rochefort 10	holy crap. alcohol almost undetectable at 11.3% abv. dark caramel, raisins, bread, figs, vanilla. well carbonated but head recedes quickly. warming. almost has an oak aged character to it. can’t believe it’s held up this well. has been refrigerated for most of the time.	4.24
2359	A Deal With The Devil	05/2015 - Love the huge cognac aromas, raisin and plum, a slight maple, subtle hoppy aromas; sweet, honey, boozy, caramel, dank hops, and more plum and some tobacco too; chewy mouthfeel with flavors of raisin, tobacco, dark chocolate, and cognac lingering.	4.74
2360	A Deal With The Devil	Massive caramel and vanilla. Plenty of barrel. Not at all hot for the ABV. Creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Long, sweet finish. 2014 vintage, cognac seems to have fallen off a bit. Just a fantastic sipper!	4.78
2361	A Deal With The Devil	This is absolutely the most perfect barleywine that I have ever tasted. If it wasn’t so expensive I would probably drink nothing but this all winter. Barleywine is life!	5
2362	A Deal With The Devil	I'll begin this review by stating that I am not a barleywine guy. Revoke my membership to BiL, because I'm not worthy.. But, Jesus, if you don't like this beer, your Craft is Life membership should be revoked.. A Deal with the Devil (Double Oak) has a strong caramel nose - tasting notes include rich caramel, quite a lot of barrel, a bit of malt, chocolate notes, and a lot of richness. It's quite sweet, but with the balance of the barrels, it's very drinkable and finishes quite cleanly..  566 characters	4.74
2363	A Deal With The Devil	Christmas tasting, lineup of all variants. Base beer comes off as very similar to the Woodford, a bit more fruity perhaps. Plums, raisins. Sweet and boozy.	4.05
2364	A Deal With The Devil	"Batch 2
Dark brown with reddish highlights, almost no head.
Huge nose of booze, candi sugar, dark dried fruits (plums, dates, raisins).
Medium sweetness, barley sugar, malty, dried fruits.
Way too heavy for me to handle it at the head of a tasting, couldn't finish my glass, too maderized."	3.97
2365	A Deal With The Devil	Batch 2 bottle. Poured from a 750mL bottle into an Anchorage Teku glass. Thanks Ray for sharing.. Pours a dark brown body with an off white two finger head that reduces rather quickly to leave a ring of retention.. Aromas are sweet and malty, molasses, cognac and toffee dominate. On the tongue its roasty and sweet, butterscotch candy and molasses, bourbon soaked vanilla beans, french vanilla, more vanilla than other barleywines I've tasted which is a nice touch. Aftertaste is toasted malt and sticky dark fruits. Mouthfeel is rich, heavy, low carbonation..  599 characters	4.64
2366	A Deal With The Devil	2014 bottle poured in a stemmed bulb. Pours brownish red in color. Minimal head that fades quick. Aromas of dates, raisins, plums and booze. Taste is exactly as the aroma. Sweet dark fruits that hit the tongue on the front. Some booze burn. Finish doesn’t linger. Feel is medium bodied for the style. Overall, this is an amazing beer. I’m starting to enjoy barleywines more and this one is near the top of my list.	4.6
2367	A Deal With The Devil	"Batch 2
A- Brown with ting of read
S- Syrup - dark brown sugar, oak, and molasis
T- Follows nose with sweet barrel aged brown sugar and molasis with a bit of aged hops
F- Thick-medium
O- I don't love barleywines, but this was nice and drinkable."	4.47
2368	A Deal With The Devil	Perhaps the best beer I've ever had in my life.. A step above some of the big hitters like BCBBW.. Sampler out of bottle..  156 characters	4.98
2369	A Deal With The Devil	Vintage 2014.. Pours translucent rust, dark copper with a khaki head that eventually disappears completely leaving no lace. The smell is of stone fruit, caramel and cognac. The taste is sweet and complex with caramel, toffee, vanilla, dates, burnt sugar, raisin and toasted bread. Full texture with low carbonation. Admittedly sweet but, so many different flavors blending together in glorious harmony. Instantly one of my all-time favorites.	4.9
2370	A Deal With The Devil	"Batch 4. L: pours very thick and dark brown syrup. A film of head for a brief moment then fades to a tiny ring about the glass.
S: big sweet cognac, caramel covered raisins, there is some slight bitterness. Overall it smells big, boozy and sweet.
T: wow! Zero alcohol, wow. Wasn't expecting that. Huge and awesome flavors of sweet raisins, grapes, with nice caramel sweetness that lingers well past the drink.
F: The sweetness completely coats my mouth and lips. I just keep tasting it long after the drink. So smooth, very thick.
O: wow! Blown away!!"	4.94
2371	A Deal With The Devil	"Batch 2, pours brown into the glass, not overly thick, small lighter brown head on the top, 1/5"". Aroma and appearance both look and smell like cognac. Massive amount of fusel like alcohol waft from the glass. Wow, this is just like smelling rubbing alcohol.. Taste, man the alcohol is the dominant thing going on. A little bit of french oak like notes from the cognac barrel up the senses and probably get the alcohol burn pairing with a drier astringency, thereby totally dominating the mouth in a non consensual way. It just burns the entire way through. Some toffee aspect to it, but it still tastes like burning. At this point, I just have to reconcile the harsh fact that I don't like anything aged in a cognac barrel, Eclipse cognac masterpiece or whatever was limited for the same reasons. Or maybe cognac barrel aging just needs to be for far less time to contour itself to my palate limitations. A lot of raisin bitterness too, despite a very mild set of carbonation and decent amount of sweetness (coming from where, I don't know) to it.. I like so much Anchorage stuff, but this is my least favorite of anything they make, no doubt because of the heavy amount of Cognac influence."	2.93
2372	A Deal With The Devil	Batch 2. Poured form bottle into snifter. Dark amber color. Nose is caramel, cognac and raisins. The taste follows he nose. The cognac blends so perfectly here. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth. Overall this is the best barelywine I have had the opportunity to enjoy.	4.99
2373	A Deal With The Devil	This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was dark brown color with a slim one finger white to slight off white somewhat foamy head that dissipated within a light lacing. The smell was full of sweet darkened caramel boozy malt. The taste had a full boozy sweet caramel malty flavor. There is a slight boozy sweet caramel aftertaste that lead to sweet yet dry finish. On the palate, this sat about a medium to heavy on the body. I don’t mind the thickness on this beer - it’s a barleywine, it’s supposed to be this way. Boy, does this super smooth over my tongue. Overall, well, Gabe Fletcher, yeah dude, you knocked this one outa the park.	4.6
2374	A Deal With The Devil	Pours a lively mahogany hue with thin, tight, off-white band around the edges. Nose expresses smokey notes, molasses and brown sugar. Taste follows nose - sweet and cloying, but not in a bad way in theses circumstances and the cognac barrel (wood and spirits) comes forth in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium in body with an almost still carbonation and an oily texture. Overall, nothing short of amazing. I just wish the price point wasn't so dear.	4.22
2375	A Deal With The Devil	Had 2014 version aged for 2 years 4 months. Very smooth and lots of taste. Had a smooth cognac barrel taste with no heat to it. Compares well to MOAS. Had a debate over which was better. Think I prefer Moas by a hair though I'd have to side by side to be sure.	4.45
2376	A Deal With The Devil	I am not always a big fan of barleywines, but this one absolutely knocked my socks off. Everything about this big boy is, paradoxically, in your face, and yet, very nuanced. Lots of candied molasses, toffee, caramel, drambuie, cognac, orange and lemon zest, kiwi, strawberry, dates, vanilla, oak, and even a touch of the kind of tartness one might find in a world class lambic. I paid around fifty for this bottle of Batch #1, and I've seen them selling on the internet for at least twice that (and it would still been well worth the experience.	5
2377	A Deal With The Devil	Batch 2, 2014 bottling poured into a snifter appears a dark chestnut color with a khaki head that fades leaving stringy lace.. Aroma is vinous, raisony, caramel, molasses, oak and herbal hops. Little sherry accent as it breathes.. Taste is sweet with caramel, vanilla, molasses, slight oak, vinous and herbal. Boozy as it warms but yet remains quite sweet throughout..  694 characters	4.23
2378	A Deal With The Devil	Dark maroon with suppressed fizz trying to slowly rise from the deep, like an orc snuffed out in the dark, leaving some tan bubbles as evidence. Thick, sticky clear legs appear after a swirl.. Smell is deep charred oak, cutting and bright red grape, smoothing almond paste and smoked walnut, with leather, a dash of black pepper, a hint of raspberry, and cigar ash. So far there is a shocking lack of prune element. As it warms I get an added and welcome development of toasted biscuits and maple sugar candy.. Oh holy cow, the flavor is really rich but balanced with a wonderful body--a fizz that just barely surfaces on the palate with a nice, moderate to thick body..  1,594 characters	4.28
2379	A Deal With The Devil	A deal with the devil b2. Pours a dark ember red-brown colored beer, together with a slowly uprising bubbly, beige head, which then disappears all too soon. After swirling the beer, its thickness becomes obvious at the glass, revealing slick alcohol legs, reminding me of drinking a Whiskey.. Complex on the nose, not defined by an overly present barrel though. A vivid, multi layered fruit note mingles perfectly into caramel malts, evoking dried plums, raisins, fermenting grapes and red apples. A toasty nut quality sets itself atop of the malts, soothed by a flowery note. Way lighter on the nose than its abv indicates, due to its awesome balance..  1,631 characters	4.75
2380	A Deal With The Devil	Finally cracked this one after holding onto it for awhile. 2014 vintage so about two years on it.. I am finding I am not as big of a fan of barleywines anymore so maybe I didn't like this as much as I would have a few years ago. That said, this was a smooth, decadent treat that almost could serve as an after dinner drink. It was very sweet and balanced. Any hop presence had died out and the barrel character had combined nicely with the malt profile. Drinking a full bomber would have been too much so I was glad to share this on Thanksgiving Day.	4.28
2381	A Deal With The Devil	Wow, what an amazing barleywine. Probably my favorite barley wine. Such a nice sweet taste to this and so complex. I really can't believe how smooth this was for being such a high alcohol beer. Please try this if you can. It is really really good.	4.89
2382	A Deal With The Devil	A: Pours dark with minimal head. S: Sweet sugar, figs, raisins, and liquor. T: A burst of sugary, raisin filled sweetness, rounded out by the cognac barrel..  254 characters	4.71
2383	A Deal With The Devil	Dec 2014 (batch 2) bottle, opened Aug 2016.. A - Slighly murky mahogany body. Light tan head pours a half finger high with ok retention and lace.. S - Apple brandy, caramel, Pumpernickle, port wine, and molasses..  451 characters	4.24
2384	§ucaba	Bottled 1/9/13; drank 12/17/15 @ California Split.. Opaque red/brown rust appearance.. Minimal khaki head; minimal lace..  295 characters	4.42
2385	§ucaba	i'll first say it outright... F-W is the brewer i hate to love. i'm reduced to having to travel a bit, or capitalize on business trips south-of-my-border, to accrue product ... and oh those overly-precious individually-boxed bottles... of which i usually keep a full case piecemeal-ed, stocked and stored in the (guarded) cellar.. Moving right along... largely translucent rusty-bourbonish hue in the clear glass when held to the light... a syrupy, woody whiff of the snifter (to simplify impressions)... and then for that swish and swallow... a tad boozy, syrupy, burnished, caramel popcorn... finish only causes cravings, and the realization begins to set in that life is fleeting, as is this glass reaches its bottom. and no refill.	4.5
2386	§ucaba	Pours deep dark brown with fluffy white head. Snappy bite and bold hop - really nice for a barley wine. Boozy double barrel oak with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toasted coconut.	4.64
2387	§ucaba	"I love this beer for its taste, particularly the ""candi sugar"" aspect. This beer has joined my small circle of favorites. While the style is officially listed as ""British Barleywine"", the taste is very similar IMO to a good barrel-aged quad, like the Weyerbacher ""Blasphemy"". It is frustrating that barrel-aged quads seem hard to find where I live (Connecticut)."	4.65
2388	§ucaba	A - Pours a dark brown with a reddish tint. The one finger creamy white head leaves a decent amount of soapy lacing.. S - Aroma is caramel, toffee, raisins and bourbon.. T - The taste is raisins, plums, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, oak and bourbon..  454 characters	4.47
2389	§ucaba	Pours a murky, very dark brown with low, tan head.. Smell is sweet with notes of raisins, dried fruit, mulled wine, oak, vanilla, cocoa and brown sugar. Strong, but slightly busy.. Taste is rich and spicy, with notes all over the place, oak, vanilla, dried fruit, mulled wine, cocoa, leather. A bit of bitterness on the finish, along with some coffee grounds. Drinks like a half and half of barley wine and a quad, aged in oak..  564 characters	4.17
2390	§ucaba	Bottled Jan. 2019. Pours dark brown-red, almost black, with a persistent ring of cream-colored head.. The nose is fig, prune, cherry, chocolate, coffee...This is one of those beers where you could list 10+ notes and not be bullshitting. There's a lot going on here. Mostly dark fruit, mocha, and rich bourbon/leather..  810 characters	4.59
2391	§ucaba	Pours sharp and dark mahogany. Plum highlights glow in a crisp, clear way from an Offero oversized wine glass. A thin, fine, chestnut head lasts a couple of minutes before becoming a veil and a ring. Spotty lace washes up and down as a film clings but never seems to settle.. Rich and earthy raisins are punctuated by short bursts of brown sugar. Pumpernickle bread and leather give this an aroma of what I imagine a 19th Century English drawing room might smell like.. The sweet/bitter balance is tilted towards the sweetness with occasional spikes in bitterness. It generally follows the aroma with added notes of coal. The alcohol presents similar to whiskey, though very subtle. The finish is long and sweet. Warmth brings out a strong sense of licorice..  1,276 characters	4.49
2392	§ucaba	Dark brown filtered, with moderate carbonation and 1.5 fingers of yellowish beige head.. Smells of scotch, bourbon, stinky foot, coconut, molasses, and caramel.. Tastes of coconut, bourbon, dark chocolate, and brown sugar..  439 characters	4.41
2393	§ucaba	2018 version purchased at the brewery. Ruby brown/dark brown pour at 59 degrees; tight beige head; good cap retention; medium heavy lacing turns to soapy spots; medium legs. Sweet caramel malt, jam preserves and a scant amount of bourbon on the nose. Flavors follow nose - sweet caramel malt, jam, bourbon, with layers of bitter earthy hops, oak, toffee, tobacco, leather, chocolate, dried fruit, marmalade; some barrel notes with bourbon, brown sugar aftertaste. Smooth lite velvety tongue coating; moderate minus carbonation; dry finish; medium almost full body; some warmth from 12.5%. Overall, great balance between sweet malt/molasses and bitter hops; medium fruity linger; dangerously easy drinking for ABV; an absolutely fantastic BABW!	4.84
2394	§ucaba	"The label on the front says ""2019"" but there does not seem to be a specific date code. The label also claims ""11.3% ALC./VOL."". Appearance: The body is a very dark mahogany brown with good clarity and hints of very dark brown and reddish-brown at the edges as light comes through. The head is a light off-khaki color with a hint of tobacco stained yellow. There isn't much head retention and it fades quickly to a ring and a raft.. Aroma: The beer has a lot of caramel aroma which pushes through and is joined by a bit of wet wood. There is some alcohol that comes through. Oddly it smells a bit cheesy but the alcohol and wood characters come through a bit stronger..  1,511 characters"	3.53
2395	§ucaba	Beer dinner at Ron’s Corner Tavern and it’s the king of the hill. A glazed sweet pork chop with potatoes, carrots and apple chipotle. The Sucaba is just like killer with this pairing. AWESOME SAUCE!	4.28
2396	§ucaba	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a high sided tulip glass.. Look is a dark cola colored with little to no head.. Aroma is bourbon barrel with a strong candy malt..  234 characters	4.83
2397	§ucaba	"2019 bottle:
L - Deep, opaque brown with ruby highlights along with a medium tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind minimal lacing.
S - Tons of sweet, rich bourbon and oak up front as well as rich malt, caramel, and vanilla
T - Complex: Sweet, rich, boozy bourbon up front along with rich, smoky oak and malt followed by notes of sweet chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and dark fruits
F - Medium to full bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation. Sticky and chewy
O - A truly fantastic barelywine aged in bourbon barrels - the bourbon barrel aging adds to the overall complexity"	4.55
2398	§ucaba	Sucaba 2015. Ruby Amber clean look. Almost no head as style. Syrupy legs like dessert wine on glass.. Bourbon vanilla oak nose, malty sweetness..  497 characters	4.21
2399	§ucaba	"12oz bottle. 2019 vintage, No. 008. Presented in individual box. 6000 cases produced.
Clear, ruby brown colored body. Slight tan head, but this sticks around as active surface island and ring. Leaves behind a few spots of lacing.
Aroma is rich with toffee/caramel, dark fruit, oak bourbon barrel and vanilla.
Taste is well balanced with dark fruit (dark cherry, prune, fig), with a blend of toffee/caramel/molasses, and the contribution of the oak bourbon barrel which includes vanilla. There is also a slight chocolate note. Slightly more sweet than bitter.
Thicker mouth feel, with a mouth coating texture. Good supportive carbonation.
A terrific beer in all aspects, including an approachable package size. Definitely deserving of its world class ratings."	4.59
2400	§ucaba	"12oz bottle into Tulip
2018 vintage (cellared for 1 year)
Pours a darkish brown with amber hues, off white head
Caramel, toffee, dark fruit, oak, booze
Taste is bittersweet caramel toffee, coffee, heavy dark fruit, oak, leather, vanilla, slight hop bitterness, with a long and mellow finish
Feel is medium bodied average carbonation no alcohol fusels
Overall this is by far and away the best beer I've ever had, perfectly balanced, aroma that has depth, and a never ending finish."	4.93
2401	§ucaba	Firestone Walker's Sucaba is a really delicious Barley Wine. I had the 2019 version and I was blown away. Smooth, tasty, and sweet.. Look: dark brown with a fairly thick soft and fluffy tan head. Aroma: Vanilla, toffee, bourbon.  419 characters	4.51
2402	§ucaba	L: Pours a slightly muddy brown color with a few hints of mahogany red, with a very small tan head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing.. S: Sweet smell, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, mixes with some booze and vanilla, a bit of roast and toast.. T: Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, brown sugar, notes of the bourbon and booze, with notes of vanilla..  459 characters	4.22
2403	§ucaba	2019 bottle, 11.3% abv and a stupid cardboard box thats been taking up my fridge. poured into a tulip a dark brown, only some ruby notes separating it from a black void, with a tan fizzy head that slipped down to a nice ring, lots of little legs and spots. nose is a big blend of brown sugar, caramel, toffee and booze. It's sweet but very subdued. taste follows with a starting brown sugar, caramel and molasses sweetness that slowly turns into bits of vanilla and a booze warmth. full-bodied and nice to drink with a bit of warming lingers for a minute, which is nice to contrast just how subdued everything is here. would like to find another to let sit for a year or two, really glad i decided to clean the fridge.	4.46
2404	§ucaba	2018 edition. Dark mahogany color, puny tan head. Sweet aroma, brown sugar & caramel. Tastes sweet but not excessive. Very nice flavor: brown sugar, caramel, bourbon, barrel flavors with char being almost Smokey & a boozy finish. Medium body with just barely enough carbonation. Overall, it’s delicious!	4.45
2405	§ucaba	2011 Abacus. Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Slightly hazed mahogany pour with 1 finger of fizzy white head. Nice ring of lacing.. S: Caramel and toffee.. sweet and boozy..  676 characters	4.4
2406	§ucaba	"2018 bottle
Pours a dark brown with a finger of head that dissipated quickly.
Taste and smell are bourbon, toffee, caramel, some coconut and dark fruits.
Super smooth and creamy.
Excellent barleywine!"	4.49
2407	§ucaba	2013. Poured with rich, full head that slowly dissipated. Mild to medium toffee, brown sugar nose with some BA noticeable. Taste is incredibly mellow and well-balanced. Unlike Bigfoot, I don't know if I'd age this any longer - although I am comparing a BA version to a non BA. Mouthfeel is amazing with creamy body. Very good beer but I was hoping for a little bit more edginess in the taste and feel. Not a knock for an amazingly mellow beer. A bit of residual sweetness in the finish.	4.42
2408	§ucaba	"L: deep dark brown under a 1"" white cap with fair to poor retention. S: big alcohol smell, bourbon, coconut, dark sugars, caramel, dark dried fruit, and rich malts. T: dark dried fruit, molasses, brown sugar, traces of coconut, and a balancing bitter on the finish.  348 characters"	4.5
2409	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Bomber from Albertsons. Pours out jet black, thin beige head disappears. Nose is bit confusing, as there is so much going on. Taste brings it all together, Mexican chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, barrel notes and a bit of warmth from the alcohol. Sweet and ashy.	3.95
2410	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2018 release. Poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Dark dark brown in colour with a thin brown head that although thin, stuck around, while leaving some nice spotty lacing.. Aroma: Roasty, coffee, cacao, caramel, toffee, bourbon, oak and cinnamon..  656 characters	4.61
2411	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	From a bomber into a PAA Dino glass, this beer pours out with streams of dark brown, wood like highlights that are fighting off a blackness that wants to cast it out. Once formed in the glass, the slick blackness wins the prominence and only shows a thin ring of wood highlights along the top when held to light. Almost two fingers worth of well packed, khaki colored bubbles of all sizes. Crown slowly recedes, leaving no lacing behind, and settles into a ring clinging to the glass while a misty fog covers the rest. 4.75. The nose carries a light, milky chocolate that seems silky in nature. I’m getting a somewhat piney, slightly resiny hop presence mixing with lighter roasty grains that show through as crusty edges of baked bread. The backend consists of cold brew coffee and just a kiss of cinnamon before finishing with a greatly balanced dry oak. 4.5. The taste brings in the spices with much more prominence; cinnamon with a tingle. It then turns its attention towards a creamy, cold brewed coffee along with silky, milk chocolate notes. Oak and a light molasses linger in the background. No bourbon to be detected and almost no barrel presence at all for me. 4.25.  1,883 characters	4.42
2412	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Wow, this is awesome!. Poured in a pint glass this was a very dark brown, nearly black brew that looked thick as motor oil. Tan head was about a finger tall and lasted for quite a while but with no lacing.. Aroma was cinnamon, chocolate, bourbon and malt with maybe a hint of coconut..  464 characters	4.59
2413	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Spotted this one at a local bottle shop and there were 7 left (2018 edition). Spice wars (DS) and Coconut (DS) were long gone, but this was still available months after it hit the shelves. Fremont Brewing has their BA program really dialed in, so I decided why not and picked up a couple. The store owner at the register told me this was a great beer and did not understand why it was taking a long time to sell.. Judging by the ratings here, I am in agreement.. All I can say is great job Fremont Brewing! An incredible blend of coffee and cinnamon. I am a sucker for coffee beers and the addition of cinnamon works in harmony with the coffee. The taste is incredible. Not one element (coffee or cinnamon) overpowers the other. Somehow someway, they blend together beautifully with barrel character amplifying that balance. The nose does not give it justice. When you taste it, you wonder how this could be nearly 14% ABV. There is also a subdued chocolate presence as well, but is detectable and adds to the depth of flavor..  1,433 characters	4.65
2414	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	"I may have alluded to this already, but the first time I tried this beer it was the last pour during a beer share that will most likely go down in the annals of history as being one of the most epic, because the pour order for that night if I remember correctly, was Elements of Composition, Side Project Jammy, Casey Family Preserves, Apparition, BA Damon, and then this weird bottle from a company I'd hardly ever heard of before.. My only reaction after trying CCB-Bomb for the first time was ""WHAT THE FUCK""; I was in such shock and awe that I couldn't believe what I was tasting was actually possible; a perfect blend of coffee, cinnamon, and leather filled the entirety of my mouth, and just kinda took over, as if it was planning on house-squatting for a very long time. I was therefore filled with... mixed emotions to say the least, when I tried this on draft, side by side with regular B-Bomb and Coconut B-Bomb at Imperial Taproom's B-Bomb event at their Alberta location:. the amazing balance between two hard-to-maintain flavors was nowhere to be found as the coffee just dominated everything in sight; the cinnamon was nary and afterthought, and none of the leathery, dark fruit-like flavors that were absolutely to die for present in the regular B-Bomb showed any intention of manifesting into reality. To provide some context to better explain my woe: I had already bought seven bottles of CCB-Bomb at this point, and had put aside two to send to Korea and to my #hopbae--the impending guilt from having to perhaps send two of my most cherished beer acquaintances a bad beer was to say the least, nerve-wracking..  3,068 characters"	4.64
2415	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Poured into a snifter. A nearly opaque dark brown color with a thin tan head. The foam settled quickly but left a decent ring in the glass. Aroma was equal amounts of freshly ground cinnamon, coffee, and milk chocolate. The barrel was hiding on the nose but very present on the palate. The cinnamon and coffee blended perfectly with the barrel, and the chocolate serves as a backdrop for the adjuncts. A pleasure to drink. Maybe my all-time favorite cinnamon beer.	4.47
2416	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	"The Bourbon Barrel Aged B-Bomb with coffee and Cinnamon (Abominable Snowman on label) is a truly outstanding beer. Full of flavor, complex, and very little taste of the alcohol despite the 2018 version having an ABV of 14.00%. Because of the nice and complex flavor it is easy to drink this ""heavy"" ale too quickly. It is delicious.. Look: It is black with a half inch frothy mocca colored head. Aroma: roasted malts, dark fruit, mild coffee, cinnamon, bourbon.  626 characters"	4.64
2417	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Bottled late 2016; drank 1/28/17 @ Yuss Haus Mach II.. Black/brown appearance; champagne bubbles throughout.. Nice khaki head; decent lace..  444 characters	4.43
2418	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Vintage 2018, reviewed 1/20/19. Poured from bottle into snifter after being out of fridge for about 30 minutes.. Look- pours mahogany brown with hints of ruby, and appears black in the glass. Light brown head and spotty lacing. Aroma- fudgy dark chocolate, espresso, cinnamon, vanilla, a mild oak note, and a little bourbon.  663 characters	4.31
2419	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	A winter warmer? The base beer, which is really pretty similar, is called an American Strong... I’d call them both really big, nicely crafted barleywines. But of course none of that really matters at all, the bottom line is that this is a very fine beer. It’s quite pretty, with a very coffee tone that includes a robust crema head. The aroma is subtle but rich, dominated by caramel malts and cinnamon. The taste certainly does offer a warming-in-winter feeling, with comfort food notes of biscuity malts, spice and boozy coffee. It does lack a bit in the necessary balance of all these enjoyable flavors, which is a task best left to a couple more years in the bottle.	4.22
2420	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	On tap at Imperial on Alberta for their Fremont event.. A very dark brown with a dark brown head with good retention and lacing, this looks solid. On the nose, this has coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, bourbon, mild oak char, and heavily toasted oak. Coffee character is similar to Dark Star w/Coffee with medium roast, chocolate, coffee, mild berry notes. Excellent creamy palate with alcohol well-integrated on the finish. Excellent.	4.28
2421	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	One of the most balanced coffee beers out there, as well as one of the most creative, balanced use of cinnamon. Fremont is the leader in how to best utilize barrels, and this beer epitomizes this. So lucky to live in the NW. It is worth the hype if you can get it.	5
2422	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	"L - Dark brown to black. Light brown head. Was darker than I expected.
S - Holy cinnamon batman. Coffee as well.
T - Wild flavors from this. Caramel cinnamon, coffee, toffee, and butterscotch. Some sweetness and bourbon as well.
F - Supppperrrr smooth. good thickness and covers the entire mouth
O - Really great beer. Flavors linger and change a bunch"	4.61
2423	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	08/2016 - This is drinking superbly; there's this delightful coconut that pops now, along with coffee, cinnamon, and brown sugar on the nose; the flavors are more of the same; pretty awesome mouthfeel, with a lightly sweet, bourbon finish.	4.46
2424	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	"2016 vintage
22oz bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep ruby brown color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has good retention that settles to a thin film and leaves a rung around the edge. S- initial aroma offers plenty of cinnamon complimented by a big bourbon barrel presence that adds notes of caramel, leather, chocolate and even a hint of coconut. Undertones of tobacco, dark fruits & earthy coffee.  1,044 characters"	4.68
2425	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	"Bottle Date: 2016
Palate Contaminants: none. Color is a completely opaque dark brown. Fine light brown head that goes away quickly, although there's a residual sheen of very fine carbonation on the surface.. Scent is cloves, molasses, and cinnamon. It's also notably sweet. Slight bourbon, and there's a little burnt sugar that stands apart from the molasses. Slightly mentholated..  1,136 characters"	4.51
2426	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Like a decadent breakfast in a bottle, the coffee and cinnamon in this bomb will start your day off with a bang. Dangerously smooth, the balance of this brew hides the heat behind sweet and velvety waves of flavor. These guys are professionals at the BA game, and this beer is another feather in their cap.	4.71
2427	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Appearance: poured a really dark murky brown with a pancake batter color head.. Smell: very malt forward aroma, with vanilla beans, honey biscuits, and sweet mocha. Trace of cinnamon comes through in a more subtle scent.. Taste: very sweet like an English barely wine. There is a huge essence of sweet vanilla beans with a biscuity maltiness. Then there are dark fruits - mainly plums. The coffee seems just a little muted but I think its partly due to the multitude of flavors I'm picking up. Cinnamon comes with a nice subtle spiciness, making this more like a baked dessert beer. Whiskey comes in at the finish, more noticeable at room temp. Tasted no alcohol presence..  912 characters	4.74
2428	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Can you say candy bar? When cared for correctly, this beer is an incredibly good BA sweet stout. The nuances of the cinnamon and coffee blend with the barrel and malt to form an almost caramel like note (milky way - ish). This beer is in my top 10 of all time BA stouts.	4.85
2429	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	201 vintage.. Look: Barely any head, very dark black body.. Smell : See below..  301 characters	4.97
2430	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Deep, almost black pour with a hint of rusty hues. Small head , even thin lace.. Coffee and cinnamon both come out right away, very roasty throughout. Semisweet chocolate balance out the nose.. More of the same in the flavors. Lots of cinnamon , roasty coffee, but stronger like espresso. Getting some oak, with a Bourbon tail comes next..  538 characters	4.23
2431	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	"Drank a 2016 bottle of this at the baseball tailgate versus UNLV a few weeks back. Pours black, probably around that 60/40 mix of black and dark brown in terms of where the SRM lies. Brown head, 1/3"". Aroma gave off a moderate amount of bourbon, not hot, a small amount of coffee and miniscule, albeit prolly the correct amount of cinnamon. The roasted malt was tucked away in the nose.. Taste was a well integrated easy drinking affair relatively speaking. The coffee melded well as it had been a few years since it was fresh. The bourbon really revealed a great job of blending the different ages of barrels. Mild chocolate, leather, tobacco and bark notes. This is similar to backwoods bastard with some adjuncts in it. Well done. The PacNW seemed like the last region to get bourbon barrel beers going into production in any serious amount of numbers, so its only natural on here that the scores for that stuff would be inflated (see east coast/middle of nowhere ipas). So while I can vouch this is a very good beer, its not quite elite world class tier, but it is damn good."	4.18
2432	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	2016 vintage - I lucked in to a few bottles of Fremont vintages while on a trip to Denver for Great American Beer Fest. I was just a bit ecstatic, as you might imagine. Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb was one of those beers - and while I had zero experience with Fremont at the time, I'd read reviews and was excited to try it.. But then it disappeared in to the cellar.. So, I had a bottle of Coconut B-Bomb recently and realized - hey, I have all of these bottles of Fremont to enjoy. I really should do that! So Coffee Cinnamon came out for a friend's going away party. My impressions: the beer is quite dark, but has a nice half a finger's head of light tan. It smells strongly of coffee and cinnamon. The taste is very cinnamon forward, but I suspect the coffee has faded a bit (no experience with fresher bottles to judge - just a suspicion). The coffee flavors have remained good though - no traces of vegetal flavors, no oxidation evident, all good here. The barrel is also quite nice and really complements the light spicy sweetness of the cinnamon..  1,211 characters	4.56
2433	Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb	Very nice cinnamon aroma, caramel, light coffee, bourbon, brown sugar, hint of licorice, earthy, tobacco, leather. Cinnamon is perfectly integrated in this beer!	4.52
2434	Beyond Good And Evil	I had been wanting to try this one for a long time and finally got to during FoFA weekend as on on-site offering at the brewery. Tremendous. Not too sweet - perfectly balanced.	4.6
2435	Beyond Good And Evil	"Wow just incredible.. Pitch black darkest of nights.
*disclaimer that I'm a cologne man and a touch may be creeping into the nose* But I pick up honeysuckle, maple, chocolate, toffee, almond, fig, black coffee.. Taste follows nose very well..  459 characters"	4.69
2436	Beyond Good And Evil	Look is classic stout - poured with an opaque head left minimal lacing. Nose is of chocolate, roasted malts/coffee, maple syrup. Taste follows the nose. Very, very well balanced between roasted malts, maple syrup. additionally, get notes of coffee and bakers chocolate. Feel has a good viscosity. Coats the tounge but leaves the pallet easily. Overall, excellent stout. This is what I wish stouts were moving towards - not something cloyingly sweet. Taste would be near perfect if I was able to get barrel.	4.46
2437	Beyond Good And Evil	Quite sweet - maple tastes just a bit granular and overly saccharine. But, it tastes natural all the same. An odd conflicting mouth-experience.. It's just a bit thinner than I'd like, but drinks very easy. Barrel isn't all that present, if at all - my palate had trouble discerning any wood, bourbon, or dryness. It's just sweet!. A good beer, but up against the likes of Canuckley or Mornin' Delight even, this beer doesn't really shine. Again - good, but showing some age.	4.08
2438	Beyond Good And Evil	2017 bottle, drank 2019. Pours dark. Aroma chocolate, bourbon & oak. Tastes amazing with the sweet chocolate, oak and bourbon. Barely taste the maple. Medium body. Incredible stout.	4.6
2439	Beyond Good And Evil	1/2 finger of head on a fairly aggressive pour. Pitch black, but effervescent bubbles give it a thin appearance. Aroma/Taste of rich roasted malt, bourbon and light maple syrup. Mouthfeel a bit thin but that is balanced by the good amount of carbonation.	3.77
2440	Beyond Good And Evil	"Beautiful dark and thick pour, thin tan colored head settles quickly into ring around glass.
Aroma and flavor consists of light bourbon, sweet and earthy maple, bittersweet baking chocolate and some deep, dark fruits.
Smooth, rich and creamy. Perfect mouthfeel for style.
Overall excellent and refined brew."	4.54
2441	Beyond Good And Evil	Nose is dark fruits and chocolate, rich oak. On palate is spice, plum, dark chocolate covered cherries, oak, sticky sweetness hinting at maple, dark roastyness, mellow vanilla and caramel, not a huge spirit quality but some mellow bourbon flavor in there to compliment the barrel notes, very rich and thick mouthfeel throughout.	4.63
2442	Beyond Good And Evil	375 bottle shared by Dan (@1up), thanks!. Not much head. Sweet flavor, but not a thick mouthfeel. Not a ton of barrel either. Good but not world class.	4.31
2443	Beyond Good And Evil	On draft at Hill Farmstead. Reminds me of a more refined Morning Delight. It doesn’t smack you in the face with maple like MD. I am a really big fan.	4.74
2444	Beyond Good And Evil	07/2015 - Bourbon, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, dark fruit, notably cherries; luscious, nice roastiness, super chocolaty, maple syrup for dayzzzz. Very tasty, very satisfied.	4.71
2445	Beyond Good And Evil	Very dark appearance with nice tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a nice bourbon maple. Taste is a slightly sweet bourbon and maple that is exceptionally smooth with a molasses touch	4.67
2446	Beyond Good And Evil	The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of maple syrup, baker’s chocolate, molasses, caramel, and bourbon. It tastes of baker’s chcolate, maple syrup, molasses, caramel, with some bourbon heat. The feel is thick, but smooth on the back end. A good barrel aged stout from Hill Farmstead, pretty light on the maple.	4.49
2447	Beyond Good And Evil	Fantastic beer. Dark brown to black appearance. Aromas are of sweet cocoa/bourbon/maple stout. Flavors are same. Very sweet, but not cloyingly so. Super pillowy soft mouthfeel. Perfect dessert beer. Would certainly revisit this!	5
2448	Beyond Good And Evil	375ml bottle, 2018 release, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 06.09.18, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a jet black color, thick and oily, very viscous with a thin tan head that has no retention nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of rich maple, sweet and sappy, tons of fudge brownie, light stone fruits, oak, bourbon, toffee, dark grains with a lingering marshmallow vanilla fragrance. The flavors are very good, intense fudge brownie, lots of rich dark chocolates with some underlying sweet maple, oaky bourbon with a nice vanilla sweetness, char and roast with brown sugar that plays well with the maple and finishes warmly with a light fruity acidity. The mouthfeel is great, coating medium/full body, not quite chewy but very smooth and gentle, velvety with an effortlessly easy finish that has nice legs and a warming sensation.. Verdict: A very good barrel aged imperial stout from Hill Farmstead. Rich flavors, balanced well that is very easy going. The maple adds a nice amount of sweetness to the beer but it brings with it some nice depth and complexity.	4.22
2449	Beyond Good And Evil	Shared with a friend while in Europe, bottle dated 2017, which I purchased in January 2018.. Pours an inky, thick opaque back, with coffee-and-cream head that dissipates relatively quickly. Some faint, light lacing on glass.. Aroma is earthy malt and dark bread, hint of molasses. Something very vaguely like tequila, which is probably woody character from the barrel aging, but a little spicier than most bourbon barrel stouts I've sampled..  1,270 characters	4.14
2450	Beyond Good And Evil	500mL June 2017 bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead balloon glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this with me.. Pours a deep brown body, once it’s in the glass it’s opaque and black, thick. Small brown head reduces fairly quickly.. Aromas are sweet and fudgy, cocoa and dark fruit, biscotti, vanilla, and subtle maple. On the tongue it’s quite sweet but not cloying or “pastry”-like, more malty that sugary with rich chocolate fudge, vanilla-maple liquor, bourbon, dark fruits, molasses and roasty coffee on the follow through. Maple shows up as it warms up. The finish is roasty as well, bittersweet chocolate / charred malt sticks on the tongue for a bit. Mouthfeel is rich and thick with low carbonation. Definitely a sipper..  832 characters	4.6
2451	Beyond Good And Evil	Poured into a HF bulb. Brownish/Black in color with a small mocha head. Smells of dark fruit, some maple, oak and bourbon. Taste is exactly as the nose but more prominent. Not as much maple as one might think but it’s there. Just a treat to sip on. Feel is slick and mouth coating, almost chewy. Overall, this is really great. HF just makes everything well and this is no exception.	4.6
2452	Beyond Good And Evil	Fresh batch drank at dark lord day 2018. Really a special beer. The barreling is perfectly done here. The maple was strong but balanced at the same time. The base stout is simply fantastic and the sum of all parts was exquisite. Heck of a beer here.	4.66
2453	Beyond Good And Evil	HOw is this not higher on the list? THis is literally one of the best stouts I have ever had. Very smooth with a slight maple flavor and bourbon. Amazing beer	4.8
2454	Beyond Good And Evil	2018 release (bottled June 2017).. A: Pours black, viscous, with a thin ring of tan colored head. Some dots of lacing. Decent retention for what’s there.. S: Big, rich dark cacao chocolate, vanilla bean, light roast, and a bit of coconut and bourbon. Wisp of blackcurrant as it warms..  786 characters	4.64
2455	Beyond Good And Evil	2014 batch enjoyed in 2017 and it was still amazing. Huge oaky bourbon aroma, maple still strong, fairly nice mouthfeel and plenty of sweetness. Absolutely delicious sweet stout.	4.91
2456	Beyond Good And Evil	The pour is stark black and fills identically, building only a thin but surprisingly persistent dark tan bubbly fizz that finally settles to a thin ring after five minutes.. Smell is delectably toasty and bruleed maple-covered oatmeal and syrupy bourbon all the way. There is a hint of dark chocolate and waxy nougat in the oakiness.. On the palate a thickly velvety slick moderate to full body glides across the tongue with a deep dark maple sweetness that is just present enough to say hi without being too sweet. This is paired with a nutty wet oak and a bourbon tingle. These components combine to bring a raisin, prune and sassafras accent to a vanilla, amaretto-khalua richness. A slight astringent hop presence sneaks in here or there..  986 characters	4.1
2457	Beyond Good And Evil	This one pours a very dark black, with a small foamy head, and not much lacing.. This smells like earthy, bittersweet and authentic maple syrup, oak, chocolate fudge, smoke, and espresso.. This has such a wonderful silky feel to it- the maple is very present, even after two years in the barrel, and lends a flavor akin to sweet woodsy velvet. There's not a ton of bourbon, but there's a nice oak spiciness, and a hint of espresso on the back end. There's a bit of molasses and caramel as well, as well a creamy chocolate..  744 characters	4.77
2458	Beyond Good And Evil	Vintage 2014. Properly cellared since the release.. A: Dark pour with medium head and heavy lacing. Filtrates remain in the beer, which takes away from its overall appearance.. S: Chocolate, barrel, and sweet maple sugar. The nose on the bottled version was slightly muted..  715 characters	4.62
2459	It Was All A Dream	A smooth soft maple backbone with a splash of coconut, with coffee and vanilla to follow. Very drinkable, my only complaint is the maple over powers the bourbon barrel.	4.66
2460	It Was All A Dream	Poured into a snifter. A motor oil viscous opaque dark brown color with a small tan head that stuck around for a while. The taste and aroma were as billed with a big coffee presence, maple, chocolate, and faint bourbon. I didn't get much coconut as it seemed to blend with the maple. Thick but not cloying and not boozy. A real treat.	4.49
2461	It Was All A Dream	"Oily black with a surprisingly persistent creamy but thin mocha blanket.. Maple brulee and mocha roast are accented by sweet dark fruit and a little waxy oak via a crackly medium-light body that finishes semi-sticky with a mild heat.. I wasn't floored by this one, especially considering the hype behind it, but I had a few other beers this night that kind of trounced IWAAD. The complexity was lacking, and so too was the pastry decadence--I figured there'd at least be an explosion of one or the other. I guess on one hand you can say, then, ""it's balanced,"" but it wasn't quite there either. Pretty sweet with some heat, and a mostly mild maple character, I was surprised there was so little coconut--I got a couple of pours to be sure."	4.23
2462	It Was All A Dream	Almost to good, the flavors were all there and none of those were really overpowering the other. But the presence of all those wonderful flavors pushed the stout into the back just a little to much. I am just nagging though, I felt really privileged for being able to enjoy this beer.	4.74
2463	It Was All A Dream	Incredibly sweet, a straight up dessert beer for sure. It had delicious, intense coconut dominating the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel was excellent, no complains at all. Only good in small quantities though, due to the cloying sweetness.	4.45
2464	It Was All A Dream	07/2017 - This is bananas - I love all the elements of this ale, such as the nose and palate being chock full of maple, coconut, and coffee without being overwhelming. Supremely excellent mouthfeel that goes on and on. But my favorite part is you can't detect the 17%. Superb!	4.84
2465	It Was All A Dream	Have had b1 and b2 and consensus for both: absolutely amazing aroma and adjunct presence ...but extremely sweet, a bit insubstantial both in mouthfeel and barrel presence. A whale worth tasting but with room for improvement.	4.57
2466	It Was All A Dream	"Batch 2
Pours pitch black, glugs out of the bottle. Thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Coconut fat floaters. The nose is just insane, coffee roast, sweet marshmallow, coconut, smoky oak, bourbon, sweet maple. Taste is a layered dessert. Chocolate cake, smoke, roasted coffee beans, vanilla icing, sweet toasted coconut, spicy bourbon, maple comes across subtlety in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, sticky, coats your mouth. Overall, what more can be said, the adjuncts just play so well off of each other here, and some how come together perfectly. This beer is well worth the cost of admission. Phenomenal!"	4.74
2467	It Was All A Dream	"L: Rich and thick mahogany mocha hues with a khaki head and nice lacing
S: Dark roast coffee, fudge, and loads of maple and some barrel on the nose
T: Decadent and thick Grade B maple syrup, fudge, candied brown sugar/panela, slight trace of coconut, and subtle vanilla bean
F: Thick and syrupy motor oil - sticks to your mouth
O: World class stout from one of the best in the game. J. Wakefield really orchestrates a boatload of flavors into a harmonious cohesion nearly better than anyone else. Awesome stout - glad I was finally able to try it."	4.99
2468	It Was All A Dream	"Pours pitch black, almost no head. 
Aroma has roasted coconut, maple syrup, nuts, bitter chocolate, fudge, caramel. 
Taste is the same, thick mouthfeel, liquid bounty bar."	5
2469	It Was All A Dream	"Look: oil black, thick khaki head with gorgeous lacing
Smell: chocolate, bourbon, with hints of maple, coconut and coffee
Taste: huge chocolate and vanilla flavors with late hints of coffee, coconut and maple.... finishes maple soaked bourbon.
Feel: full, lingering mouth feel"	4.88
2470	It Was All A Dream	"Look: oil black, thick khaki head with gorgeous lacing
Smell: chocolate, bourbon, with hints of maple, coconut and coffee
Taste: huge chocolate and vanilla flavors with late hints of coffee, coconut and maple.... finishes maple soaked bourbon.
Feel: full, lingering mouth feel"	4.94
2471	It Was All A Dream	"Batch one in a tulip at 55 degrees. Look: oil black, thick khaki head with gorgeous lacing
Smell: chocolate, bourbon, with hints of maple, coconut and coffee
Taste: huge chocolate and vanilla flavors with late hints of coffee, coconut and maple.... finishes maple soaked bourbon.
Feel: full, lingering mouth feel, honestly perfect.. Best beer ever"	4.88
2472	It Was All A Dream	batch 2 drank in a snifter on 3/15/2018...bottle split two ways, so a massive pour and wow what a way to drink this beer. look - pitch black, surprising 1/2 finger light tan head, tons of lacing, absolutely coating the sides of the glass and just stopping on the sides of the glass barely sliding down. smell - tons of coconut and maple in the nose, barrel and chocolate and vanilla and way behind in the race, bold and lovely.  900 characters	4.94
2473	It Was All A Dream	Super amazing barrel-aged stout with a number of great adjuncts all in one. Each of the adjunct flavors shine through in the low carb semi-thick beer. Definitely try to get your hands on one!	5
2474	It Was All A Dream	"Pours pitch black, almost no head.
Aroma has roasted coconut, maple syrup, nuts, bitter chocolate, fudge, caramel.
Taste is the same, thick mouthfeel, liquid bounty bar."	4.74
2475	It Was All A Dream	another one thank's to jwb and maddogg...love ya mike.. we just had bake and this one is way better in my opinion. everything is just a bit lighter and more in the right place. a bit less overwhelming in the feel/flavor. all the flavors are there.	4.75
2476	It Was All A Dream	Very rarely do I give a 5 for every category, but there just really isn't any other choice here.. The first thing you notice is the coconut floaties. Now I'm not talking about the occasional sprinkle you get with Cycle or other decent BA coconut Stouts. The chunks of coconut just come flowing out. Unreal. This beer is so thick, too. Coats the glass. Smell is amazing. No one adjunct stands out above the rest. Same with the taste. Absolutely incredible..  879 characters	5
2477	It Was All A Dream	"I was drinking a crooked stave sour out of a JWB glass at a new bottleshop in St. Pete with a couple friends who knew the owners. they sat down with us and started to chat and have some drinks. We began talking about the glass and they mentioned that they recently had a very succesful J. Wakefield event. I mentioned how I would have loved to have tried ""It was all a dream"". One of the owners said ""I have a bottle in the fridge if you'd like to try it"". i was blown away by the hospitality. The beer poured with creamy specs of coconut. The scent was off the hook with loads of maple and coconut shining through. It tasted like heaven in a bottle with even more coconut in the back end. Light mouthfeel for how heavy the beer was with a very light carbonation and very little head. Overall one of the best beers I've ever had."	4.86
2478	It Was All A Dream	"Holy Mother of God!!! 2017 bomber poured into my treehouse tulip glass.... this is the bomb! I love coconut stouts, and literally bought every prop '13 i could find for a year---must've drank 15-20 of them, and until now, was my gold standard (although Snowed In was damned good). But this beer leaves all other coconut stouts in the dust--not only because it has incredible coconut flavors--it has floaties!--but also because of the intense berry flavor (raspberry mostly) that compliments the coconut so well, and then some coffee and a hint of chili peppers kicks in on the finish...WOW.
Incredible silky smooth thick body, sweet enough to be considered a dessert beer, but not cloying or overly sweet (though I couldn't kill a whole bottle in one sitting)---which I'm not a fan of, and certainly a different beer than Assassin, KBBS, Summation, etc. as its a flavored variant.
I'm already a huge fan of their sours, and If this is an indication of J Wakefield stouts, I cant wait to try my Notorius and BK... Impressive!"	5
2479	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	2016 version poured into a snifter. There is a nice booziness in the aroma however it is more subdued in taste. I enjoy the mouthfeel a great deal. I was anticipating this being a little sweeter with less char and bitterness in the finish.	4.1
2480	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Dark-stained chestnut with a finger of mocha head. Spotty, short-lived lacing.. Big brownie chocolate and bourbon in the aroma. Hints of vanilla, cherry, wood and root beer.. Nice depth of flavor: chocolate, roasted malts, gentian, root beer, vanilla, nuts, earthy hops and alcohol burn..  469 characters	4.13
2481	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Jet black beer in a glass. Small tan head.. Sweet vanilla booze, chocolate, lots of dark fruit, coffee on the nose and taste.. Only complaint which is a minor one is the mouthfeel. An absolute stunner of a stout although..  239 characters	4.58
2482	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	L - 1-finger dense mocha head atop a pitch black body.. S - oak, raisins, chocolate, vanilla. Not even a hint of booze.. T - tons of dark fruit, smoke, chocolate, roast, vanilla, then some bourbon on the finish. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness..  388 characters	4.48
2483	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	I've kept this aging in the bottle about a year I think. It needed aging because it first tasted somewhat raw, not as good as the regular Plead the Fifth.. Appearance: brownish black with a very short head, hints of copper and dark red when strong light is shined through the head.. Aroma: sweet light molasses and sugar.  713 characters	4.44
2484	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Sweet hell. Like Karl Malone in the 4th quarter, this one delivers. Think of your darkest moment, think of your darkest fantasy, think of your darkest memory... and then bottle that in a 12 ouncer and Plead the 5th Barrel Aged is what you have. The most beautiful, the most visceral, the most wild moment of your life... Think and dream. And in this beverage, I do.	4.49
2485	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	"2012 Batch. A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a finger of dense tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of intense chocolate and roasted malts with some hint of vanilla and a touch of coffee. Slight malted milk ball aroma
T: Taste is chocolate and roasted malts with some coffee. Charred wood and burnt sugars with some slight caramel, oak and vanilla. Nice roasted undertones throughout with that slight malted milk ball flavor going on. On the swallow this beer is malted milk balls, chocolate, espresso beans, and roasted malts with some lingering vanilla.
M: This beer is on the heavier side of medium in body with carbonation that is on the low end but adequate for the style. The style and ABV ensure that this beer has a drying finish.
O: Overall this is a really well crafted beer. The flavors are impeccable and it has held up surprisingly well to the time. Definitely worth trying if you like the style and can find it."	4.5
2486	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	02/2016 - vintage 2015 - a lot of brownie, fudge, nice tobacco notes, smooth bourbon on the nose; slightly sweet, a bit creamy too, rich chocolate, bourbon on the palate; the body is to be desired, but overall it's tasty.	4.46
2487	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Pours a pitch black coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla, with a lightly boozy bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, with strong notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla and ligher notes of toffee, dark fruits, tobacco, charred oak, bourbon and a hint of a certain musty earthiness. Finishes with a light bitterness and booziness. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.. This is reasonably complex and quite well-balanced, although the barrel-character is not that much at the forefront. Still, all the different notes intermingle harmoniously without anything standing out too much. Remionds me a little of KBS, actually.	4.25
2488	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	12oz bottle with no date on it. Pours a viscous black with no head. Zero lacing. Boozey aroma with vanilla, molasses, caramel and chocolate syrup. The taste is the Bourbon up front followed by dark chocolate, roasted malts, earth, tobacco and espresso. Woody, Bourbon finish with some cocoa. About as much alcohol heat as expected. Very low carbonation with a mouthfeel that is slightly lighter than expected. Overall, a great variant of an already great RIS.	4.29
2489	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Pours midnight black and thick as motor oil, with a plump head of off-white foam.. Deep roasted malt lends coffee like aroma, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak barrel notes.. The base beer actually stands out in flavor tremendously, while the barrel character adds vanilla, oak, bourbon, and toffee notes..  438 characters	4.4
2490	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	"12 FL. OZ. bottle
Served in a snifter
2015. This beer pours black in color with just a light film of head that leaves some nice lacing for as little head as it has.. I smell chocolate, vanilla, and caramel..  608 characters"	4.28
2491	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Finally got a four pack for $22 from Liquor Cabinet on Hilltop Road in St. Joseph, Michigan on February 18th, 2018. Was worth the wait! Outstanding beer very near as good as the great ones like KBS, Goose Island BCBS, and Bells Black Note.	4.5
2492	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Recent vintage although I forgot to tlook for a date. Poured into tulip glass.. Pour: deep black with some brown hints. Well used motor oil. Surprisingly, absolutely no head no matter how I tried. Really thin collar but no lacing at all. Maybe a bad bottle?. Aroma: dark dried fruits, some mellow bourbon, Oak, chocolate. Really nice. Balanced with nothing dominating but all working well together..  1,102 characters	4.03
2493	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Appearance - Pours black with nice mocha colored head that lasts longer than expected settling to a rocky mountain with decent lacing.. Aroma - Huge amount of oak and vanilla this is a 2015 so the bourbon has settled a bit ad is working well with the chocolate, leather and roasted malts. Very complex aroma.. Taste - Wow excellent balance of chocolate, vanilla a little cinnamon, oak and leather. This thing is money with almost 3 years on it..  643 characters	4.61
2494	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	The hype out does the beer. I aged my bottle 3 years and love bb aged stouts but this was just... meh. Darkhorse Plead the Fifth is average and only becomes enjoyable after a year so I hoped this would do well with time. Got the flavors of dried fruits, raison, fig still had chocolate notes but the alcohol burn was still too present and not smooth. This one can't compete with Founder's Imperial stout or KBS or with Goose Island	4.13
2495	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	"Pours pitch black with quickly fading tan head.
The aroma is bourbon forward with some roast, molasses and chocolate. There is also a mild black licorice note that is weaker than the base beer, but still present.
The bourbon is stronger on the flavor than the aroma, but is still very well balanced. The oakiness vanilla and booziness plays really well with the light roast chocolate dark fruit and licorice.
The mouthfeel is somewhat thick with more carbonation than normal in this style.
Overall, it's a very good beer, but not quite on the level I was expecting for a beer this highly rated. It's still definitely worth checking out, but for being one of my main wants it was a little disappointing."	4.25
2496	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Opaque brown color with a soft tan head. Nice retention for the ABV. Aromas of whiskey, oak, vanilla, chocolate. The taste followed with a nice mix of the above flavors. Heavy on the bourbon but reasonably balanced. all in all, a great BA RIS.	4.24
2497	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	This was pretty good. Again, non-adjunct stout which is uncommon in today's market. The barrel aging brings out all of the notes in it. I wouldn't put it among the best stouts I've had but it's pretty solid.	4.46
2498	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Pour is viscous shiny black with a minimal but vibrant mocha froth receding to a thin ring.. Nose is unabashedly barrel-forward, drastically hotter and oakier compared to the base, with a dominant maple bourbon glazed pecan note that's almost bacony.. Taste is warming, spicy bourbon with dark chocolate and nutty molasses featuring some raisin and black licorice. Roastiness from the base is still present, but the booze does take over with reckless abandon..  767 characters	3.62
2499	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	2017 vintage, an LIF bottle from outstanding BA FlintB - thanks again, sir!. Beer pours a very deep brown-black with a pleasant beige head. The beer has a curious almost fruity, floral aroma to it. Odd. Maybe my nose isn't great - entirely possible.. BA Plead the 5th has a significant dry, woody barrel character to it while it warms - it fades slightly when it reaches room temperature-ish. There is a slight taste of vanilla, with plenty of cocoa/chocolate - and while the mouth feel is slightly thin, the chocolate feels like it adds some richness and complexity to the taste..  871 characters	4.25
2500	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Tasted from draft. Pours black with white head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, bourbon. Mouthfeel is super thick, sticky, oily. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild to moderate bitterness. Flavors of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, vanilla. Huge very well done BA stout.	4.79
2501	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Pours black. Thin, short, brown head fades fast.. Smells light bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and dark fruit.. Tastes heavy dark fruit and light roast malt at first. Followed by chocolate, roasty malt, bourbon, light oak and vanilla hints. Finish is semi sweet with a roasty and dark fruit linger. Lighter medium body and creamy medium carbonation.	4.37
2502	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Why this beer is on the 250 top list? Like all Dark Horse beers this is brewed horribly. No balance, hardly any bourbon, and no barrel flavor. Dark as night, dark fruity boozy smell but really no enjoyable flavor. Dark Horse is a disappointment every time. Licorice, tobacco, dark fruit flavors with harsh booziness. Slightly smoother than regular Plead the 5th but not smooth or tasty enough to belong in top 250. Witch's Hat Night Furies need to take its place.	2.55
2503	Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th	Very dark appearance with a small tan head. Aroma is a molasses and bourbon that is a little sweet. The taste is a very nice molasses and bourbon without any alcohol taste. Very nice	4.54
2504	Notorious Triple IPA	Copper filtered with moderate carbonation and 4 fingers of off white head.. Smells amazing of dank onion and garlic with a balance of fruity guava, mangos and pineapple.. Tastes of fried garlic and durian, jackfruit, soursop, and mango..  447 characters	4.62
2505	Notorious Triple IPA	Appearance: Arrives clear and golden colored with a one finger cap; dots of lacing. Smell: Big malt and hip aromatics with overripe pineapple and caramel driving the malt and and dank pithy pomelo on the hops. Taste: As with the aroma the malt and hops battle it out with the tropical fruit merging into dank tones; old school bitterness, through the middle with a boozy but dry finish.  562 characters	4.03
2506	Notorious Triple IPA	10oz draft pour at the Three Floyds Taproom, poured into a snifter glass, enjoyed on 6.6.19, reviewed from tasting notes.. The beer pours a orange and amber color, golden hues when hit by the light and a firm finger of white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a few spots of soapy lacing. The aroma is very good, super resinous, lots of citrus peel, lightly floral, more on the dank side of things with a strong sticky sweet malt backbone, assertive and boozy. The flavors are great, bitter and resinous pine, dank floral and grassy qualities, lots of citrus peel that offers some tropical fruits but ultimately more bitterness and a heart malt backbone, strong caramel and amber malts with some softer cereal grains and a warm booze character. The mouthfeel is good, sticky, coating, medium bodied with a good liveliness to it and finishes with a big dry kick and a warm boozy bite.. Verdict: A very good west coast IPA from Boneyard. Classic in style, bold, brash, just a massive IPA, certainly boozy but with an oddly nice balance. West Coast through and through, just a massive IPA.	4.24
2507	Notorious Triple IPA	Unknown vintage; drank 8/13/15 @ Tap House Grill (Seattle).. Semi-opaque orange appearance.. White head; a curtain of lace..  315 characters	4.59
2508	Notorious Triple IPA	10/2015 - huge hoppiness, tangerine, big malts, ethanol on the nose; dank, pine flavors pair nicely with more tangerine, orange zest; surprisingly dry, lightly bitter finish, with a touch of heat in the back. I like this more than Pliny the Younger for sure.	4.6
2509	Notorious Triple IPA	Taster and shot-ski at brewery. For a big triple IPA, it’s pretty smooth, almost seems harmless. Goes down very easy, hoppy, but not much evidence of the high ABV. Light golden, mild haze, small fluffy head. Here’s a beer you could drink until...you realized what you were drinking. Tasty.	4.19
2510	Notorious Triple IPA	Had on tap. Just a luscious and delicious dipa. And extremely drinkable too! That 12 percent is dangerously unnoticeable amongst floral and citrus hops and the hazy and bready backbone of the beer. Just bursts off the palate	4.49
2511	Notorious Triple IPA	"Growler fill poured into a snifter.
Look- very light amber, hazy, average lacing, below average head retention.
Smell- citrus, orange peel, floral notes, slightly dank.
Taste- citrus blast, floral notes.
Feel- slightly below average carbonation (which I like), medium body.
Overall- Great balance, I would never have guessed this beer has an ABV north of 11%. This beer is nearly perfect and one of the best I have ever tasted."	4.97
2512	Notorious Triple IPA	Sweet Jeebus, this is one intense, delicious beer. It should come with a disclaimer as it's a barely wine disguised by a clean and beautiful golden body with a shit ton of hop aroma. Beer sugar like with a citrus hop bombardment, with a sweet then bitter feel. Rich with alcohol presence well established, but not overly fusel.. This is a dangerous beer. Wonderfully executed and over the top without being pretentious. Cheers	4.68
2513	Notorious Triple IPA	This pours a darker tan caramel color. I get a sweetish citrus aroma that's matched by the taste from each sip. Sweet sticky citrusy and smooth. Hides its abv well.	4.1
2514	Notorious Triple IPA	Sampled at cophenhagen beer festival in Boston, MA.. Pours a clear yellow-orange body with little head or retention. Aromas of pine, citrus and dank herbal hops. On the tongue is resinous, piney hops and an easy finish. Medium carbonation and body.. Good west coast style	4.31
2515	Notorious Triple IPA	"Tasted at Copenhagen Festival. A: Pours a deep burnt golden color, almost amber. Had a finger of sticky, greasy, off-white head that held great retention. The head eventually faded into a thick collar leaving sheets of sticky lace down the glass.
S: Resinous, dank, and herbal notes overshadowed by a dominantly sweet and fruity hop nose.
T: Sweet and jammy fruity hop flavor with hints of candied fruit and berry preserves up front, followed by a bitter, herbal, and dank finish. Vegetal aftertaste with notes of onion/chive and herbs. Lightly bitter lingering aftertaste.
M: Surprisingly light mouthfeel for the amount of alcohol, with a full yet crisp and drying mouthfeel that isn't overly greasy or heavy. Not overly bitter, no trace of alcohol warmth. Tingly fresh hop oil mouthfeel.
O: Herbal earthy bitterness with fruity and sweet notes balancing. Potent but very smooth and highly drinkable."	4.39
2516	Notorious Triple IPA	"10oz tulip on tap at THG.. A: Pours a deep burnt golden with a finger of sticky, greasy, off-white head that held great retention. The head eventually faded into a thick collar leaving sheets of sticky lace down the glass.
S: Resinous, dank, and herbal notes overshadowed by a dominantly sweet and fruity hop nose.
T: Sweet and jammy fruity hop flavor with hints of candied fruit and berry preserves up front, followed by a bitter, herbal, and dank finish. Vegetal aftertaste with notes of onion/chive/cat-pee herb garden. Lightly bitter lingering aftertaste.
M: Surprisingly light mouthfeel for the amount of alcohol, with a full yet crisp and drying mouthfeel that isn't overly greasy or heavy. Not overly bitter, no trace of alcohol warmth. Tingly fresh hop oil mouthfeel.
O: Herbal earthy bitterness with fruity and sweet notes balancing. Potent but very smooth and highly drinkable."	4.17
2517	Notorious Triple IPA	On draft at Boneyard tasting room. Light golden in appearance. Taste was malty with a citrusy component. It was very good for as high ABV as it was, but honestly I don't get the hype.	4.4
2518	Notorious Triple IPA	Had a fresh crowler of this on 4/8/2017. Overall this was a very enjoyable beer. It truly went down like a 7% beer, which was awesome for drinking it, however, it makes it dangerously easy to drink fast too. There is a really exceptional combo of sweet, caramelly malts and fruity, citrusy, floral hops. The flavors were fairly complex because of this and overall this was a really enjoyable beer to finally get to try. May be tough to chase, but very well done.	4.44
2519	Notorious Triple IPA	"Crowler Date: 3/8/17
Palate Contaminants: seafood udon. Appearance is a very pleasant medium-dark amber, and it's fairly clear. Fair amount of fine head that leaves some nice lacing.. Smell is peach, red grapefruit, honeydew melon, and marshmallows. (I keep smelling those damn things.) It has a little bit of freshly cut white wood, just not quite pine. Sweetness is moderate, and any bitterness is hardly detectable..  1,253 characters"	4.54
2520	Notorious Triple IPA	had this on tap at the mule bar in Winooski VT.. pours an almost clear golden color, thin band of white head leaves some nice lacing.. somewhat mild aromas - pine, dankness, sweet malts, citrus peel, grapefruit, hint of ripe fruits. palate follows nicely, but is somewhat dominated by sweet and syrupy malts and booze. the booze is not astringent or bothersome, but definitely comes through as expected at this abv. caramel and honey malts play nicely with grapefruit, pine, floral qualities, orange, hint of ripe tropical fruits including mango and maybe a touch of pineapple. piney bitterness on the finish is well balanced by the malt sweetness. mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy... not on par with the pillowy NE ipas that I adore. overall its remarkably drinkable for the abv, and is not excessively boozy in any way. however the balance tips towards malty sweetness and alcohol over the fruity hops, and having enjoyed more fruit forward triple IPAs such as Sunshine & Peril, this isnt one I would necessarily seek out. still enjoyable and interesting to try!	4.34
2521	Notorious Triple IPA	Had this on tap on 12/3 at Growler Guys in Portland.. A: Pours a golden orange color with minimal white head. Very small amounts of thin white lacing throughout.. S: Big fruity/citrusy aromas of pineapple, orange, and guava. Milder notes of dank, piney, and earthy hops..  776 characters	4.87
2522	Notorious Triple IPA	"This beer is pretty damn difficult to distinguish between it and PTY. Seriously. For years now I've been just skipping the big line at the DIPA fest for PTY and just getting Notorious with no line, the beers are almost indistinguishable.. Has a pretty color that is a mixture of both orange and gold, comes with a 1/3"" head.. Aroma is delightful. All that hop noise under the nose, usual descriptors of awesomeness, pick whatever tropical, stone and citrus fruits you want, mix in those pine/green/dank descriptors on top of it..  982 characters"	4.74
2523	Notorious Triple IPA	A great looking IPA, nice clear orange with decent head. Smells of tropical fruit, grapefruit dank but a bit muted. Taste follows. Not sure if they sent a fresh keg to Shelton Festival, will have to revisit out west. But this fell short of they hype for me.	4.16
2524	Notorious Triple IPA	L- pours a hazy orange color with a half inch head that dissipates fairly quickly.. S- smell o f tropical notes, very fruity. Apricots come to mind.. wife says fruit roll up lol... T- very smooth.. not much boozyness to it but you can tell it is a strong beer..  387 characters	4.86
2525	Notorious Triple IPA	Coppenhagen Beer Fest Boston sample pour. This has been a want of mine for a while. It was really good. Huge and citrusy. Pithy and resiny but also had some pretty intense fruity hop notes. I often find Triple IPAs are too sweet and boozy; the structure of the beer is all off. This one bucks that trend.	4.43
2526	Notorious Triple IPA	"Beer comes in a deep gold to Amber.
Aroma offers intense juiciness, grapefruit, pine, peach, mango.
Flavor explodes with intense mango, peach, pineapple. Onto medium plus biscuity sweetness, pine, dry on the finish. Syrupy at points, but also on the palate. A bit of stingy alcohol on the back."	4.56
2527	Notorious Triple IPA	thanks mark. this is so good. dangerously smooth and drinkable. the heat is invisible and not syrupy. easy drinking. I am super impressed with this brew...esp since this is a tripleading ipa.	4.5
2528	Notorious Triple IPA	I received a crowler sent from my cousin. I was worried that because I was out of town and it has been quite warm by the time I got home the hops may have fallen off. My worries were eased as soon as I cracked the beer open . The smell instantly filled my nostrils. Lemon, citrus, floral, pure deliciousness. The crowler retained the carbonation well and I got a good amount of head. The taste ... amazing. Similar to the smell citrus and floral and not to bitter with just the right amount of sweetness. Overall and awesome beer. Hopefully I'll get to try it again one day.	4.7
2529	Last Buffalo In The Park	I have had a few of these through the years, always excellent but for whatever reason 2019 feels a bit boozy at the end, prior years loved the roasty grainy after taste. Still better than 90-95% of what is out there.	4.48
2530	Last Buffalo In The Park	"The look and mouthfeel of this beer are world class.
Where things falls apart is the same old story with every Funky Buddha beer I’ve tried, that cheap, chemical flavor from the adjuncts. It tastes like the beer equivalent of fast food."	3.63
2531	Last Buffalo In The Park	I love Last Snow. Unfortunately while in the Tampa area this past March there was none that I could find. This beeer is courtesy of my friend and BA icon @DoctorZombies. Thank you my friend. There is only one rason this beer does not get a 5 and that is because no beer is perfect. This is damn close.It may be a touch on the sweet side but it just works. Oh, if only I had a cellar full I would be giddy !	4.75
2532	Last Buffalo In The Park	Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, bold coconut right at the forefront. Vanilla bean quickly follows coconut. What happens next is a mixture of gift shop fudge, toffee and coffee and hearty stout malts, with notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, coffee and roasty, toasty, caramely malts charging through. There is a very light whiskey heat on the edge, but it melds into the background well. Flavor profile continues to push the coconut heavy narrative, with vanilla bean coming on second. Between the two, the onset is very sugary. The remainder of the flavor profile works its way back towards balanced by order of notes of toffee, caramel, molasses, coffee, and roasty, toasty malts. Whiskey starts to come on at the end to boil away some of the sugar. Whiskey melds in well, never coming off as hot or out of place. Mouth feel is thick with a grainy velvety texture that feels decadent each and every sip. Overall, boisterous with a lot going on, with coconut and vanilla bean at the helm.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle.	4.47
2533	Last Buffalo In The Park	Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of beige around the rim and just a trace of it showing elsewhere. The aroma is of coconut and bourbon. I’m tasting an amazing melange of coconut, coffe, and bourbon. The mouth is oily, dry, and viscous.	4.29
2534	Last Buffalo In The Park	Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a dark brewed coffee, with little wood like highlights running throughout. It forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly. 3.75. The nose carries a stinging bourbon before even putting my nose to it. Putting my nose into it brings it with a more toned definition. There is freshly cut coconut mixing with brown sugar and that warming bourbon with a kiss of dark fruit. They achieved a very natural coconut; no suntan lotion smell. 4.75. The taste brings in the brown sugar just tangling with freshly toasted coconut all the way through. Slight milk chocolate, but just as an accent. It’s almost like a coconut pie drizzled with some chocolate. The bourbon is there with some dark fruit accents, but they didn’t let this stray too far away from what the base is. 4.5.  1,519 characters	4.52
2535	Last Buffalo In The Park	A slick black color with a frothy brown head. These guys seem to make some of the most strongly smelling dark beers that I have ever had. Big notes of coffee, chocolate, and spices. The drinking starts smooth and silky upfront with tons of lush chocolate malts. A smooth flow that finishes ever so slightly bitter. The coffee falls on the subtle side but the highlight flavor is clearly the coconut. I love coconut and the flavor comes off spot on genuine. Additional notes of tannin, smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa powder, and smoke. The mouth feel is superb- full bodied with such a lush and silky feel. Not overly sweet and not terribly sticky but enough to still allow the flavors to linger nicely after each sip. A slight alcohol burn on the finish but otherwise the abv hides very well and it's really warming me up.. Overall, just crazy good stuff.	4.57
2536	Last Buffalo In The Park	L - 2-finger hazelnut head atop a pitch black body.. S - coconut from across the room. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate.. T - follows the nose. Coconut-forward, with bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate, just a little coffee. Somewhat abrasive finish. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate-low booziness..  380 characters	4.44
2537	Last Buffalo In The Park	Bomber poured into snifter. Jet black liquid , one finger brown foam cap quickly recedes. Aroma of a mounds bar , chocolate , coconut , bourbon.  257 characters	4.49
2538	Last Buffalo In The Park	Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of chocolate notes with some residual sugar notes and some bourbon notes are also perceptible. Taste is a mix of chocolate notes with some bourbon notes, light vanilla with some residual sugar notes. Body is full with nice oily texture with some creamy notes, good carbonation and no real alcohol is perceptible. Greta porter with nice depth and complexity, good drinkability with just the right amount of residual sugar notes.	4.41
2539	Last Buffalo In The Park	"The beer was black with a small beige head.
Strong aroma of alcohol, with coconut, chocolate, and vanilla.
The taste followed the nose precisely.
I was a little taken aback at first. The alcohol was almost overwhelming. After sitting for a while, however, the beer became quite enjoyable.
Unquestionably a dessert beer."	4.47
2540	Last Buffalo In The Park	2017 version Poured into a snifter. Medium brown color with a small tan head. Smooth bourbon, chocolate, oak, and sweet coconut on the nose. Taste followed. All the flavors melded well and the coconut shined without overshadowing the other notes. Deserving of it's reputation.	4.49
2541	Last Buffalo In The Park	A bomber bottle (no date) poured into a TH snifter. Look- A deep black look with a finger or two of tan head. A nice lace around the glass and the head settle to the outside.. Smell- It screams candy dessert. Coconut, chocolate, vanilla and a neat mix of coffee. The bottle seemed rather boozy but the flavors really came out when it had a minute to breath. The barrel aging was like an afterthought..  943 characters	4.67
2542	Last Buffalo In The Park	"On tap:
Medium tan ring by the time it gets to me, some lacing above the slowly dropping black body’s surface.. The coconut is prevalent early, but not overpowering; rich coffee notes provide the counter to this. There’s a little caramel to toffee sweetness sneaking in as it warms, pushing the coconut aside much more than the coffee.. Taste starts with that caramel note, not too strongly sweet. The coffee barrels (no pun intended) in and makes the opening note seem more like a splash of flavored cream added to it. The coconut hits at the edges with a bit of alcohol bite - almost like rum-soaked coconut. Moderate heft with a slightly sticky feel countered by a fairly aggressive carbonation..  865 characters"	4.46
2543	Last Buffalo In The Park	Look: Pitch black, with a finger of dark brown (almost reddish) head that quickly reduces to a ring.. Smell: Sweet cinnamon rolls, coconut, and chocolate. It smells like a dessert.. Taste: Following the nose, sweet coconut and chocolate with a hint of bitterness underneath. A little roast malt follows, but the coconut and chocolate are predominate..  636 characters	4.44
2544	Last Buffalo In The Park	22oz bottle poured into a snifter. A-pours dark black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that reduces to a ring around the edge of the glass. S- coconut and chocolate bomb up front, as with Last Snow, it smells just like an Almond Joy. Consistent rich coffee undertones enhance the chocolate note, soft notes of caramel and toffee follow. The barrel is subtle, but can definitely detect a bourbon note on the finish.  1,150 characters	4.66
2545	Last Buffalo In The Park	Appearance - The beer has nrownish black in color with a tan head.. Smell - The beer had a coconut & rum nose, which was seemingly somewhat mind.. Taste - At the front, the coconut is smooth and creamy with all of the distinct characteristics of coconut. The coffee notes were fresh and sweet. Though I am not a fan of rum, the rum was well valanced and brought out some of the nuances of the coconut. The overall profile was sweet but not cloying..  648 characters	4.69
2546	Last Buffalo In The Park	"Bottle shared by Chalumeaux, thanks for the opportunity.
Sweet sugary maple with bits of coconut, Rich vanilla and creamed coffee with an earthy spicy oak and bits of bourbon and brown sugar. Great mix of flavors F N tasty."	4.45
2547	Last Buffalo In The Park	03/2015 - the coconut opens up as it warms, lots of chocolate, some roastiness, bourbon for days on the nose; the palate has a decent amount of coconut and bourbon, wee vanilla in back too. Semisweet, fairly thick body for an imperial porter.	4.46
2548	Last Buffalo In The Park	I dont particularly like coconut so I should have no business drinking this beer. But I wanted to tick a top 250 and this was low hanging fruit.. L- Teku pour. Black, fizzy 1 finger head.. S - massive. So much bourbon when I cracked it. As it airs out in the glass I'm left with the same suntan lotion smell of last snow. After briefly airing out in the glass it literally smells like the same beer because ALL that you smell is artificial coconut..  678 characters	3.36
2549	Last Buffalo In The Park	Appearance - Pours black with a nice thick tan head lost of lacing around the glass.. Aroma - Lots of coconut, milk chocolate, oak, not getting much bourbon in the nose, mild vanilla.. Taste - Taste is amazing big coconut, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon comes out much more in the taste but is very well balanced. Getting some of the barrel this is like a liquid mounds bar..  652 characters	4.59
2550	Last Buffalo In The Park	For a barrel aged offering this is pretty well balanced ... coconut flavor is front and center, and might be overpowering for some palates , but the barrel flavor also makes its presence known. Not overly sweet	4.31
2551	Last Buffalo In The Park	"A: The beer is nearly jet black in color—only slight traces of dark brown are visible near the edges of the glass. It poured with a short tan head that left a large patch of beige bubbles on the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Strong aromas of toasted coconuts are present in the nose. As the beer warms up, hints of bourbon also become noticeable.
T: Like the smell, the taste has strong flavors of coconuts along with hints of vanilla and dark malts.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. It drinks more like a stout than a porter.
O: This porter is exceptionally drinkable for a beer that is 11.5% and has no traces whatsoever of alcohol in the taste, although it is complex enough to sip and savor.. Serving type: bottle"	4.47
2552	Last Buffalo In The Park	Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.. A: Very dark brown to nearly black, and for all intents opaque. Forms a thin tan head with low visible carbonation.. S: Amazing - coconut, coffee, and chocolate in waves. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla buttressing. Some dry woody tannins linger in the background. Really nice..  1,025 characters	4.48
2553	Last Buffalo In The Park	L: Had this beer on-tap at Brewmasters, poured into a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy, tan-colored head that lasted an above average amount of time. Good lacing.. S: A big, enticing aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, coconut, and coffee.. T: Tasted of a good amount of roasted malt (mostly in the finish), a bit of coffee, a light hops presence, a ton of chocolate, some coconut, and a bit of bourbon (and the accompanying barrel). Like the aroma, the flavor is big and bold, with a lot of complexity. Extremely well-balanced and flavorful. One of the best porters ever..  798 characters	4.65
2554	Mexican Brunch	Poured into a tulip glass via bottle. Color is rusty mocha brown. Smell is cinnamon and coffee.  326 characters	4.69
2555	Mexican Brunch	"Liquid dessert!! Awesome notes of coffee .. cinnamon adds a creamy feel, Chilies come forward as it warms . Very balanced , i appreciate how this doesn’t go over the top sweet— it has the right amount of fudgey notes, followed by a bitter bite while
Still being and creamy smooth! As a milk stout, I appreciate that this has enough body without being too thin or overwhelming."	4.74
2556	Mexican Brunch	I've had this bottle on my wish list for a while - probably since the first time I tried Abraxas. I'd hoped it might be similar, or even better.. Mexican Brunch isn't exactly what I'd hoped, but it does have a very pleasant balance - the chilis are mild, while the nibs have more of a baker's chocolate quality - not too cloying, not too sweet, not too spicy. It's quite pleasant - I certainly prefer Abraxas, but this is a very nice beer as well. I appreciate that the carbonation isn't super aggressive - it's very easy-drinking.	4.21
2557	Mexican Brunch	"L - pours a surprisingly translucent brown coming out of the bottle, but settles into something much more opaque with dark cherry red fringes. I guess this is ""only"" a porter after all. Creamy, whipped cream tan head with some aggressively sticky lacing. Leaves a fine film on the edges of my glass. The head color is simply divine.. S - burst of chile pepper with spiced hot chocolate and cinnamon powder. Getting the usual spice suspects a la cardamom, nutmeg, and allspice. Nails those Mexican Hot Chocolate vibes.. T - fresh and lively flavors of iced coffee, chili powder (sans heat), and cool whip. Sharp dark chocolate, two creams, and brown sugar. Whipped cacao butter. Maple smooths out any harsh chili heat, and we're just left with pepper flavor, none of the undesirable spiciness..  1,575 characters"	4.63
2558	Mexican Brunch	09/2017 - The nose is out of control - cinnamon, coffee, cardamom for days; amazing flavors akin to the nose with some spice; solid mouthfeel for an imperial porter; lactose, roast goes on and on!	4.42
2559	Mexican Brunch	"From Labor Day weekend notes:
Gentle to moderate pour yields a 3/4 inch tan head over a dark brown body with nice lacing.
Nose of maple, cinnamon, and coffee.
Taste mirrors nose with the chilies coming through very nicely.
Nice feel and overall, I'm grateful I finally got to try this bad boy.
Cheers!"	4.48
2560	Mexican Brunch	Pours an almost entirely dark color with a bigger, soft beige head, collapsing to a coating ring of lacing.. Smells of toasty coffee beans dipped into maple syrup, topped off by a generous amount of cinnamon. This creates a complex, earthy impression, countered by warm chilies and chocolaty bitter cocoa nibs. A milky, soothing, flowery note evolves from this, emphasizing roasted coffee with a sweet edge to it.. Has a very silk, lighter mouthfeel to it, with a helping thickness from the syrup, complimented by a low level of carbonation. Makes the beer easy drinking, while, at the same time it provides an ongoing, long lasting flavor evolution on the tongue..  1,321 characters	3.7
2561	Mexican Brunch	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Aroma has fresh roasted coffee, even crushed coffee beans. Taste has bittersweet coffee with sugar, quite balanced flavors, malty background, light chili heat on the finish.	4.5
2562	Mexican Brunch	Enjoyed at the Copenhagen Beer Fest. Reviewed from notes.. A - Poured a nice dark brown almost black with a thin mocha head.. S - Aromas of HUGE coffee and cinnamon, simply bursts out of the glass. Just a little bit of chile..  527 characters	4.74
2563	Mexican Brunch	There's a lot going on here and it's all good. To me chocolate stood out the most with cinnamon and coffee in the background. I was looking for a bit of spice but couldn't find it. A delicious beer but I think I prefer the simplicity of Morning Bell. nb	4.5
2564	Mexican Brunch	2017 vintage. Wow. This one is off the charts delicious! The head is modest but it is a beautiful deep dark brown with a small amount of khaki head that fades into a light ring around glass and patches of foam on the surface. I find the coffee and cinnamon are most prevalent on the nose but you get a hint of the chocolate. The flavor is just remarkable, coffee, cinnamon, chiles come through first, the maple and cacao are on the finish which is just smooth and delightful. Kane knocked this one out of the park.	4.66
2565	Mexican Brunch	On tap at the brewery.. Poured a very dark brownish black color with a hearty mocha colored cap. Bubbly carb, light lacing.. Cocoa and spice, some coffee, sweet maple..  496 characters	4.21
2566	Mexican Brunch	"**
11/21/17. On tap at Brewery.. A little disappointed. A nice medium spicy stout, but lacking the thickness and superior flavor of Sunday Brunch..  630 characters"	4.4
2567	Mexican Brunch	A: deep black to chocolate the best fit creamy small white bubbles Caramell to Brown’s head frothy like a cuppa coffee that’s been blended with an immersion blender. S: Literally smells like everything on the label I get maple I get sweet cocoa I want some hints of coconut Chili’s subtle spice dark chocolate hot chocolate. T: Spicy hot chocolate creamy melted chocolate called in the refrigerator for an hour and 23 minutes.  740 characters	4.34
2568	Mexican Brunch	2017 release. Drank on 10/16/2017 out of belgian style tulip.. Look: poured black with small, foamy head. no overflow after opened like many others experienced with these release.. Smell: cinnamon, coffee, maple, cocoa. great smell on this one..  774 characters	5
2569	Mexican Brunch	Pours near-black with a mocha head.. The nose and taste resemble Morning Bell with less coffee and some cinnamon toast crunch and smokiness. Very drinkable for the ABV. The mouthfeel is medium.. Overall, this wasn't as mind-blowing as I expected it to be but it's still a 9+/10. I prefer Sunday Brunch.	4.48
2570	Mexican Brunch	Pours a touch thin but that is to be expected considering it is a porter. Sits cola brown and opaque in the glass with light khaki foam around the edge of the glass. At first the smell is lactose sweet but as it warms up you get some strong chocolate notes and just a hint of chili pepper. The smell did not prepare you for the explosion of taste when you finally sip it. Sweet chocolate on the front end with a sweet cinnamon Center. Not really any heat to speak of but there are some pepper notes. Not really any specific maple flavor but it is definitely sweet. It feels a touch watery but still has a modicum of body. Overall this beer is excellent. Tastes more like an Italian capuccino than a Mexican stout but I am not complaining.	4.48
2571	Mexican Brunch	2017 vintage. Not a gusher.. A: Pours very dark brown with a finger of khaki colored head. Very good retention with a solid ring and some swirls of foam.. S: Cinnamon and coffee feature, alongside dark dry chocolate, noticeable red chili, maple, and light roastiness..  788 characters	4.55
2572	Mexican Brunch	2017 vintage. I won the lottery! Then we all got our money back! Kane is ridiculously awesome for doing that. For the record, 1 of my 5 bottles ended up with the surge problem. Still tested the same great taste.. So this is Morning Bell, which I love as is, with maple syrup, cinnamon, and chili.. L: 2F tan head with moderate retention. Leaves little lacing, but a cap and ring. Beer is jet black..  1,060 characters	4.77
2573	Mexican Brunch	this is a killer beer, quite deserving of its highly regarded status, and a pretty righteous use of maple syrup, but i think i just like their sunday brunch better. i lose quite a bit of the coffee roasted bitterness here to the spiciness of the chilis and the cinnamon. i mean, there is amazing balance between all the added ingredients here, and you can surely appreciate each element on its own as well as appreciate its contribution to the whole, dont get me wrong, but i liked the simplicity of the coffee and the maple too. the cocoa adds a nice bittering low end along with the roasted malt, and i get a unique floral honey thing in here too, odd in such a huge and flavorful and dark beer, but there it is. the cinnamon is warming with the alcohol, and the maple makes this wintery and cozy. its not overdone, but its awfully flavorful, and probably as close to the line with adjuncts as i like to get most of the time. still really maple forward, but not as driven by it as the sunday brunch is. cool beer, powerfully flavored, neat balance though, and smooth and rich to drink on. these guys have blown me away in limited exposure, i need to find a way to get more of their beers in me! as good as any of the more well known beers made in this style...	4.4
2574	Mexican Brunch	"Tap at Copenhagen beerfest
Smaller head, dark black color
Nose loads of coffee, fresh roasted coffee, espresso, little cookie, roast and chocolate
Taste loads of roast, char, coffee, espresso, fudge, chocolate, little pepper, cinnamon, cocoa, caramel
Mouth is thick chewy, good carb"	4.5
2575	Mexican Brunch	Very good beer! Very dark, light tan head. Smokey, coffee, chili aroma. taste was much better. Creamy cocoa-covered raisins with a hint of chili in the background. Not as good as Sunday Brunch, but not more than a step or two behind.	4.84
2576	Mexican Brunch	I had this on draught at the brewery. It was served in a goblet. It pours jet black with f full finger of beautiful, mocha-colored head and delicate lacing that coated the inside of the glass and didn't subside. The nose is sublime: milk chocolate, fresh coffee, and vanilla with a whiff of smoke and Mexican peppers. You can smell it from several feet away. The taste is magnificent. The first sensation is chili and cinnamon; it's bold but not overpowering. There follows roasted malt, chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, and hints of vanilla and nuts. All of the tastes individually are delicious and they blend very well. The mouth feel is fairly viscous and creamy, with moderate carbonation, and you can feel the 9.2% ABV. Overall, Mexican Brunch lives up to its accolades. It has even more flavor than Sunday Brunch and is simply a delicious and fun beer to drink.	4.66
2577	Mexican Brunch	I'd heard the chatter about the 2017 gusher bottles--and holy hell I can't believe there was a full refund to purchasers even though testing showed there was no sign of infection, just some nucleation from the spices--but my bottle was cool as a cucumber and didn't even begin to fizzle up as I opened it.. The pour is deep brown with black ribbons, filling to black, with a very large, dense creamy tan foam settling to a persistent creamy tan blanket with a clinging soft collar.. As it pours, an abundant, enveloping aroma of freshly ground coffee fills the room! Coming in closer, deeply caramelized brown sugar spikes up--identical to intentionally burning it at the bottom of the pot when prepping for Mexican coffee. A touch of vanilla with darkly intense and brooding notes of cinnamon bark nears fried French Toast, but also pulls towards savory mole, yet stays in between both somehow, with a faint hint of roasted chili smoke..  2,616 characters	4.51
2578	Mexican Brunch	"Look: Dark brown/maroon with thin off white head. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Cinnamon, coffee, hint of maple, cocoa powder, and brown sugar.
Taste: Cinnamon, cocoa powder, a little heat from the chilles, subdued bitterness, cocoa powder, and brown sugar.
Mouthfeel: Medium and creamy. Smooth but tons of flavor.
Overall: My favorite Mexican style porter."	4.74
2579	Society & Solitude #5	Picked up some cans at the brewery at the end of August. This is a tasty vermont IPA, hazy but not gritty. Excellent mouthfeel for the style. Great tropical aromas and flavors but this came in just a touch behind Double Galaxy for me. Good beer no doubt.	4.12
2580	Society & Solitude #5	Grapefruit aroma jumps out of the can when you pop the top. Hazy and juicy in the glass with a nice, silky head. New England fruity hop flavor blends with the bite of New Zealand hops. The long sustained taste is absolute heaven.	4.5
2581	Society & Solitude #5	I had this on draft at HF in Oct of 2015. I just found this on some notes I had made. I am putting in some review numbers so I can keep a list on BeerA so I can find what I have had at HF. So this rating really doesn’t count if you read this.	4
2582	Society & Solitude #5	Pours bright yellow and hazy, with an appropriate amount of head.. Smells like a pineapple made sweet love to a passionfruit.. Tastes of gentle grapefruit bitterness right away that's balanced with the right amount of malty sweetness..  556 characters	4.63
2583	Society & Solitude #5	Pours a medium hazy orange, quarter inch silky cap. Aroma has lots of soft melon, pink grapefruit & orange. Palate is stronger on the grapefruit, a little bit of pineapple, very delicate with little bitterness.	4.47
2584	Society & Solitude #5	L - 1-finger dense, creamy offwhite cap of a head atop a gorgeous, orange juice body.. S - grapefruit, pineapple, herb.. T - incredible grapefruit flavors. Juicy flesh, bitter rind, with a touch of balancing dankness. Clean middle, with a dry finish. Moderate bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness..  395 characters	4.42
2585	Society & Solitude #5	Appearance - Pours slightly dull opaque yellow with a dense white head. Strings of lacing around the glass.. Aroma - Aroma leans to a slightly sweet citrus with a nice grain aroma. Mild mango light tangerine, mild dank weed aroma, not much bitterness.. Taste - Ripe mango, citrus peel, the New Zealand hops are prominent. Nice earthy taste mild floral flavor, great ripe citrus flavors..  495 characters	4.56
2586	Society & Solitude #5	Berries, white grape, tropical fruits, pineapple, passionfruit, citrus, grapefruit, some caramelized malt, floral, earthy dankness, medium plus bodied	4.77
2587	Society & Solitude #5	Pours a cloudy, attractive gold color with a 2 finger, dense bright white head. Great looking.. The aroma is light and fresh with notes of grapefruit and tangerine, though not too sweet.. The flavor follow the smell with well-balanced, light and fresh citrus and tangerine flavors with a hint of florals brought on by a semi-sweet light malt base. The finish is clean with orange notes..  587 characters	4.62
2588	Society & Solitude #5	Pours golden and hazy. Immediate fruity aroma fills the room. The beer starts as nice as it smells, but then ends a little empty and bitter. This is my favorite of the Hill Farmstead beers I've tried, but not my favorite beer. Still worth buying when it's available.	4.48
2589	Society & Solitude #5	One of the prettiest beers I have seen in a while, this pours a hazy orange juice color with a nice two fingers of head. Head lasts a while before breaking leaving generous lacing.. Smell is really quite tropical and fruity. I'm getting a sweet citrus and melon dominance with a touch of a pith or pine in there too.. Taste is a follow-through of the nose, with the sweet juicy tropicals coming through strong. It seems kind of a hoppy fruit juice. Bitterness of pith and pine on the back end..  824 characters	4.56
2590	Society & Solitude #5	drank from 12 oz can poured into tulip glass, a little over 4 weeks old--- no sign of weedy old hops, still very fresh tasting....delicious brew---nice balance of upfront fruitiness, pineapple mostly w a little grapefruit, followed by balancing mellow bitterness...Nice!	4.56
2591	Society & Solitude #5	12/2013 - Big pineapple and orange nose, with some grapefruit lingering; large hop body with resinous notes dominating, and fruity grapefruit in the back; tangy bitterness on finish.	4.48
2592	Society & Solitude #5	"Serving: Can
Canned: Aug-27-2018. 
A:
Pours a hazy chamomile tea-color with a finger or so of white head that drops to a film. Ok retention; moderate lacing. (4). S:
Sugary tropical fruits and underbrush. Mango, candied orange peel, a little lacquery alcohol. (4.25).  1,214 characters"	4.39
2593	Society & Solitude #5	Almost fully opaque yellow-orange with a thick, convex white steamed milk-like froth settling in lumps with some spotty leopard lace.. Smell is dank, spicy and peppery with tropical notes of pineapple, passion fruit and peaches, ending with light biscuit.. Taste is apricot, green mango, kiwi and pineapple with spicy eucalyptus and pine, as well as a bit of toasty cracker on the swallow..  479 characters	4.23
2594	Society & Solitude #5	"A: Poured into a tulip glass to a hazy bright yellow topped by a finger of dense white head which retains well and leaves excellent lacing as it recedes
S: Smells of huge juicy citrus and grapefruit to the point of smelling like grapefruit juice
T: Taste is smooth and malty before the grapefruit comes in with full force. Very juicy but also slightly pithy with a touch of sweetness. Swallow is more juicy grapefruit and citrus with some lingering citrus zest on the finish.
M: This beer has a medium body with carbonation that is just slightly prickly while the beer finishes on the oily and refreshing side due to all the hops along with a little sweet malt.
O: Overall this is a top notch DIPA. Great flavors and some decent complexity though the grapefruit note is definitely the star of the show. A very clean and balanced DIPA as well. One to try if you like citrusy DIPAs and can get your hands on it."	4.62
2595	Society & Solitude #5	A: Pours a light orange-yellow with about 2 fingers of white head. A: Smells like a nice, ripe, freshly peeled tangerine. T: On the first sip, you pick up lots of citrus; grapefruit, tangerine are the first two that come to mind. Very faint bitterness on the end..  411 characters	4.5
2596	Society & Solitude #5	Growler filled January 2015; drank 1/29/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Cloudy light yellow appearance.. HUGE white head; thick lace..  297 characters	4.34
2597	Society & Solitude #5	Very cloudy straw appearance with white head. Aroma is a nice grapefruit citrus with a hind of hops. Taste is a very pleasant grapefruit citrus with hops that has a slight bitterness	4.75
2598	Society & Solitude #5	really smooth and juicy! great nose with just enough dank and plenty of orange/citrus.. a little pop of grapefruit on the tail end of the taste ... again everything is really balanced and nothing is overdone. not too heavy, but not thin on the mouthfeel either. this one is so damn drinkable	4.49
2599	Society & Solitude #5	poured from a 12oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a hazy, milky orange with a thin layer of head. smells of grapefruit and a bit of pine. taste has strong grapefruit flavors with some piney bitterness to back it up. feel is heavy, lower carb and full. this really is alcoholic grapefruit juice in a can. it doesn’t get overly fruity though as the combination of hops compliment each other to a balanced and citrusy yet dank & resinous DIPA.	4.52
2600	Society & Solitude #5	Got it fresh at Hill , excellent beer..... great taste very smooth ... sweet finish, touch of honey... cirrus overall slight bitter ...... will be having again	4.33
2601	Society & Solitude #5	Pours an opaque pale orange in color with a finger+ of pillowy white head. Aroma is a bit on the muted side but I get pineapple, grapefruit, orange, and mango. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma; lots of smooth tropical fruits with a touch of citrus and pineapple sharpness, finish leans lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is perfectly pillowy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This is an excellent beer, it's near perfectly balanced and super drinkable. I wish I had grabbed more than one growler.	4.66
2602	Society & Solitude #5	"Tap at The Farmhouse Burlington.
Slightly hazy dark yellow with a good sized long lasting head. Rich earthy citrusy grapefruit and pine with bits of sweet bread to counter. Very tasty clean well made brew."	4.11
2603	Society & Solitude #5	Tasted from draft. Pours a super cloudy pale orange with thick white head. Tons of lacing. Aroma is big time tropical fruit. Notes of mango, passion fruit, pineapple and orange. Taste is incredibly well balanced. Mild to moderate bitterness with malt backbone. Really no bitter bite at all. I really think non IPA drinkers would love it. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel with no hint of alcohol. Flavors of oranges, grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, pine, biscuit sweetness. Incredible IPA.	5
2604	Miami Madness	On tap at Lulu's in Allston, MA.. Looks like a well-made NEIPA in the glass with a lovely stiff-peak eggwhite head that retains surprisingly well for the style. Aromas scream passion fruit, mango, and guava. Just a hint of pale malt character coming through. The passion fruit is strong in the flavors, too. Perhaps a hair on the tart side, had a bit of an apple cider vinegar character. Refreshing and quite drinkable. I definitely have my qualms with beers that are so heavily fruited they just take like unsweetened fruit spritzers, but I have to respect this one for how damn far they took it. This seems to be a slightly different recipe, the ABV is now 7%.. 88/100	4.39
2605	Miami Madness	Amazing how much fruit goes into this beer. Tastes a bit sour, but also sweet with loads of mango, guava, and passion fruit. This was tart, but not too acidic - an amazing balance of flavors. Love the bottle art as well.	4.63
2606	Miami Madness	Aroma doesn’t have too much working on it besides your typical citrus funk & dry yeast found in Berliners...taste has lots of bright guava, just the right level of tartness but just a little too much saccharine / sugar on the back palate	4.42
2607	Miami Madness	On tap at Blind Tiger at the New Year's Eve party. This is pretty much a perfect Berliner-style in every way. Tart, but not sour, with a nice, fluffy feel, and so drinkable. An incredible beer all around.	4.61
2608	Miami Madness	04/2016 - JWB's sours are a bit too acidic and borderline harsh for me - I think it's the guava - and this was no exception; but I do appreciate all the fruit, namely the passionfruit and mango that pops abound.	4.1
2609	Miami Madness	The beer pours a some what hazy gold with a thin white head that recedes immediately. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, mango, guava, and passion fruit. It tastes tart, tangy, with mango, orange pulp, guava, passion fruit, and strawberry. The feel is medium is light and dry. A good sour from J Wakefield.	4.44
2610	Miami Madness	Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Cycle Brewing goblet.. A: A: hazy to murky yellow, with low visible carbonation. Forms a two-finger white head that fades fairly quickly.. S: A big punch of fruit up front - mango and guava and pineapple. Musty with some funk. Lactic tartness and wheat-cracker malts..  1,132 characters	4.46
2611	Miami Madness	Had this at Aslin's second anniversary. The look is an unmistakable pinkish purple color and the taste is quite different. If you aren't into sour type beers, you might pass. For what it is though, you will likely find no better.	4.53
2612	Miami Madness	This beer exceeded all my expectations. Last years batch. The nose is incredible on this.. Look: nice orange look, juice like.. Smell: Smell is the best part of this. Great passion fruit nose. Smells sweet.  371 characters	4.91
2613	Miami Madness	Great Berliner, see little wrong with this one except it there is not much beer. It is a little tart but fruit takes over everything which for some people is a great thing. I wish there was a little bit more beer then a mango smoothy. Still crazy nose and great flavor though.	4.35
2614	Miami Madness	Poured from a bomber into a J. Wakefield snifter glass.. Super hazy, OJ-looking yellow-orange body with a nice frothy white head that reduces to leave leggy lacing and a layer of retention.. Aroma is straight guava juice with passionfruit and sour citrus. Taste is very pulpy and tart but not super sour with tons of guava, passionfruit, melon, TROPICAL, lactic sourness, tons of citrus, a little grassy, perfectly drinkable with a light body. Super crisp and refreshing. Hard to not drink really quick..  588 characters	4.68
2615	Miami Madness	NOW we're talking!!! Poured this and honestly thought it was a hazy NE IPA. Absolutely beautiful to look at. Starburst orange color that just pops. Aroma is unreal....guava, mango and passion fruit galore. Taste is exactly as the nose....ALL THE FRUITS plus a side of tartness please!! Feel was spot on....dry yet refreshing. Could drink this ALL day!! Overall, this is THE BEST berliner I've ever tasted.	4.88
2616	Miami Madness	Wow, total mango quava delight. Barely any head or retention, but beautiful color(s) and fruity as can be on the nose and palate. I poured in three separate phases to enjoy the spectrum, clean first pour, clean with dreads second pour, and dread only third pour. Got to say I liked them all. Met the hype, and worth the hunt!	4.6
2617	Miami Madness	"5's across the board. No doubt about it. This blows all other Berliners I have tried right out of the water.
L: looks just like an orange juice/passion fruit juice. Great, bright, solid dark-yellow appearance.
S: This is where it hit me hard! HUGE aromas of passion fruit and guava right up from. The mango is perfectly evident as well. Citrus. Nice subtle funkiess. One of those things that make your mouth water just smelling it.
T: Fantastic! Great heavy flavors of passion fruit and guava with a nice sour/tart funkiness. Sour mouthburst was not too subtle, and not overpowering, so it was easy to work my way through the whole bottle. Again the mango was evident but backseat to the other two fruits.
F: mouthfeel was just smooth enough (not too sharp), and the aftertaste was tart and juicy.
Overall, this was one of the best beers I have had this year. I was already a big fan of passion fruit, but this beer really nailed it. Wholeheartedly worth the effort to get this, and I will be pursuing more of this in the future!"	5
2618	Miami Madness	One of the best berliners I've had. Aroma of fruit and a little tart, but the flavors were really where this brew shines. The slight tart and funk was an excellent companion to the tropical fruit flavors. Made everything just pop on the palate. Delicious	4.78
2619	Miami Madness	2016, batch 2, drank on 12/21/2016. Look-almost looks like a hazy ipa or pulpy orange juice. Smell-not getting anything bold but it smells citrusy and tart.  385 characters	4.5
2620	Miami Madness	Basically straight fruit juice. With the low abv on this, it should honestly be packaged in fruit juice boxes like Hi-C instead of bottles. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I like my beer to at least register some level of abv.	4.34
2621	Miami Madness	Opaque peach-orange with a thin white ring.. Smell is seedy passion fruit with spicy tangerine, peach, apricot, and herbal juniper.. Taste is really smooth yet tangy guava+passion fruit+mango that combines into a deliciously unique and tart peach-tangerine character, finishing semi-wet..  642 characters	4.2
2622	Miami Madness	"Tons of guava, unique but not my cup of tea.
Aroma was heavy on the fruit/ citrus.
Taste was surprisingly a bit to sweet guava was throughout. I could have saved a bunch of time and just got guava juice.
Glad I got to try it but not going to be seeking it out again."	3.31
2623	Miami Madness	really well done berliner type with tropical fruit. its one of the better fruity berliners i have had, and one of the best uses of these fruits i have seen in any beer, and while i loved it, im not sure it ranks among the best beers i have ever had overall, and wasnt even my favorite beer from j wakefield, although its probably still deserving of most of its hype! doesnt look like much, orange and hazy, quite thick for a beer so low in alcohol. the aroma is shocking, intensely sour, acidic, mouthwatering, puckery, all of it. with the passion fruit leading the charge, but the other fruits quite authentic and obvious in the aroma as well, juicy and intense, really different from other beers, more and more fresh. the flavor matches the aroma, with a real intense fruity complexion, passion fruit and orange and mango for sure, all really alive and bold in here, but never too sweet. thats the brilliance i think, keeping it dry. it doesnt feel light to me though, lots of body and texture, and even the high acidity doesnt lighten it up much. surprised its so clean too, gone but the palate begs for another gulp as soon as it is swallowed. this is not a style i usually flock to, especially with these fruits, where more often than not its gimmick over quality. this is awesomely delicious, a leader in its class no doubt!	4.37
2624	Miami Madness	Golden yellow color.. This is straight juice. Pineapples and oranges. Mango and papaya. Some sourness and tartness.. Light bodied. Acidic. Lemony..  175 characters	4.5
2625	Miami Madness	Pours lemon-yellow chalky liquid with minimal carbonation from the fruit additions. The aroma and flavor are tropical and tart, this beer is glorious, and everything I hoped it would be. Worth the hefty $	4.49
2626	Miami Madness	Bottle shared by Daniel. Thank you!. Light golden body with spotty effervescence. Upon a second pour, the beer is cloudy yellow. Aromas of lemon, star fruit, pineapple, guava. Juicy flavor with medium tartness, leaving a light puckering sensation. Delicious.	4.71
2627	Miami Madness	Wow, this beer is all over the board, in a great way. So much flavor to process. The mango and guava jump out, the balanced tartness keeps it refreshing. The aroma take a bit of a sweet cooked red onion aroma, but it's not unpleasant. This beer was a wakeup amid a small tasting. I'd call it a must-try.	4.43
2628	Miami Madness	Wow, my new favorite Berliner. This is a lovely combination of tropical fruit with the just the right amount of juice and pucker. Seek this out without hesitation. Perfect warm weather drinking.	4.75
2629	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Currently ranked #24 in the Top New England IPAs and #1 in the Top Louisiana Beers List. Currently #109 overall.. On-draught @ Avenue Pub, New Orleans, LA. $7 for a 6oz pour.. APPEARANCE: No head. Pulpy yellow-orange body. Not so much hazy as turbid and murky..  1,188 characters	3.46
2630	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	12oz bottle. Pours less than a finger of white head into my snifter. Retention is average, but leaves behind nice initial lacing. Body looks like OJ. Looks pretty good so far, for a hazy.. Nose has some punch to it, that’s for sure. A load of dankness hits you right in the mouth. Juicy as well, grapefruit, mango, pretty standard. Maybe a touch of guava. Somewhat sweet. I mean it smells good, but I’ve done this song and dance before, nothing new..  1,313 characters	3.67
2631	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Tasted from a crowler. Pours a super murky orange. Looks like orange juice. Thick white head. Aroma is big time citrus. Super juicy taste with citrus and some tropical notes. Minimal bitter bite. Very crushable. Excellent.	4.94
2632	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"Had a crowler of this over the summer. Shared with two other people.. Poured into a Trillium tulip....this is one of the haziest, most opaque beers I've ever seen. Bright yellow orange in color with a white/off white head that lingers. Looks ""sticky"".. Aroma of grapefruit, orange rind and tropical fruit abound. Not as assertive as I thought it'd be but I find that some beers with insane hop amounts tend to be a touch muted on the nose..  995 characters"	4.64
2633	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Really hazy yellow color with short live off-white head. Aroma has intense juicy fruits like ripe peaches, apricots and mango. Taste follows with sweet and juicy fruit notes, some biscuits, a hint of vanilla, slightly astringent on the finish with a light bitterness. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. True hop juice.	4.55
2634	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"Opaque orange so I'm told - I'm color blind but my wife and sister in law swear it looks like orange juice.
It smells like what nostalgia tells me Five Alive smelled like: overwhelmingly citrus with heavy orange and tangerine notes.
Mouthfeel is out of this world - velvety creamy. It's as if they used nitrogen even though I know they didn't.
It's as hoppy as you'd expect a double dry hopped ipa to be, but super juicy with citrus throughout.. TLDR: it's a slice of fried gold"	4.64
2635	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Canned 11/14/18 and tasted ~1.5-2 weeks later.. A: Pours light orangish-pale with a smattering of bright white head. Completely opaque haze. Minimal lacing and below average retention.. S: Bright orange and tropical hops, a bit of white grapefruit..  544 characters	4.43
2636	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	If citra is your thing, this is where you want to be. Super juicy. An awesome example of this hop's flavor, highlighting it with a nice medium level of mouthfeel. The head is not overly eager and fades fairly quick to a ring around the edge of the glass. This is much smoother than the regular GITM and an improvement on that beer in every way.	4.54
2637	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Beautiful beer. Pours a bright turbid straw yellow to orange. Thick bright white head on heavy pour. Nose is sherbet like. Orange peel and juice. Taste of citrus. Notes of orange, grapefruit peel, lemon zest and peaches. Honestly one dimensional as in I really only get those citrus notes. But they are huge! And delicious. Creamy silky body that’s easy on the tounge. Hoppy finish to close out this beer. Ya no kidding right? 8lbs per barrel so it better finish hoppy ;)	4.59
2638	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Looks perfect, gold hazy body that has a nice thick, creamy feel and light bitterness. Nose is fruity, taste is juicy as you would expect just from looking at it. One of the few that live up to the hype.	4.94
2639	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"10/21/19, from a can released late September (~3 weeks old): 'Taste' rating upped from 4.25 to 4.5 for a touch more creaminess at the front of the palate, and some incense/onion/herbal hop tones further accentuating the back end. Balanced to the point of understatement, but enabling a level of universal approachability few NEIPAs reach (especially with a DDH treatment); this beer sits casually at the peak of the style, with few others as level or refined.. 
Came across this one purely by chance recently, and was pretty excited to dig in.... Bottled on 9/14/18.  1,596 characters"	4.5
2640	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Simple put this beer is perfection. Rich, creamy, smooth while bursting with tropical juice goodness. The balance is perfect which is what separates the truly elite beers above the rest. Wish is was available all the time....	5
2641	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"The Gold Standard Gulf Coast IPA. 
Why is Beer Advocate showing DDH Ghost as retired? It has been released twice in Q4 2018 and will continue to be released on a rotating basis"	5
2642	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Absurdly opaque yellow-tan with a minimal, bubbly white blanket.. Smell is sweaty mango and peach with dank af cannabis and a hint of biscuit, while taste continues to bring on mango, mostly green, with a touch of pine, and even more juicy peach.. The medium-thin body has a smooth, crisp carbonation that expands to a filling froth before a bone dry finish..  423 characters	4.03
2643	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"12oz bottle with a date that's hard to read but it's there and i'm pretty sure it says ""Manifested on 9-18-18"" (or something close).
Totally opaque and surely the most NEIPA of any ""NEIPA"" I've tried to date when it comes to the hazy train. Murky pale orange/yellow color...hard to describe. 1/2"" white head with falls to a cap rather quickly. No lace.
Juicy with pineapple and berry aromas. Oranges too and grapefruit - the red type.
Orange-pineapple juice. It's good but that's what it is...not much complexity.
Full bodied and round mouthfeel. Very easy to drink and very little bitterness. Some heat. A touch of a drying out of the mouth affect late.
It's very good, but I'm at a 4...no more."	4
2644	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	merky af, sludge status. bright white head is fluffy and leaves some nice lace. pleasant aromas of lemon, grapefruit, mango, dankness, pine. palate follows with a candied fruit melange up front - peaches, orange, mango, grapefruit coming to mind. bitterness provided by grapefruity and piney bitterness on the back end, some herbaceous danky notes. the mouthfeel is thick, pretty fluffy but borderline chalkyness as it warms.	4.58
2645	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	A - Opaque medium orange gold color with very little lacing and no carbonation.. S - Very juicy red grapefruit with a shot of pepper on the nose.. T - Juicy grapefruit, a little pithy, nectarine, and peach. Finishes with a distinct citrus bitterness with spicy, peppery fruit rind. Nice lingering spicy citrus on the palate. A little bit of alcohol pokes through..  546 characters	4.34
2646	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Fresh bottle poured into flute.. Pours like thick grapefruit juice. Clouded and opaque, yellow straw. Bubbly head is just off pure white. Settles into ring around the glass with some sticky lacing.. Aroma is big burst of juicy citrus. OJ, zest, grapefruit rind..  571 characters	4.56
2647	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"Had this one days after the release but just realized I didn't review it. Easees enough, for my preferences it was perfect in every way.
Poured a turbid golden yellow with two fingers thick white head.
Citra hops snack you in the face! Citrus, pineapple, a bit dank.
Taste followed to a tee.
Medium to full body with good carbonation levels.
Overall perfect for me."	5
2648	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	One of the best hoppy beers I have ever had. It is sticky and so citra forward that it crushes your palate. I can't tell you how awesome this beer is.	4.88
2649	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Bottled 9/14/18, enjoyed on 10/5/18. Color is a beautiful, milky yellow that I couldn't see through if I tried. Aroma is fairly mild, but pleasant. Taste is Citra with gusto, delivered with excellent body. Fantastic beer.	4.41
2650	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	Pours an opaque yellow color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is vert tropical, lots of mango and peach aromas along with pine and spice. The taste of the beer is creamy yet hoppy, not overly bitter but juicy. The feel is smooth and again creamy. Overall it's an excellent IPA!	4.41
2651	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	The beer pours a murky yellow with a thin white head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of mango, orange, citrus, and papaya. It tastes of mango, orange pith, citrus, and papaya. The feel is medium full. A great IPA from Parish.	4.61
2652	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	L - 1/2 finger offwhite head is stubborn and refuses to budge. Body is a near-opaque, milky yellow.. S - tons and tons of grapefruit, herb, pineapple, a little something floral.. T - oh my. Citrus upon citrus upon citrus. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange. A small layer of dank, a bit of meat, then some intense earthiness. Moderate bitterness. No sweetness. Low booziness..  521 characters	4.53
2653	Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped	"Huge thank to JBowenGeorgia for this
12 oz bottle, dated 9/14/18, poured into a teku. A- A hazy golden straw with a two finger white head.. S- Citrus, pineapple, tropical fruits, dank, lime zest..  358 characters"	4.7
2654	Pirate Paradise	Thick, black pour. No head, negligible carb. Smells like rum and coconut... taste is similar, with a healthy dose of chocolate. Big body, just dripping with flavor, but composed perfectly. Outstanding	4.93
2655	Pirate Paradise	Bottle dated 07.25.2019. From a 12 oz. bottle into a PAA Pirate whiskey glass, this beer pours out with a blackness and forms a pinky worth of caramel colored crown that doesn’t stick around long.. The nose brings botanical rum notes mixing with some marshmallow like vanilla, a fudgey chocolate and a hint of coconut..  1,011 characters	4.61
2656	Pirate Paradise	I hate this beer. I just paid $10 for 1 12 ounce bottle of it and that would be fine if it was great but I hate it! I usually love dark beer. Even in the summer I'm ordering whatever porter or stout is at the bar. This one is all wrong. It claims to be vanilla coconut. I dont taste either. It just taste like any other dark beer but with an awful hard to swallow bitterness. I'm so annoyed with this beer right now. If it hadn't cost $10 and if it was 13% alcohol (something I didn't realize until after I bought it) I'd have thrown it out already.	2.31
2657	Pirate Paradise	10/2016 - Amazing coconut, light rum, graham cracker, marshmallow nose; a ton of vanilla, creamy, light coconut too on the palate; incredible mouthfeel, semi-sweet finish; creamy, coconut, vanilla, rum goodness.	4.74
2658	Pirate Paradise	Batch 1 that Ive been holding onto for a while. First thing I noticed was the strong vanilla aroma. Very strong, in a very good way. Has a fudgy,vanilla, taste w a strong after taste of toasted coconut. And has ABV hidden well. Overall right on par w bourbon paradise. Prairie might be making the best stouts right now .. Alongside w Toppling Goliath. Damn do I wish I could get this often.	4.99
2659	Pirate Paradise	The beer pours Pitch Black with a thin khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of coconut, vanilla, marshmallows, and rum. It tastes of toasted coconut, vanilla, marshmallows, and rum. The feel is medium light, sticky, and incredibly smooth. A great barrel aged stout from Prairie, tons of flavor but so drinkable.	4.69
2660	Pirate Paradise	Two of my friends recently put together a share to help me out after my bottles were stolen at Dark Lord Day. I told them it really wasn't necessary, but that seems to have even motivated them more! So we ended up drinking several top 250 beers, which is always exciting for me - I was stunned that they managed to grab a Pirate Paradise though. I'm a very big fan of Bourbon Paradise, and a huge lover of Prairie beers in general - this was certainly a wish list item!. So, it's a little odd to say that I was slightly let down by Pirate Paradise - particularly as difficult as I'd thought it was to find and procure. Strangely, it seems that bourbon seems to complement the base beer much better - which is exactly what I would not have thought. Rum and coconut beers are some of my favorites - so why didn't this one work quite as well for me?. That's probably not exactly a good or accurate statement, honestly, because Pirate Paradise is a damn good beer - but where Bourbon Paradise is almost TOO thick and sweet, this beer falls just a little short in those categories. Rum in the nose and the taste are pleasant, but it's definitely a bit thin in that. I'm also not getting the coconut and vanilla to nearly the same degree as in Bourbon Paradise. Quite surprising, I know..  1,388 characters	4.58
2661	Pirate Paradise	"S: seeet chocolate and coconut cream with a touch of rum
T: omg! Amazing combo. Awesome chocolate, coconu, vanilla and smooth rum. Damn! What a combo!!
F: smooth, thick, just barely carbonated, awesome drinking"	4.93
2662	Pirate Paradise	12oz bottle, served in a stemmed glass. Pours a thick, oily dark black body, one finger white head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Smell is sweet rum, vanilla, sugarcane, milk chocolate, a bit of sweet coconut, cocoa. It's mildly boozy, but rum is more or less always that way. Flavour is chewy milk chocolate, cocoa, a bit of sweet and oily coconut, more milk chocolate, a smooth and extended run of rum throughout, with a smooth, mild vanilla sweetness lingering on the backend. Mainly it's vanilla and rum mingling together on the backend, which is rounded out by a slight cocoa-like bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial, lower but still appropriate carbonation, mildly boozy rum on the finish. A very good barrel-aged adjunct stout that isn't quite pastry stout level but it's an excellent stout in its own right. Probably one of the few rum barrel-aged stouts that I have really enjoyed. I do agree that this one is a step up above Bourbon Paradise as the rum seems to work better with the adjuncts than the bourbon.	4.49
2663	Pirate Paradise	2018 release.. A: Viscous black with a thin ring of fine, dark brown head. Decent retention and no lacing.. S: Toasted coconut, vanilla ice cream, with moderate spiced rum, cinnamon, and a bit of dark chocolate and roast..  604 characters	4.7
2664	Pirate Paradise	"Big shout out to my buddy Donnie for this gem and my 1500 check in. Look: motor oil black, little head a very dark cola like color
Smell: big rum nose with hints of fudge and vanilla, the coconut comes through a lot as it warms up
Taste: big rum up front, with a perfectly balanced vanilla, fudge and coconut taste.
Feel: thick full mouth feel, very little carbonation.... like drinking a coconut fudge cake."	4.68
2665	Pirate Paradise	Very dark appearance with tan slight tan head. Aroma is malt with vanilla and coconut. Taste is also a coconut and vanilla with a slight rum taste with a significant alcohol aroma. A little more aging would help.	4.69
2666	Pirate Paradise	A: Beer pours a very black body. Very little head or lacing, as common with Prairie stouts. Head color looked almost like a Cherry Coke. Very dark red colored head. Look was very typical for a Prairie stout.. S: Large amounts of rum at first pour. As the beer warmed some of the rum aromas gave way to some sweeter smells. Vanilla, chocolate, and coconut become more noticeable as the beer got closer to room temperature.. T: Very nice balance of rum flavors mixed with multiple layers of dessert like tastes. Similar to the nose, the beer is very heavy rum and molasses in the beginning before somewhat dissapearing to give way to sweeter flavors. Nice amount of vanilla and chocolate mixed with some coconut as the beer gets warmer..  1,238 characters	4.97
2667	Pirate Paradise	Beautiful rum soaked brownie batter. No booze. The best beer ever, even though it doesn't taste like beer. Truly sublime. The absolute best liquid I have ever tasted or smelled, and it's not even close.	5
2668	Pirate Paradise	A fantastic variation of the tried and true BOMB! I might rate the 2015 Pirate BOMB! over the Paradise, the Paradise does beat the 2016 Pirate handily.	4.4
2669	Pirate Paradise	Drank in a snifter on 8/26/2017. Look - pretty much pitch black, decent lacing, very little head, some flakes floating around that are either coconut or consistent bubbles. i say coconut. :). Smell - coconut potent for sure. nice milk chocolate, hint of vanilla and oak.  880 characters	4.6
2670	Pirate Paradise	12 oz bottle. Poured in Prairie stemmed glass. Looks great. Smells of rum and coconut...decadent. Taste is insanely good! Coconut, vanilla and rum. Amazing beer.	4.9
2671	Pirate Paradise	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a yellow/orange prairie Dino glass.. Pours a deep brown body with a light brown head that reduces quickly to leave a ring.. Aromas of strong coconut and vanilla, run and milk chocolate.. this is straight chocolate covered coconuts..  474 characters	4.84
2672	Pirate Paradise	Easily the best from Prairie yet. Jet black, with minimal head that disappears very quickly. The vanilla coconut rum nose and flavor last throughout the entire beer, and the mouthfeel is thick and lasting. Must try!	4.97
2673	Pirate Paradise	A lot of hype surrounding this bottle as the best Prairie BA stout ever....I love prairie BA stouts and I have been lucky enough to try most of them. This one is extremely solid but I think Pirate Bomb is better. Great but not worth the $150-$170 secondary its bringing.	4.62
2674	Pirate Paradise	Poured from the bottle into a taster. Huge coconut with some sweetness from the vanilla and rum barrels. Superior mouthfeel to any other Prairie offering I've experienced. Well done!	4.78
2675	Pirate Paradise	There really isn't much to dock here. Probably if not definitely taken over as the best Prairie beer I have had. Nose is just stupid complex with sweet rum and vanilla and getting some toasted coconut and robust char notes. Taste fully follows with a rich creamy mouth feel. Outstanding!	5
2676	Pirate Paradise	L: Poured into snifter. Weak ring of dark khaki head, very little lace. Solid black.. S: Roasted cocoa, brownie, dried coconut in the nose, predominantly. A little of the rum barrel.. T: Chocolate, coffee, barrel-sweetness. Coconut and vanilla are merely undertones, most noticeable in bigger gulps. Only a bit boozy at the very tail end..  577 characters	4.41
2677	Pirate Paradise	Bottle pour at Churchkey in D.C.. Near black body with no head. Lovely aroma of chocolate, rum, perhaps fruity note, maybe raisins. The flavor is just insane. Silky smooth and shockingly delicious. Wow. I would relish the opportunity to have this again.	4.81
2678	Pirate Paradise	Poured into a pint glass. A Beautiful opaque-brown color with a thick tan head. Rich notes of cocoa, coconut, vanilla, and cherries. The taste followed closely. Nicely balanced roasted chocolate., coconut, fruit, and vanilla. The ABV was well-hidden - just a beautiful beer with a creamy feel and smooth aftertaste.	4.34
2679	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Drank on 9/19/2019. Traveling hotel beer - this was an excellent treat after a 12 hour day at work. Sweet, light, and fragrant. Beautiful orange, opaque pour, very hazy. Quite good.	4.27
2680	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Absolutely phenomenal beer, and my favorite Trillium IPA (or APA, or IIPA) to date.. Had on tap with lunch at the beautiful new (ish) Fort Point location. Beautiful, hazy, golden-orange body of pure juice, soft soft, off-white lacing (almost no head with a to-the-brim pour).. Aromas and flavors are absolutely stunning with massive citrus, mango, pineapple, and white grape. Fairly grassy but massively juicy with absolutely no astringency or hop burn. The honey sends it over the top for me, as I like a little extra sweetness in my big IPAs. But there's some honest, resiny, pithy bitterness in the background that keeps things semi-grounded and lingers quite nicely along with the fruit juice sweetness. So many bold notes at play here, and they come together amazingly. Dangerously poundable for an 8.5% beer..  927 characters	4.54
2681	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Cutting Tiles (mosaic) pours a hazy, golden honey color with a well formed, tight knit, one finger head that sticks around. The smell is backed by a big floral note and juicy citrus fruits with a scant sweetness. The taste has an excellent mouthfeel, soft and smooth over the palette with citrus and tropical fruits shinning through. There is a rich sweetness from the wild flower, raw honey and just enough hop bitterness to balance this double out.	4.6
2682	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Poured from a 3 week old can gotten from my daughter who mulled it from Boston. Thanks K! Poured into my Tired Hands teku glass.. L: A super cloudy medium golden with hints of orange color. Decent glass lacing they recedes.. S: Notes of huge tropical fruit with mango, pineapple, guava and some honey sweetness..  671 characters	4.5
2683	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Can (one off from De Bierkoning) @ home, 24 days after canning. Murkey yellow golden colour Somewhat frothy off white head. Aroma's of dank hops, onion, resinous bitterness. Retronasal it's somewhat sweet, (very) dank hops, resin, juice. Flavour is moderate sweet with light bitterness. Medium bodied. Good carbonation. Long finish, light moderate bitter and orange soda (?). Great stuff (and a good burp).	4.36
2684	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass. Canned on 3/1.. Hazy orange color, like mango nectar with off-white lacing and some minimal effervescence. Juicy tropical fruit on the nose: mango, pineapple, some undertones of dank hops. Big flavors of peach and stone fruit to start, some topical fruit. Really mellow finish, perhaps due to the addition of honey. I might even get a hint of sweetness on the aftertaste if I’m not imagining it. Chewy smooth mouthfeel. This is a really enjoyable beer. It packs a punch but really hits on all cylinders.	4.67
2685	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	10/2016 - Massive Mosaic presence on the nose, with earthiness popping front and center, plus some honey; body is a bit creamier, nice honey notes too; intense hop bite at the end.	4.15
2686	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Picked this up at trillium in boston 10 days ago and drank one of them that night. It was very good but a bit bitter. Had another one tonight and it was bursting with juiciness and flavor. My mouth is watering. Might be worth leaving in the fridge for a week or two. This is one of the best trillium beers, thus the best beers ive ever had. Definitely the best double ipa ive ever had	4.82
2687	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	One of my favorite double IPAs. Trillium in Mass. got this one right. Brewed with raw local honey, the hop flavors in this hazy are amazing. Citrusy heavy.	4.6
2688	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Medium gold beer with a light haze and a few fingers of ivory white foam... 3/21/18 canning... One can produced a lot of chunky sediment, while the other did not despite being from the same batch... Go figure.... Anyway, fantastic brew - right up my alley: a DIPA coming in at 8.5% abv featuring the mighty Mosaic hop and raw wildflower honey... Soft and smooth and fruity, with honey imparting a richly flavored sweetness to the floral, tropical, and orchard fruit impressions... bitterness is very mild, in the typical NEIPA style, although this was not a fruit smoothie sort of IPA, as it did have a very subtle hint of dank resin buried under the soft ripe fruits and honey. Really dug it...	4.49
2689	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	"It tastes like beer mixed with copious amounts of honey. A friend of mine drove all the way to Boston, snagged a bunch of Trillium beer, brought them back to CT, and a sampling we did do. I wish Cutting Tiles wasn't the first one I tried. It reminded me of drinking Dundee's Honey Brown Lager back in high school. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment, but there were kids underneath playing laser tag, and I was afraid of spilling it on them. Imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in Cutting Tiles. I thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties, but the 4.5 point World Class reviews for this beer are completely misleading. I think the beer is just riding the coattails of Trillium's other quality recipes. I desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site. This beer is terrible. Save yourself the drive, buy a double Mosaic IPA that somehow tastes like a pilsner, and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go, Cutting Tiles. Also, if you like tea and honey, try tea and Cutting Tiles. Oh, and I heard they're partnering with General Mills to make Cutting Tiles Nut Cheerios. Honey Boo-Boo is changing her name to Cutting Tiles Boo-Boo."	1.36

Right now, all Raul needs is Miranda Kerr on his lap and he would be in perfection"	4.38
2691	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	"Draft at the brewery.
Presents hazy gold with a minimal head or retention. Dank and fruity in the nose. Garlic and onions with tropical fruit. Medium bodied with a tacky, slightly slick mouthfeel. Garlic-rubbed chives with ripe tropicals on the palate. Finishes with a lingering dankness, a medium bitterness, and a hint of sweet honey.. Nice beer but a bit heavy on the garlic and onions."	4.3
2692	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Poured a hazy orange with nice lacing... small head .... tastes of honey, mango, light pineapple... very juicy and smells all same .... ever so slight bitter finish more sweet honey ... great overall beer and can’t wait for more .... first trillium experience and couldn’t be happier	4.41
2693	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	A hazy lemon color with accents of tea. 1 finger of bubbly, puffy head that recedes to a line of bubbles.. Aroma is akin to ice cream, but with a dank, herbal, skunky aroma. Some rotting fruit rinds.. Flavor is very bitter, with hints garden dirt, rotten grapefruit rind, pine sol, lemon 409, herb, and harsh alcohol. Underneath, we've got the basic Cutting Tiles formula which is great - honeysuckle and ice cream. There is something very off about this beer's flavor - it's basically ice cream and lemon grout cleaner..  917 characters	3.58
2694	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	A 1 pint can, with strangely no visible canned on date (looks like it got cut off the side of the can). Can was also quite severely deformed on the top (my fault), which made it extremely hard to open, although I somehow managed it in the end. Doesn’t appear to have affected the beer with no leaks. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.. Appearance: A hazy dark orange colour with a half finger white head that dissipated quickly and left only sparse lacing.. Aroma: Orange, mango and pineapple with a hint of grass, caramel malt and booze..  817 characters	4.09
2695	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	This beer was solid. Not sure its world class but def i great beer. something about the color made me give it a 5 not sure if its the honey or what	4.58
2696	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Trillium is an impressive brewer and this beer is well developed but in my opinion not their best. Pipeworks has devised beers with honey far superior than Cutting Tiles/Artaic such as Sure Bet and even Spotted Puffer. Orange haze, decent head, underwhelming in flavor based on hype. Light/lacking in a zing that I was expecting. Another great beer from Trillium but my conflated expectations spoiled my experience.	4.64
2697	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	"L: Hazy orange, high level of opacity. Great fluffy head
S: Fruity to a fault. Piney quality all but absent; characteristic of Trillium's IPAs in my experience.
T: Delicious fruitiness, balanced, overwhelmingly hoppy but without the usual ""hop bomb"" bitterness. It might be confirmation bias, but the honey added during brewing adds a satisfying earthy sweetness.
MF: Pillowy; feels like it looks. It just feels good to sip this stuff- not heavy at all, but substantial in the most basic sense of the word.. Overall: One of the best IPAs I've ever had; succinctly states Trillium's case for the hype they receive. Were these beers not $9 for twelve ounces at their Greenway biergarten, it wouldn't be hard to tuck one away every fifteen minutes without ever getting tired of them."	4.86
2698	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Tasted from bottle. Pours a cloudy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruits and floral notes. Taste is very well balanced. Flavors of melon, pineapple, mango, caramel, floral notes. Very well done imperial IPA.	4.56
2699	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	16oz. can into a Heady Topper stemless pint.. Muddy look. Kinda dark too. Nose is citrus, starfruit and pineapple. Huge juicy dank tropical fruit notes. Beer opens citrus and starfruit. Sweet with a huge tropical citrus fruit presence. Aggressive with a touch of acidity in the middle. No hop notes to speak of. Finishes orange and pineapple juice. Real nice. Body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Prickly on the palate and goes down aggressive. Super drinkable.. Very very good if a touch one dimensional. The drinkability is off the charts though.	4.29
2700	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Not much to look at once poured into the glass. No backlit props - is just like to see a little more activity and vibrancy in the glass. Nose is wonderful - fruit bomb. I get pineapple and mango along with some nice true honey notes. Taste is almost overwhelming but the body keeps all those strong, sweet malts and late hops at bay.	4.45
2701	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Its amazing to say this but as great as this beer is its not even in my top 5 from Trillium. That's why Trillium is one of my favorite Brewery's. So good every time and this is another winner. So tasty and smooth.	4.35
2702	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Got this on delivery from a friend. Another fantastic offering from Trillium which is the best in southern New England the more I have of it. So many unique offers and this is another. Wish I had more!	4.65
2703	Cutting Tiles (Mosaic)	Canned two weeks ago.. A: Pours a light orangish gold with two fingers of foamy ivory colored head. Very good retention but minimal lacing.. S: A nice blend of mango, flowers, honey, orange with mild sweetish malt..  599 characters	4.5
2704	Blåbær Lambik	I have to admit this Lambik was difficult to attain and I had to pay. However, it was truly delicious. It was among the best Lambics, if not the best Lambic, that I've ever had. I also love blueberry, which certainly made this the perfect Lambic for me. It is unique and different yet similar to the best Lambics with its rich and tart flavors.. Look: dark purple with a pinkish finger thick head. Aroma: blueberry, lemon, oak..  584 characters	4.8
2705	Blåbær Lambik	"2019
Got to enjoy this in-house at Himmeriget about one month after i picked one bottle up at the release. It is one of the more underwhelming cantillons (tastewise I've tried) for me. Although it is still a very pleasant beer, not quite as good as 2018."	4.24
2706	Blåbær Lambik	My first experience of this was at Dark Lord Day, written below. I had a bottle at home so what follows first is my review of that 2018 bottle opened on Zwanze Day 2019.. Appearance is foggy vibrant burnt red with a tall uneven pinkish-white foam head that slowly settles to s thin film and creamy collar.. Blåbær exhibits tanniny skins and hella oak that has a nutty splintery dusty character. The lambic has an olive brine funk and is more sour than other loons, but it needs to warm up to develop away from vinegar with more pleasant notes of red wine as the prickly semi-dry finish becomes smoother as it warm..  1,035 characters	4.22
2707	Blåbær Lambik	2015. Enjoyed this year the most by a long shot. Most blueberry forward out of any vintage of Blåbær I have had to date. Other vintages being: '12 & '16	4.81
2708	Blåbær Lambik	2009 vintage. 750mL bottle poured into an oversize wine glass.. Pours a hazy maroon body with a light pink head. Aromas are bursting with blueberries and typical cantillon funkiness. Vinous, citrusy, woody, musty.. On the tongue was tart blueberries and fruit skins, barnyard funk and yeasty, musty basement. Oaky, jammy, tannic, citrus, lactic, lively, acidic..  424 characters	4.65
2709	Blåbær Lambik	2009 batch 2 bottle. Poured into a Torst glass. Dark blue/purple in color. Minimal head. So much blueberry! Smells amazing with blueberry and funk. Some mustiness in there too. Flavors are blueberry abound. Can’t believe how much fruit is present for a 9 year old bottle. Tons of blueberry with some funk. Super balanced. Feel is thick for the style, probably because of the amount of blueberry in it. Overall, this is fantastic. Just an amazing lambic!	4.74
2710	Blåbær Lambik	Cantillon Blabaer Lambik Vintage 2015.. Acidic, tart, funky, and tannic on the palate. One of the best uses of blueberries in any beer I have had.. Overall, a really nice fruited beer that requires far too much effort to acquire. Your life will not be worse without it.	4.5
2711	Blåbær Lambik	Rating the '14, drinking it side by side with the '17 which I would give a 3.75 at best...not sure what's up with the '17 or if I'm having a bad bottle. Drinking at Himmeriget (7/19/2017)	4.68
2712	Blåbær Lambik	Vintage 2015. A: Pours a dark purple, with a ruby reddish hue. Head is less than half an inch high with pinkish and blueberry highlights; good retention, and beautiful lacing. S: Plethora of blueberries amidst barnyard hay. Excellent funk presence with sensible bitterness that’s all very lively, earthy, and aromatic: lemons, oak, strawberry jam, raspberries.  802 characters	4.65
2713	Blåbær Lambik	2015 750mL drank on 4/22/2017. L-dark reddish, purple, thin and quickly disappearing head. S-fresh blueberries, oak, almost a raspberry note in there as well, funk....amazing.  589 characters	4.89
2714	Blåbær Lambik	2016 vintage at Himmeriget in Copenhagen.. Awesome looking beer, dark purple with lots of visible bubbles.. As soon as you open the bottle, the smell of blueberries smacks you in the face. Pouring it and sniffing into the glass shows what a great lambic is all about. The blueberries mingle with sour, funky notes, with hints of raspberries. I could smell this for hours....  698 characters	4.66
2715	Blåbær Lambik	2015 vintage from a 375 ml bottle at Himmeriget in Copenhagen. I've been wanting to try this one for a long time and this was the first one I went for off the amazing lambic list at Himmeriget. Super balanced, not too sour, and just so nice to drink. Lives up to its reputation.	4.5
2716	Blåbær Lambik	"2016 vintage.
Beautiful Dark ruby color, almost no head.
Aroma is moderate sour, red fruits, hay, barn, funky, lots of blueberries in the finish.
Very drinkable.
----------------------------------------------------------
A few moths later:
Pours deep red / ruby with small pink head.
Aroma has stable, hay, funk,
Taste is blue berries, sour lemons, tart, moderate funk, very dry finish.
L: 4.5 S: 3.75 T: 4 F: 4.25 O: 4"	4.42
2717	Blåbær Lambik	Lots of people told me to not believe the hype on this beer. I just think it's impossible to get the strong blueberry taste like you do with a peach or raspberry lambic. This beer was one of the best blueberry lambic/sours I've ever had. I had it along side a lot of different blueberry beers and this one was one of the top 3. the funk was soft and the sour notes were very light but it was very smooth and I'd definitely trade high for this again	4.75
2718	Blåbær Lambik	2013 vintage. Honoured to share this with JLindros in honor of his newborn son. Review 2800.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice slightly hazy blueberry juice hue with a light pink head that fades to leave sticky lacing and a thick blanket.. S - Aromas of incredible blueberry, berry skin. Excellent light funk, basement and cheesy funk, soft lemons. Really really fragrant..  767 characters	4.73
2719	Blåbær Lambik	Huge thanks to rudzud, the gem I've been trying to get for a while! 2013. Huge frothy head, pink blueberry thick head fades semi slowly with big lacing, slight hazy dark purple maroon berry juice color.. Nose is incredible! Loads and loads of blueberry, fresh blueberry and aged funky, great lambic funk, earthy tart sour funk, sour lambic tart berry skin, blueberry flesh, juicy as Hell..  722 characters	4.73
2720	Blåbær Lambik	2014 750ml.. Had a quarter pour side by side with a myriad of other blueberry beers. Big take away was I surprised how soft and not sour this was. Tart yes and still got that Cantillon funk. Got more berry flavor as it warmed. I've heard this beer is really over-hyped and compared to the other blueberry beers out there I still think this is a very special beer. Maybe bluberry sours in general are just not as flavorful and jammy as raspberry, cherry, apricot, etc. Proabably wouldn't seek it out again but was still a great beer to have.	4.54
2721	Blåbær Lambik	A 375ml bottle at Himmergiet of the 2015 Vintage. Poured into a mini wine glass.. Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy ruby red dark purple colour with a one finger pinkish purple head that had good retention and sparse lacing.. Aroma: Blueberry, tart, funk, some acidity and lemon..  629 characters	4.72
2722	Blåbær Lambik	Pours a rich bluish, purple with healthy blueberry yogurt head. Bottom of cork and nose smells like spontaneous funk with minimal barnyard mustiness but with healthy blueberry aroma. Taste is young lambic citric acidic sourness with big tannic presence, a bit of lacto, and slight but real blueberry undertones. Mouthfeel is full but the finish is very bitter and dry. Overall, this is one of the best blueberry beers I've had but it's a difficult fruit to conquer. Age would tone down the bitterness and let the lambic base come around but would likely diminish the amazing nose and kill the fruit from the taste. Great beer but I prefer many of Cantillon's other offerings.	4.63
2723	Blåbær Lambik	The blueberry taste was a little more subdued than I expected, but despite that it's still a fantastic beer. Goes without saying that it feels pretty cool to notch this one off my bucket list - it helps to have friends who are connected!	4.47
2724	Blåbær Lambik	"L: Deep, dark purple hue with a nice amount of carb retention after the pour. Gorgeous.
S: Tons of that lovely Cantillon funk with a complimenting undertone of fruit that smooths out the nose.
T: Similar to smell; perfect funkiness, and just the slightest hint of juicy blueberry. The most authentic blueberry flavor I've ever experienced in a beer.
F: Great carb level; does just enough to cut through the juicy funk so that the taste both coats and lingers for further enjoyment.
Overall, this lived beyond what I had expected. Blueberry is such a difficult flavor to impart into beer, and Cantillon, once again, blew me away. I'm stingy with chasing down hyped beers, but this is one I would recommend again and again."	4.85
2725	Blåbær Lambik	Bottle. I believe it to be 2015. Poured a ruddy, muddy purple. Almost wine like. A purple/pink frothiness that sits atop the beer. Aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer. Earth, vinegar, wood, and of course, a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe, tart blueberries. The flavor was probably not as complex as other Cantillon beers I have had but it was surely impressive and flooring. It starts off very tart. A bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine. I loved how dry it finished. Each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor. The body was light and the tartness lingered. Probably won't have this again so it was definitely a treat.	4.65
2726	Blåbær Lambik	Beer #4000 deserves something special. Huge thanks to DocJ007 yet again for the crazy beer he shares with us all. 375ml bottle from 2012.. Pours deep reddish purple with a one and a half finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small webs of lace on the sides of the glass.. Smells of sweet/tart fresh picked blueberries, the ever present Cantillon musty brewery funk, some mild lactic sourness, yogurt and finally some grains. Taste follows the same path with plenty of tart blueberries and lactic sourness up front followed closely by the must and finally the lightly chewy grains. Feel is slightly grainy quickly being enveloped by plenty of musty sourness and slight sweetness from the berries..  920 characters	4.64
2727	Blåbær Lambik	"375ml bottle of the 2015 Vintage.
Tried at Himmeriget, Copenhagen; 160 Danish Krone for the 375ml bottle
Excellent stuff from Cantillon & easily the best of the albeit limited selection of lambics I've tried so far. Starting with a nice cherry & raspberries taste, the blueberries came through strong soon after & there was plenty funk/tart too. An excellent balance & great mouthfeel, the beer had a lingering sourness that stayed with you after each sip; excellent stuff & a must try if you can find it."	4.45
2728	Blåbær Lambik	2015 vintage. Fruity smell, soft sourish, fresh, lightly sweet of the berries. It is a nice beer, but I like the regular seasonals more. Nice to have tried, but I won't trade for it anymore.	4.42
2729	The Rusty Nail	Known as the Last Nail in Idaho, apparently, I'm enjoying a 2018 vintage. Pours thick and oily into a teku, with a modest layer of slow-to-emerge cocoa-colored foam. Bitter dark chocolate and cassia on the nose, with vinous tannins and some very light smoke and iodine. Grape and cinnamon on the palate, dipped in chocolate fondue. Fantastically full mouthfeel, very smooth.	4.32
2730	The Rusty Nail	2018 vintage on draft. Aroma has lots of sugary malt syrup and whiskey barrel. Taste is bitter and roasty at first with background whiskey and wood flavor.	4.35
2731	The Rusty Nail	The pour is thick and dark. Not much head. Nice lacing though.. Nose is smooth bourbon, some malt and the faintest breeze of cinnamon. The presence of cinnamon is delicate and beautiful. Like oatmeal cookies or stroopwaffel that are just lightly dusted. That near 14% ABV is certainly present but not obtrusive, creating a subtle tension.. Now the taste is where it all comes together. The cinnamon comes in stronger and the bourbon takes a small step back to make way for it. All the while, the roast from the malt and the slight bitterness, almost a ghostly effect, from the licorice enforce balance from being too sweet. The alcohol level still is just being there, but not in the way. If you look for him you'll find him casually chilling in the corner of the room..  1,021 characters	4.68
2732	The Rusty Nail	"2018 bottle.
Pouring from a bomber bottle into a whiskey/tumbler glass, this beer pours out like a stream of coffee. It forms in the glass black with a bright brown highlighted rim. It wanted to form a crown of caramel bubbles on the pour, but never could muster it. 4. The nose carries in a bourbon barrel that wants its presence known. It shows dark fruit; raisins, dates and plums alongside a dry oak, light leather and vanilla tannins. The cinnamon is at the party, but deciding if it wants to dance yet. 4.25. And with one sip, the cinnamon jumps off the wall to dance, providing an ever so slight spicy tingle. It doesn’t take long for the barrel to come back in with its dark fruit. Loads of chocolate paints the background and stays throughout. I think the licorice adds to the overall taste, but it’s not something that would be picked out if not noted. The only time I’m able to tell it’s there is maybe on the finish with a little lingering candy sweetness. 4.5.  1,794 characters"	4.41
2733	The Rusty Nail	"22 oz. Bomber
Red Wax/Capped
2019 Limited Release
ABV: 13.9%. Poured into a Tree House glass a very nice dark brown/black color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy/fizzy/quick one-finger tan head, which leaves a very nice medium oil slick, and some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is very nice, malty, hoppy, with some chocolate/toffee, bourbon, vanilla, licorice, with a pretty nice touch of cinnamon, oaky. The taste is very very nice, malty, hoppy, with a very nice touch of chocolate/toffee, some really nice bourbon, vanilla, really nice touch of cinnamon, licorice, oaky, with a really nice sweetness. Full Body, ABV is hidden very nicely, very nice creamyness/silky, a very nice sipper, a very nice complex brew. Overall, this is a very tasty brew, the best from this brewery for me so far. Hopefully, I can find another bottle, now."	4.91
2734	The Rusty Nail	22 oz. bottle poured into a teku glass.. Near black with a thin light brown head.. Nose: Licorice and cinnamon dominate, Bourbon barrel is present but more of an undertone..  456 characters	4.62
2735	The Rusty Nail	This is a big and tasty oatmeal stout with a lot of flavor. The alcohol is noticeable (it is 13.90% after all) but it is a warming alcohol flavor that blends well with the sweetness and strong bourbon flavor. It is delicious for slow sipping.. Look: Black with a fluffy two-inch thick mocca colored head. Aroma: bourbon and chocolate.  466 characters	4.68
2736	The Rusty Nail	Thanks to JLindros for sharing this bottle. 2018 vintage.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave sticky legs.. S - Big aromas of cinnamon and black licorice. Nice lightly smokey malts, subtle bourbon. Very pleasant base beer but not much barrel notes..  770 characters	4.56
2737	The Rusty Nail	"2018 vintage, shared with rudzud
Pours a small dark head that fades almost instantly, thick inky oily black beer, long thick legs. Nose like a typical super dark dark black stout, heavy roast and a bit of char, tons of roast and a bit of charred cocoa, dark chocolate, some cinnamon and a bit of licorice anise, some vanilla from phenol spices of the roasted malts and a bit of the barrel, but no bourbon, dark chocolate fudge, touch of coconut barrel notes. Taste more of the super rich dark stout, this time a bit of bourbon barrel juice in there as well, some cinnamon with spice heat as well, very little licorice thankfully, rich dark malts with some roast and char, fudgey super dark charred roast, bitterness more from charred malts than from hops, baking spices, some alcohol warmth and flavor somewhat smooth but quite obvious and a bit hot, dark chocolate cocoa, vanilla, creamy rich vanilla and a little barrel baking spice, intense malt, sticky mild drier finish, more warming alcohol and thick fudgey cocoa as well as some cinnamon and vanilla.  1,345 characters"	4.56
2738	The Rusty Nail	2017 version poured into a snifter. Based on some of the ingredients noted on the label of the bottle (cinnamon, licorice) I was not expecting to like this quite as much as I did. I loved how thick and smooth this was with no single ingredient taking over. I couldn't keep myself from finishing the entire bottle on a Sunday night.	4.75
2739	The Rusty Nail	"Rusty Nail 2019 from the bottle on 6/22/19:
Cinnamon, anise, roasted malt, raisins, and licorice. Flavors and nose grow and layer as it warms. Stunning and outstanding."	4.62
2740	The Rusty Nail	Bottle, poured into stemless Teku.. Black and full bodied, creamy pour. Head is thin layer of dense dark tan foam. Like cappuccino cap stirred into the espresso.. Aroma is sweet, fragrant cinnamon, bourbon and earthy floral vanilla..  549 characters	4.46
2741	The Rusty Nail	pours a dense black with a thick dark brown head. head leaves nice thick dark brown rings around the edges and swirls in the middle. smells like cinnamon whiskey lovely nose on this beer. taste is a complex mix of cinnamon, dark fruits, slight chocolate and malt. get a little bit of that black licorice awkwardness on the back end, but it works. gives it a rooty, herbal, earthy aftertaste. i dig it. feel is on point. mild carbonation and full on the tongue through all the way down the gullet. overall, this is incredible. very impressed with what fremont does with their barrels. and in such great quantity. highly recommend!	4.63
2742	The Rusty Nail	2018 barrel-aged imperial oatmeal stout (14.5% abv)... Brewed with licorice and cinnamon bark and aged in bourbon barrels... This thing is sick... Chocolate, molasses, licorice, and bourbon deluxe - hint of cinnamon... Niiice...	4.5
2743	The Rusty Nail	22oz bottle from 2018 which came out in June 2018 but doesn't have a bottle date. Poured into a tulip at 51°F.. L: Pours black with virtually no head. What little bubbles exist are a dark brown. Looks black except at the thinnest edges and generally looks completely still.. S: Cinnamon, brown sugar, licorice. A little alcohol as it warms up. Not a very strong aroma for this type of beer..  1,240 characters	4.19
2744	The Rusty Nail	Really enjoyed this one, lots of flavor and balance - the smokey-ness is only very light present.. THX Chad for sharing this one with me. I never would have traded for it, because it was unknown back than.	4.66
2745	The Rusty Nail	"A: pitch black, dark brown head that lingers
S: Cinnamon, dark chocolate, sweet milk chocolate, light oak, hint of licorice, bourbon, cocoa
T: Perfectly integrated cinnamon, cocoa, bourbon, oats, light licorice, light roast, hint of fresh fruit
M: Creamy and thicker but still easy drinking
O: Best beer I've ever gazed with licorice. Cinnamon and licorice are perfectly integrated. Bourbon is present but lets the base shine. Alcohol is masked"	4.69
2746	The Rusty Nail	9/3/2018; well balanced -- as it warms the cinnamon and licorice start to dance nicely on the palate. Do not let the licorice scare you away -- Enjoy!	4.75
2747	The Rusty Nail	The beer pours Pitch Black with good lacing, and a medium beige head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of baker’s chocolate, molasses, peppermint, slight cinnamon, and bourbon barrel. The taste follows the nose. The feel is thick and flavorful, and very well balanced. This is a great barrel aged stout, thick and well balanced.	4.65
2748	The Rusty Nail	Black with half in tan head. Huge cinnamon nose, powdered sugar. Slight licorice. Taste follows the nose, sweet, cinnamon, licorice. Nutty and coffee notes at the end. Cherry once it warms. Bitter finish, somewhat dry at first though sweeter as it warms. Thick creamy mouthfeel. I'm having trouble getting over a note on the nose that reminds me of baby powder. This really holds the beer back for me. A solid brew nonetheless.	4.01
2749	The Rusty Nail	Half glass share, 2018 from the bottle.. Pours viscous, crude oil black with a thin and creamy dark tan foam. Surprisingly it stays well.. Amazing aromas once the booze disippates. Cinnamon and licorice with noticeable over a deeply toasted bread and brown sugar..  862 characters	4.79
2750	The Rusty Nail	What an epic treat. Not indulgent, rather epic. The melange of tastes and aromas combined with the singularity of mouthfeel that only Fremont can coax out of a stout is unreal.. I say it’s not indulgent or decadent because this isn’t a pastry stout - it’s a fucking beer. Malty, smoky and an appropriate almost hidden bitterness combined with never-cloying sweetness, earthiness and slickness. All with an underlying savory aspect complimented by warming alcohol.. Coffee, anise, oak and port wine. Luscious mouthfeel.	4.46
2751	The Rusty Nail	Thick and rich, almost like drinking a port. Dark in color, very thick in mouthfeel and a highly boozy flavor. Delicious dessert beer to be shared among friends.	4.56
2752	The Rusty Nail	2018 version on draft: aroma isn't much but it goes down so smooth and pleasantly sweet. Very good already. Can't wait to see how it ages and maybe grows that aroma little bit.	4.29
2753	The Rusty Nail	"2018-11-01
22oz bottle served in a tulip. 2018 release. Given to me by a friend at work.. Pours black, initially with a small head but it fades quickly to a small ring. Small amount of fine carbonation. Smell is rich, sweet, coffee, anise, booze, bourbon of course.. Taste is the same collection of flavors, but altered in balance, and with cinnamon added. Cinnamon seems to mute the anise and bourbon a little bit, which brings out coffee a little more. Sweetness is still very much prevalent..  560 characters"	4.15
2754	Pirate Bomb!	"2019-10-31
12oz bottle served in a WABL glass. Dated 07.19.2019.. Pours black with a small head, little carbonation. Smell is rum and lots of chocolate. Also booze.. Taste is cherry, rum, alcohol, some chocolate, some sweetness. Cherry flavor doesn't quite seem right, but it's not oppressive and everything else is pretty good..  504 characters"	4
2755	Pirate Bomb!	12 oz. bottle dated 7/7/19. Poured into Aslin anniversary glass and allowed to warm.. L: Pours black, barely any light brown head, which doesn't last very long. No lacing or cap and ring..  773 characters	4.51
2756	Pirate Bomb!	"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a small tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing. Based on the pour this one seems pretty low in carbonation,
S: Smells of a lot of coffee and chocolate with some vanilla and a hint of rum. Touch of peppery heat on the nose too,
T: Taste is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, peppery heat, some oak and rum barrels. On the swallow there's more rum barrel, chocolate, coffee, vanilla and some lingering heat.
M: This beer is pretty full in body with a slightly silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low end but still adequate while the beer has a slightly drying finish due to the ABV.
O: This beer is delicious. Great adjunct flavors with some nice influence from the base beer. Very well balanced and really nice barrel influence without overpowering the rest of what is going on either. This is definitely one to try if you can get your hands on it."	4.75
2757	Pirate Bomb!	"Pours pitch black, quite viscous and thick. Great chocolate aroma accented by some coffee and coconut. Tastes great. For 15%, it isn’t as sweet as I thought it would be. Loads of chocolate, sweet vanilla, light coffee, heat is light in the background, rum barrel aging works some coconut into the finish. Full bodied and delicious, a little pricy but worth trying once.... 10/12/19
12 oz bottle split with Dave at Butchers Block
4.5 rating"	4.5
2758	Pirate Bomb!	Poured from a bottle into a stemmed tulip. Pours black with a decent brown head that fizzes away quickly. Mostly rum on the nose. Faint hints of chocolate. Even as it warms the taste is mostly rum, tobacco, leather. Some chocolate and very slight vanilla sweetness at the end. A subtle warmth from the chilies and a little harshness from the alcohol, which is steep. Light to medium body. Would like a bit more balance as the barrel overpowers a tad. Great if rum is your jam.	4.09
2759	Pirate Bomb!	"look: Dark brown, cola highlights when held to light. Modest tan head with messy lacing.
smell: a nose bomb of roasty char, espresso, and dark chocolate.
taste: Much like the nose, a flavor bomb, great balance of bitter roasty espresso, and chocolate sweetness. Slight pepper burn in the finish. Amazingly drinkable for a rich and ballsy stout."	4.71
2760	Pirate Bomb!	Bottled 7/22/19. Poured at 55 degrees. Dark brown rocky foam briefly sits atop black liquid; no cap retention; barely a thin ring; no lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong spicy green chillies, rum and chocolate; hot boozy exhale. Taste follows nose and add vanilla, oak and mild roast coffee in the middle; rum soaked chocolate Mexican cake finish. Silky feel, medium body, moderate minus carbonation; warming from 15% ABV. Overall super well balanced, lots of heat from the peppers and alcohol with plenty of chocolate and vanilla to round out the whole; and the nose/flavors stay strong from first sip to last. Worthy of the premium price paid.	4.7
2761	Pirate Bomb!	(L) Pours pitch black with almost no head.. (S) Black licorice and booze.. (T) Candy aisle salted licorice drops. Faint on the rum but who cares?.  252 characters	4.93
2762	Pirate Bomb!	"Black, rich and Beautiful. Make Oprah proud. Smells delicious like liquor and chocolate. Sweetie. Licorice. That wonderful chili heat is smooth and away some tasty beverage. It'll make you lick your lips AND splash some up your nose inhaling it and another little sip. Holy Beer Hops! Right down the line. Got about a half full snifter. Mind Blown. Mouth feels it. I hear turbines spinning and I think we're about to go vertical very quickly. Clear the computer desk.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>SONIC BOOM>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>RIGHTEOUS GEM STONE FROM OKLAHOMA*******"	5
2763	Pirate Bomb!	Poured a black body with minimal khaki head that quickly died. Aroma has hints of vanilla and chocolate but mostly I get the chili/spicy peppers that hit me strong. Thick, sticky, chocolate sweetness with vanilla and boozy feel, a woody smoothness that belies it's thickness and coating on the tongue, and the spices/heat and booze do come out strong on the finish. A slow sipping and hot meal in a bottle.	4.18
2764	Pirate Bomb!	Bottled on 7/19/2019.Pours into a goblet jet jet black with a really thin deep mocha head that is gone as quick as it comes.Slight chili smoldering,roasted nuts,and dark chocolate in the nose.The massive complexity comes out in the flavors of the beer,that smoldering chili that is attached to a little smoke,chocolate,and vanilla tinged rum compliment that smoky chili element nearly perfectly,both intertwine in a lingering finish....Fantastic!I was mildly underwhelmed until I started drinking it,an awesome big stout worthy of ranking.	4.49
2765	Pirate Bomb!	Really a delicious BA stout, just a little too hot on the finish, wish it were maybe 12-13% ABV. Almost perfect though, nose and flavors are excellent.	4.93
2766	Pirate Bomb!	It looks thick and oily like all Prairie's great stouts. There's a little lacing that stays after the pour. The smell is getting me excited to taste it. It's relatively fresh with a 7/18/19 bottling date (today is 9/5.) I can smell a bit of the sweet bourbon character and I think a bit of the chillies. Otherwise it smells like standard Bomb (which is to mean that it smells great!) I just realized it has a 15% abv which means 12oz is probably a bit much for me on a weeknight, but it'll be worth it.. The first sips I get the peppers at a bit more than I expected, but not overly harsh. Prairie always adds the right amount of peppers just enough to give it a bit of a kick. I taste the sweetness too, but it's not cloying. The coffee balances it out well. As it warms I can taste the booze a bit more than at first. It might be a bit much for some people. I gave a Bourbon Paradise to a friend who likes BA stouts and she found that one to be too boozy for her. This would probably be the same case here. Perhaps it could use some aging to mellow. It is 15% after all, so I can understand the alcohol.. Overall it's one of Praire's best and should never be passed up. The only improvement I can ask for would be that it hides the alcohol a bit better, so I guess I'll have to buy another one and age it.	4.58
2767	Pirate Bomb!	Look and smell are undiscernabl3 from regular bomb. I'm getting no rum on the nose.. Taste is sweeter and less cinnamon and chili than I recall bomb or ba bomb having. Much more vanilla than the aforementioned. Rum is definitely there on the finish. It taste like clear rum and not spiced. Not overpowering like most rum beers but still a little too strong for my liking.. Feel is fine..  659 characters	4.02
2768	Pirate Bomb!	Incredible imperial stout that lived up to its hype - found this gem at an out-of-state supermarket. Pours a deep, dark, rich opaque black color with a little tan head and spotty lingering lacing. Very nice. Deep, rich aromas of dark chocolate fudge, medium roast coffee, toasted nuts, coconut, caramel, creamy vanilla, rum, oak and malt. Taste follows the nose, with an outstanding balance between the heavier rich flavors and the creaminess that balanced it out. Coconut was pleasantly in the forefront (as opposed to the recent Pirate Noir beer that I tried). Could have used a little more rum, but was nonetheless delicious. Definitely a sipper, there was some upfront warming alcohol but it was very pleasant. Smooth, sticky, chewy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just the right amount of carbonation. An excellent beer, one that I would seek out again.	4.38
2769	Pirate Bomb!	"L: Generic black color
S: Strong smell of spices and chocolate.
T: A smash of flavors binded together. Indeed a pirate bomb. Nothing smooth just a bunch of random flavors.
F: Very heavy and dank.
O: Decent random mix of flavors."	4.23
2770	Pirate Bomb!	shame i have to work tomorrow. it's already open though. motor oil black mess in the glass, with a thin khaki head that kicked up from a heavy hand. a few strings stick behind. taking a whiff there's a lot of milk chocolate, vanilla, coconut and funk, and just a mixture of things that burn the nose a bit. a bit of old coffee and a more mellow rum heat as it warms up. a nice evolution. taste came off a bit heavy on the sweetness at first, lots of the original bomb sings through here with a rich chocolate, vanilla and malt-y profile that has slowly warmed into some wood-like notes with a splash of rum. chilis kind of get lost but maybe they just join in with the general residual heat. could be better balanced but when i pop a 15% brew i only expect so much in that department. sip it slower it than i am please. make some dessert. pet your dog. it's a good beer and on par with prairie for me, tasty but wish i'd paid a buck or two less. cheers	4.27
2771	Pirate Bomb!	This is a wonderfully big stout! Vibrantly flavorful: dark chocolate, coffee, dark berries, red wine, oak, some smoke, cinnamon and vanilla. A comforting amount of booze.. Beautiful beer, pours almost black with a brown head and great lacing. Smells very chocolatey with warm spice. Smooth, silky feel.. Really enjoyed this beer!	4.58
2772	Pirate Bomb!	L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of creamy, tan-colored head that dissipated fairly quickly. Not a whole lot of lacing.. S: A solid aroma of malt, dark chocolate, coconut, chili peppers, booze, and vanilla.. T: Tasted of a small amount of vanilla (less than expected), a tinge of vanilla (kind of lingers around), a lot of booze (quite prevalent), a good amount of malt (present throughout), mild chili pepper notes, and some dark chocolate. This is a pretty aggressive flavor, but it has a nice subtlety to it. Tasty stuff..  791 characters	4.04
2773	Pirate Bomb!	"Received from @jdell15 in NBS BIF #9. Reviewed 8/4/19. Thanks Jacob!
“2017” printed on shoulder in nearly microscopic yellow numbers. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 54 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Dark brown, slight haze.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to the light, still opaque.
Head – Small (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), brown, fizzy, medium density, gone in a few seconds leaving neither cap nor crown.
Lacing – None. Not unexpected in a 15% ABV brew!
Aroma – 4 – Vanilla, rum. Moderately strong and lasts.
Flavor – 4.25 - Rum, vanilla extract, chilis, wood (but more like poplar than oak, i.e. less tannins and vanillin), very weak coffee, no coconut, no hops, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 4 – No head, no lacing, burns (alcohol + chilis) all the way down but ignites a curiously mild gastric warming. Flavor is overpowered by the heat. Otherwise"	4.09
2774	Pirate Bomb!	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Inky black motor oil pour. No head worth mentioning, possibly due to celalring... barely there lacing.. S: Dark chocolate, roasted grains, booze, and chilis..  603 characters	4.31
2775	Pirate Bomb!	"Bottled and surely this must
Be bottle conditioned but gushed when opened
Pours a jet black body but is headless though this might be due to being cellared
Aroma is dirty pirate hot chocolate, enough to get the mrs interested
Flavour is like the aroma"	4.47
2776	Pirate Bomb!	"This is a really nice treat. The rum is really nice addition to the already great Bomb!
Very drinkable despite the very high abv. The rum brings a certain hot character with the pepper. The coffee and cocoa are great.
Perfectly balanced beer"	4.6
2777	Pirate Bomb!	A - Pours pitch black with a one finger creamy tan head.. S - Aroma is dark chocolate, coffee and rum.. T - The taste dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, coconut, chillies and rum..  378 characters	4.49
2778	Pirate Bomb!	"12oz bottle, stamped bottling date information is smudged and unreadable, but likely either from 2016 or from 2017.
Black colored body, with a glint of mahogany backlit highlights. Aggressive pour results in half a finger of bubbly brown head, which stays around as a creamy, small bubble cap and larger bubble ring. All the lacing spots like to slide back into the body. The rising bubbles produce an active swirl at the beer surface, which is quite a visual show.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, with chocolate, chilles, vanilla, and the rum barrel. Coffee has faded, but the overall aroma is intoxicating (because of the high ABV% perhaps?)
Taste is rum infused chocolate, vanilla, and the chilles. The chilles leave a definite burn on the mouth, especially the tongue and throat. There is a sweetness from the rum and the vanilla. Digging deep there is still a touch of coffee flavor left. The alcohol wafts into the nasal passages.
Mouth feel is full and coating, which allows the chilles to take effect. Adequate supportive carbonation.
I am not a big rum barrel aged fan, but this beer is the exception. Full in its expression, and balanced among its components. Visually entertaining, and so good in its flavors. The higher ABV% is not an issue for tasting, and incorporates well with the other aspects of the beer."	4.56
2779	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through.	4.21
2780	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I'm a huge fan of Fremont's Barrel Aging Program, and even as Goose Island sold out, Bourbon County remains a brew to benchmark against. It is rare to meet a BA Stout of this caliber and this is exactly what we have with the BBA Speedway. It's good - better than BCBS on their off years. Maybe better than their best.	4.59
2781	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	On tap at the brewery. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. A nice barrel aroma along with some chocolate and coffee. The taste was as expected. Bright coffee up front followed by a hefty chocolate presence all wrapped in a bourbon blanket. Full bodied with a slick feel. Outstanding.	4.46
2782	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottled 10/30/13.. Nice dark pour, not too viscous but nearly black in color. Not too much head or lacing, but the color and appearance looks great.. Predominantly dark fruit and chocolate on the nose. Very, very mild oxidation, but that’s just me being picky. Hints of dark, roasty coffee on the back end..  578 characters	4.49
2783	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Tasted on tap at Ansari's Eagan, MN during Black Friday tap takeover. I tried this beer first and it was by far my favorite of the 4 sampled that afternoon. Thick, smooth and tasty. I've yet to be able to find a bottle of this in trade but sure glad I've at least gotten to try it now.	4.5
2784	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	08/2014 - This shit is crack; impressive bourbon, caramel, cocoa, malts too up front; sweet, flavorful, bourbon, coffee, lactose, vanilla on the palate; solid mouthfeel that lingers.	4.46
2785	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	A little bit of a booze bomb so make sure you aren’t going anywhere if you have it. Nothing special about this one and was pretty standard when it comes to BA stuff.	4.23
2786	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Appearance: Dark brown bordering on Black The beer has has a fairly small dark brown head which faded to a ring.. Smell: Moderate Bourbon notes, coffee followed by brown sugar notes.. Taste: The Bourbon, coffee and brown sugar notes from the nose come through in the taste profile. I also get some fairly noticeable oak notes, and roasted malts. The finish is fairly dry..  511 characters	4.25
2787	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 vintage, on tap in a 10oz flute. Carbonation is subdued and the beer only has a very slight ring of dark brown head. Drank side by side with a Jamaican Speedway - these beers are quite easily distinguished in appearance and in taste, which surprised me a bit. I've had quite a few of the Speedway variants now and they all have their own very unique traits.. Barrel Aged Speedway has quite a lot of bourbon to the nose and taste. The coffee is rich and roasty, but not strong and lacks any acidity. The barrel is also quite present with a light, woody dryness.. To this day, I still think that Rye Vietnamese Speedway is one of the very best beers in the world - and bourbon barrel aged Speedway isn't far behind it in quality. I'd like to see what some age would do to this beer (but not too much - I had a 2013 recently that was tremendously oxidized).	4.66
2788	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	750ml bottle - 2015 vintage. Pours pitch black with a creamy brown foam head. Smells strongly of wood and oak, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark toffee, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, dried dark fruits, raisin, fig, coffee, dark chocolate, with earthy herbal grassy pine. Tastes pretty exquisite with a great blend of aforementioned flavors, oak barrel, bourbon, vanilla, caramel swirl, maple, dark toffee, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, dried dark fruits, raisin, fig, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, with earthy herbal grassy pine. Feels medium bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a real nice and rich bourbon barrel aged imperial coffee stout.	4.83
2789	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Tasted from 2013 bottle. Pours jet black with tan head. Not much head. Lots of caramel, molasses, maple, bourbon on the nose. Thick and chewy mouthfeel with a little alcohol heat. Flavors of bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, cocoa, coffee, vanilla. Huge complex beer that is incredibly well done.	4.78
2790	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2016 vintage. 750 mL bottle poured into snifter.. Black, thin tan head. Bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, and coffee in the nose. Excellent balance between barrel, coffee, and base stout..  370 characters	4.44
2791	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Had this on draft at the 2017 San Diego Beer Week at the brewery.. BBA Speedway stout has a great roasty malt flavor with a great amount of bourbon flavor.	4.84
2792	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2013 bottle now aged 4 years.. For the first time I'm appreciating oxidation in a beer. It certainly is but I'm strangely not put off by it. The coffee in its original form is long gone, but a shell of where it was remains with outlier elements of char, roast, and pepper.. There is still a large amount of sweetness and barrel in this beer. Loads of vanilla, carmelized sugar, toffee, brown sugar and bourbon..  600 characters	4.02
2793	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Description: Appearance is jet black, like the normal Speedway, with little to no head. Smell is full of oak but not so much bourbon. Coffee, dark chocolate and roasty notes are also apparent. The woodiness of the oak really comes through on the taste and adds a lot of earthiness to the beer. Taste is not as coffee heavy as the smell. Feel is more like a porter in that it's a little light for a stout. Minimal carbonation and smooth drinking.. Suggested food pairing: BBQ ribs. If you like this beer then you should also try: KBS.  781 characters	4.42
2794	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Black color with dark brown head. Aroma has slightly acidic coffee, even a bit green with some bourbon in the background. Taste is sweet at first, fudgy, continues with sweetened coffee and bourbon, a hint of green coffee bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Really nice variation of the base beer, adds a nice flavor complexity.	4.5
2795	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Dark cola brown in the glass with bits of light coming through the edges. No head lingers in the glass but there was lovely carbonation at first. Barrel and coffee comes through in the most but the barrel is not super pronounced. Roast, slight chocolate and vanilla and booze is there but well balanced and dare I say hidden. Taste is somewhat sweet with a roasty middle and followed by a woodsy back end with the slightest bourbon bite. Feel is kind of thin especially for the style. It has slightly more carbonation than is usual for the style but barely any objectively speaking. Overall a great beer that is very well balanced but could use some more body. Not a coffee bomb at all.	4.56
2796	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"2016 vintage poured into a snifter:. Pours like coffee with moderate khaki head with some retention
Smells like bourbon, chocolate, coffee, dark fruit
Perfect mix of barrel and base beer, like a mocha frappe
Velvety smooth, with a delayed bit of warming as it goes down
Overall, a bit short of BAVSS but a monster of a beer"	4.8
2797	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2/18/15 vintage. L - pours a dark paint brown with a beautiful mocha head. Mesmerizing honeycomb bubble structure. This'll do just fine in lieu of morning coffee on this north east blizzard morning.. S - huge roasty lactose character bolstered by the booze. Iced latte and a walnut nuttiness. Almost has a bit of tang to it..  1,073 characters	4.44
2798	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	On-tap 2/10/2017 at Natty Greene’s Tavern in North Attleboro, MA, served in a tulip glass.. A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a thin beige head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.. S: The aroma contains strong bourbon along with coffee, chocolate, molasses and a faint touch of hops..  851 characters	4.46
2799	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottle poured - bourbon, malts, coffee greet the nose. Thick rich black pour - first taste costs the palate with bourbon on front and rich coffee on the back side. The beer is well brewed - well done!	4.73
2800	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	great looking brew. pungent notes of oak, booze, caramel on the nose. very sweet tasting - milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, boozy bourbon, slightly bitter coffee & roasty malts giving some balance. mouthfeel is about where it should be but nothing exceptional in terms of texture. overall this was a very good barrel aged stout.	4.53
2801	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This beer pours thick and dark with an amazing brown head that fades after a minute or so but leaves a few globs of lacing behind. The aroma from this is heavenly. Tons of sweet, roasted malt with a massive amount of coffee and dark chocolate all with the most pleasant whiff of bourbon in the background. The taste is exactly the same as the aroma with the roasty twang of the malt being complimented by the coffee and chocolate and the bourbon coming in to bring it all together. This is as good as any BBA coffee stout I have had. It is a great beer.	4.96
2802	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours a thick black color with a tan head and fresh lacing. Smell is bourbon vanilla wood roasted malt ans chocolate. Taste 1st is rich mellow bourbon it is the star in this stout it is supported nicely by vanilla and chocolate roasted malts hints of coffee, this stout is a very forward bourbon barrel but i really liked it, thick mouth feel with lingering roasted malt dark fruit bourbon . would love to try this more often , very hard to find in MN.	4.35
2803	Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottle to mini snifter.. Not much coffee. But plenty of heat on this one. Bourbon BA is unmistakable. Some heat on the back too. Otherwise, a very solid imperial stout with all the typical flavors.	4.52
2804	The Peach	A- Hazy golden body. Two finger creamy cap with good retention. Small sheets of lacing form after each sip.. S- Oh peachy beast. Great whole fruit, flesh and skin and pit peach authenticity. Stone fruit full on and in your face. Some lactic, funk and oak. Not much cognac here. Peaches and sourness are the driving forces.. T- Sour peach saturation. Beautiful ripe peaches with tart and somewhat bitter skin notes. Strong lactic acid sourness. Peach pith and juice bordering on nectar level. Vinous oak with a slight touch of cognac. A bit of Brett funk as time goes on..  801 characters	4.49
2805	The Peach	Looks hazy orange with a white head. Lots of peach and oak in the flavor. Good balance of tart and sweet - loaded with peach. One of the best sour's I've had.	4.6
2806	The Peach	Semi-clear filling to hazy dark orange with a khaki blanket that fizzles out quickly to nothing.. It's pretty wild how drastically de Garde beers vary from one to the next, even within the same The series.. This one's ultra funky and oaky up front, then finishes quite sour. The funk is woody and a little cheesy, like blue with walnut and cashew, as the bright peach accent brings in some pear and overripe sweaty ass fruit under a hot sun. The prickly medium-light body swallows sharply sour and oaky, finishing dry.	4.06
2807	The Peach	Thanks, to either Sam or Brian for this one. September 2018 release, 6.5%. A clear light orange with a dense, white head with good retention and lacing, this looks solid. The nose is quite exciting. The combination of cognac and peaches is inspired and genuinely works. The star of the show, however, are the peaches. Bright, ripe juicy as well as sour, semi-ripe peaches are present, fleshy, pulpy, juicy. A touch of vanilla as well. The palate opens with a bright and explosive peach character but unfortunately carried on a base beer that's pretty intensely sour. Strong lactic acid sourness with preserved lemons and a lemonade are present. A large peach note, a blend of ripe, juicy peaches and semi-raw, mildly tannic ones, are is present up front. Notes of cognac are present on the mid-palate and are mostly hidden by the peach and the lactic notes. Medium-light in body and softly carbonated and drying and sour on the finish with a blend of peach and lactic sourness with a little cognac. I am surprised by how sour this is, it reminds me of a 6 year old Fou'foune instead of a fresh beer. The sourness does hamper the balance and drinkability some. Still, this is quite enjoyable.	3.97
2808	The Peach	Look: super hazy light yellow orange with a light white head. Smell: slight acetic acid, some oak and a lot of peach. Taste: its a tart sweet peach bomb.  244 characters	4.69
2809	The Peach	This one pours with a very clear light orange hue, with a small head and not much lacing.. This smells like funky cognac, sour peach, acidity/vinegar, and a sort of mineral funk.. This is one of the more acidic de Garde beers I've had- it's bracingly sour, with the peaches adding a big additional tartness. The cognac adds a touch of funky sweetness to tone down the acidity a bit, but it doesn't cut it a whole lot. There's a prickly mineral finish a bit too..  627 characters	4.03
2810	The Peach	"Batch 3
The beer pours a Clear gold with a medium white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells tart, peaches, oak, and banana. It tastes tart, with peaches, oak, and light funk. The feel is medium light and dry. A good sour from De Garde, but not one of my favorites from one of my favorite breweries."	4.42
2811	The Peach	11/2015 - Batch 1 - Love when this warms - the cognac pops incredibly, the peach is lovely, and the funk takes a back seat; more peach, cognac, and barnyard on the palate, with some classic dG funk to round it out; pretty great body, with a lightly sweet, a touch acidic finish.	4.85
2812	The Peach	Batch 2, I think.. A: Light golden, very good clarity, a fizzy cap of bright white head with largish bubbles in the head despite tight-looking carbonation. No lacing, mediocre retention.. S: Pretty aromatic—I can smell the beer from my glass two feet away. Ripe peach, tart lemony twang, earth and light horse blanket. A little spice and leather as it opens up..  851 characters	3.94
2813	The Peach	Something has to have been wrong with my bottle. Poured like jelly, little to no peach flavor, no carbonation. An overall strange experience for sure.	3.03
2814	The Peach	Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a sour peach that is very mild and pleasant. Taste is a very nice sour peach.	4.73
2815	The Peach	Batch 2 drank in a snifter on 9/16/2017. A phenomenal beer that I will be thrilled to try again in the future. The tartness was done to perfection, the peach flavor was spectacular, and the barrel came through nicely as well. Really well done beer and another amazing offering from de garde.	4.74
2816	The Peach	A wild ale's wild Ale. De Garde nailed it on this one. Appearance is a hazy opaque golden orange peach color, absolutely beautiful! This was B1 so the nose was in the face cognac from the moment the bottle was capped ... oh them barrels!! Flavor is big peach, with nice integrated Brandy tones, and the mouthfeel is as rich as a wild Ale can get. Home run with B1 de Garde!	5
2817	The Peach	Bottle on-site at de Garde. This one was as advertised and maybe even better. One of the best fruited wild ales I have ever had. Nearly perfect in execution - incredible fruit flavor and just enough sourness. I liked this better than Nectarine Premiere.	4.75
2818	The Peach	Poured from a 22oz bottle into De Garde snifter.. Pours a slightly hazy orange body with a one finger white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave slight lacing, little retention.. Aromas are sour and fruit, lots of peach and lactic tartness, stone fruits, oak and sour warheads..  493 characters	4.71
2819	The Peach	Batch 2, reviewed 6/20/17.. A: Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with just a thin film of bubbles atop. Has an almost caramel color in the glass, very reminiscent of freshly squeezed peach juice. 8/10 on the opacity scale.. S: Punches with funk and peach skin up front. Mushrooms, earth, and a bit of gym locker stank. Meshes very nicely with an assertive peach skin note and a hint of wood. Sweet peach comes out more as it warms, but the blending of the fruit and funk is done damn near perfectly on the nose..  1,282 characters	4.65
2820	The Peach	Pours a bright, sunny yellow color, clouded, with a smaller white head, which disappears soon.. The nose is defined by rubbery funk, mushrooms and lots of young peaches. Funk and fruits collide in a very gentle way, creating an intriguing complexity with peaches being the most prominent ingredient.. Has a sparkly effervescence, together with a mineralic quality, while providing a very refreshing, easy drinking, yet very acidic body..  1,149 characters	3.39
2821	The Peach	"L: pours almost clear, but a cloudy straw yellow with a film of white head
S: big juicy peach and some sourness. Smells of pure peach, no funk.
T: just like the nose...all clean sour peach. Not funk or barnyard, no straw. This is just like fuzzy from side project.
F: oh man, so drinkable. Not puckering, flavors linger, so drinkable."	4.65
2822	The Peach	Had this alongside the Imperial Apricot Bu. This one wasnt nearly as tart when but it got considerably more tart as it warmed. TONS of peach on the nose and palate here though and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Total Peach Bomb!	4.96
2823	The Peach	Appearance: murky and cloudy bright yellow. Aroma: fresh ripe peaches! Very pleasant, eventually smells like the Jolly Ranchers Peach when it warms up. The sourness is there but it's like an afterthought.. Taste: very sour upfront and then the peaches just works its way in. Noticeable at first but as it warms up, it's full blown fresh tart peaches! One sip after another is really like taking a bite out of a peach, but on top of that you add complexity as it's highly sour. I do not notice trace of oak or whatever it was aged in, but that's okay, it's over abundant in peaches..  735 characters	4.97
2824	The Peach	Batch 1 (cognac barrels), poured into a tulip. Juicy peach, just the right amount of barrel/funk. Not overly complex but a delicious beer. Looking forward to comparing with Batch 2.	4.71
2825	The Peach	Shared with a good buddy in Denver. Little 2 man share so boss pours for both of us. The nose was explosive peach and funk... incredible! Taste followed right along... the most expressive peach sour I have ever had, absolutely mind blowing. We both finished our glasses and immediately posted ISO's haha	5
2826	The Peach	"Look: regular look, foamy head
Smell: Straight Peach to the nose
Taste: Strong peach taste with a the classic de garde funk as always, sour peaches
Feel: lots of peach and bubbly funk"	4.87
2827	The Peach	It's been awhile since I had a de Garde beer. Perfect balance of peach and sourness. Color is a nice hazy orange. Thanks to the gang for bringing this to a share.	5
2828	The Peach	Holy mother of peach! This is as smooth as @TheBluejerzzzz and @brians52's illegitimate love child. This peach bomb will pucker your lips and drop you off in flavor town like Guy Ferie	5
2829	Double Shot	"Picked up 2 cases of Treehouse 2 weeks ago. Got 4 of these. Drank one before Trekkies wedding last week. This review is based on that beer.. Crack can, looks black inside, pours black outside. Brown head 3/5"" deep. Looks impressive. Found the aroma to be weaker than expected in terms of the coffee presence. Was pretty mild for something rated world class and a ""double shot"" of a name rated the #1 stout in the world (although its 8.2% abv should prolly have it categorized as a double stout, but then it wouldn't be ""#1"" if they did that).. Taste was fine. Delivered on every commercial tug job aspect the beer talks about, yes there is lots of hearty roasted malt, plenty of chocolate malt notes, even plenty of coffee notes from the roasted malt. But the coffee presence itself, I dunno, I've literally had dozens of better coffee beers, much less coffee stouts. Some dude said these were $8 a can, but I don't recall seeing that when I got mine. Mouthfeel was good, alcohol wasn't problematic. I liked it and will look forward to cracking the other 3 cans of it. I dunno, sometimes my nose isn't working good, but I wasn't tasting it either, perhaps I will revise the aroma upward if that is the case."	3.89
2830	Double Shot	16 oz can poured into a snifter. Pours an opaque, oily black. Aroma and flavor are bitter coffee, dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, and sweet vanilla. Very drinkable despite how sweet and thick it comes across.	4.44
2831	Double Shot	super smooth, creamy, velvet-y, chocolate-milk.... my can says 8.2%, though, as opposed to this site's data and it doesnt even show it. who needs coffee when you have this in the frig waiting? starbucks should stock up on this!	4.75
2832	Double Shot	Picked-up a single can at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for $8.05. My fifty eighth brew from these guys. Very fine beer, pinging a bit due to extremely high cost.	4.25
2833	Double Shot	16oz can poured into a snifter.. A: In color it is as close to black as possible, a very dark brown. Three solid fingers of brown head rise on an aggressive pour. Retention is awesome and lacing is downright chunky. A really good-looking beer.. S: Fudgey and roasty. Brownie batter and malted milk balls. Roasted barley. Smokey, maybe even a whiff of jerky. Bitter espresso. Coffee beans. Subtle red fruit and alcohol..  1,292 characters	3.86
2834	Double Shot	pours out a dark brown - black color, deep brown tinged brown head, sort of fizzy but hangs around for a while.. aromas are mellow earthy coffee roast, slightly bitter, slightly acidic, hinting at fruity quality. mellow chocolate in there as well.. palate is subdued coffee roast, earthy, slightly bitter, fruity notes of blueberry, bittersweet and milk chocolate, sugary roasted nuts, mellow brown sugar, hint of cream. as it warms the bitterness becomes a bit more harsh invoking an espresso like quality, some caramel sweetness presenting as well. the coffee flavors and sweetness become more robust as it warms, bringing a coffee whipped cream flavor, coffee candies, soft caramel, and melted brown sugar..  901 characters	4.6
2835	Double Shot	Pours a dark brown with tan head. It smells of intense coffee. No bitterness at all to this. Just fudgey chocolate and coffee. Smooth as hell. It's very approachable in the way that every Tree House is approachable. This no doubt tastes great and is super smooth, but it is also the type of coffee stout that people who don't drink coffee stouts would like. It's not super complex and has one note of those three flavors.	4.27
2836	Double Shot	"Drank from a 500 ml (1 pt .9 fl. oz) bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a snifter. Outstanding appearance. An inch-tall, super tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the oily, pitch black body. The head slowly dropped to a clingy collar. Large swaths of lacing coated the glass and stuck around until the drink’s end.. The aroma was coffee forward but not to the extent I was anticipating. Darker roast coffee perhaps. Big dark malt notes too. Moderately roasty. There was an interesting savory quality as well. Bakers chocolate also came to mind..  1,308 characters"	4.65
2837	Double Shot	Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is dark roast coffee, chocolate, and light vanilla. Heavy bodied, roasty with moderate carbonation. Solid coffee stout with plenty of coffee flavor. You can tell this is the base for their other sweet stout. Above average. Plenty of coffee taste for coffee drinkers.	3.83
2838	Double Shot	A- 500ml pours into a tulip glass with a tar black body and a deep brown, thick and creamy head. The cap makes it to just over a finger at its peak and has good retention. A few webs of lacing coat the glass.. S- Rich coffee and chocolate with that roasty barley edge to round out the richer aromas. Chocolate cake, medium-dark roast coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla sweets and a touch of caramel.. T- Again the coffee and the chocolate really run the show here with the coffee taking center stage here a bit more compared to the aroma. Really comes on like a medium roast espresso shot that leads into a chocolate chip brownie and fruity very dark chocolate bars. The roast barley and the grains round things out with a base of dark roast barley, toasted nuts, licorice, toffee and caramel. Again that vanilla sweets hint. A touch of fruit with cherry coming to mind..  1,106 characters	4.43
2839	Double Shot	Just lucked out on being in the right place at right time as I was driving from Fl to Me. I honestly didn’t know that TH did stouts as I have only been at the new brewery one time before. I am so glad that I got this one. My fav beers are RIP’s, stouts and the dark styles and TH really hit a home run with this for me . This is OMG good. A wonderful blend of things that all work together beautifully. I only bought two bottles and now wish I had bought more as I am sipping it for the first time. Just had the second bottle, 8/31/19 and I liked even more than the first bottle. Had to kick my wife and dog out of a fully packed car to buy more. Just didn’t have a good feel to leaving my wife and dog at Tree House. Bummer.	4.46
2840	Double Shot	"Traded for this and a few other bottles from Tree House this week, as I never had anything dark and heavy from them before. Although the Vanilla Bean take on this was better, this was a solid beer that felt like sensual coffee in a bottle. If you like your beer to be roasted, slick, and complemented by appropriate flavors, then you've found your match right here!. Of course, this poured quite dark like coffee with plenty of bubbly, tan head to top it off. That took a while to settle as there was plenty of clingy, sudsy lacing left behind from the moment I took the first sip of this. Fresh-roasted coffee, vanilla bean and extract, rich chocolate, and tangy blood orange filled the subtle nose as white chocolate sweetness, espresso bean, and soft cream came in to take this beer to the next level. Like it's other iteration, this came across as an ""Imperial Breakfast Stout"", if one were to actually exist. Roasted Malt somehow emerged through all of these flavors and enhanced this beer, as it gave it depth without making it feel dry or typecast in the process.... Amazingly, the booze in this was present enough to be felt but understated enough to let the other flavors take hold, from the get-go on out. A tiny presence of plum and dark fruit took hold before I finished this off as the acidity from that and the blood orange presence was enough to elevate this from the chocolate-coffee--vanilla threshold that holds so many beers of this type back. Like their more famous IPA's, this was a beer from Tree House that's worth seeking out or trading for - can't recommend anything in this series highly enough!"	4.43
2841	Double Shot	Very pretty pour: thick, black, and fizzy, with a retentive chocolate brown head.. Smells like chocolate vanilla cake, but somehow without any ersatz or cloying nodes. Lots of brewers have recently resorted to gimmickery to make their beers taste like pastries--pouring frosting and moon pies into the mash, etc. This is old fashioned coffee stout sweetness, and it's done to a motherfucking t.. Tastes very nearly as good as it smells. Chocolate and vanilla up front, moving into more of a traditional dry coffee stout in the middle with bittersour barley balancing out the sweeter flavors, and the finish is a wonderful combination of mocha, vanilla, and barley..  882 characters	4.81
2842	Double Shot	absolutely fantastic, everything I hoped it would be! Looks like a perfect (Double) shot of espresso, with a dark caramel colored head. Wonderful coffee aroma which comes though perfectly without any boozieness that a lot of stouts tend to carry.	5
2843	Double Shot	"Pours black with two fingers mocha head that lasted for a bit.
Smells of cocoa, roasty malts, coffee, vanilla.
Taste is chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roasty malt.
Full body, creamy, smooth.
Overall an excellent coffee stout!"	4.47
2844	Double Shot	Pours black with two fingers of dense, caramel-colored foam. Head retention is good with good lacing left behind. Aroma is cocoa powder, toffee and dark chocolate with very faint medium-roast coffee. Malts are roasty and toasty and provide a fairly robust base. Flavor profile is cocoa powder, toffee, dark and milk chocolate, and medium-roast coffee. Malts hit notes of roasty, toasty, caramely, and bready. Sugary notes of milk and dark chocolate linger with balanced medium-roast coffee, and lightly bitter roasted malts for a lengthy period of time between sips. Flavor profile really exudes decadence, while the aroma is a little bit dry and forgettable in comparison. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, decadent texture. Overall, an intriguing beer with the aroma being faint and the flavor profile being stout and resolute.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 500mL bottle.	4.37
2845	Double Shot	First beer of 2019, dry January is OVER!. Bottle poured into a snifter. Black motor oil, solid one finger brown foam layer, some lacings.  271 characters	4.68
2846	Double Shot	Tasted from bottle. Pours black with thick beige head. Nice roasted coffee aroma. Flavors of vanilla, cocoa, creamy with tons of coffee. Some caramel notes as well. Awesome beer.	4.74
2847	Double Shot	500ml undated bottle.. Pours opaque black with a minimal head, zero retention and a few minor streaks of lacing. Bakers chocolate drizzled with espresso in the nose. Full bodied with a creamy, slick, oily mouthfeel. Brownie batter with espresso on the palate. Rich, chocolaty and coffee-laden. Finishes fairly dry but quite rich.	4.4
2848	Double Shot	"Purchased fresh at the brewery on 1/10/19. Poured semi-vigorously into a Tree House Teku glass with a white logo. The white glowed against the midnight dark brown beer as if it were from Three Mile Island (the nuclear power plant, not the AMC summer camp). The current description suggests the Double Shot has been a project that has evolved. (from the website: These bottles represent the culmination of a coffee beer project nearly four years in the making. Double Shot, our beloved coffee stout, has been refined time and time again to achieve a beer that is both as robust in its base as it is a worthy purveyor of its respective coffee.""). It makes me wonder if a new, separate, entry should be made into Beer Advocate for this ""vintage"" of Double Shot (even though they list it as ""original""). That said.... L: Spot on perfect. A vigorous pour created a thick, creamy head that was a dark tan/dark camel color..  3,151 characters"	4.06
2849	Double Shot	"Bottled date unknow. Bought @Tree house on 1/4. Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 1/5.
Dark Black.brown colour. NIce coffee aroma.
Sweetness was slightly too strong for me. But coffee and cacao notes were great."	4.08
2850	Double Shot	03/2014 - Huge coffee, vanilla, big malts up front; bitter yet roasty flavors dominate the palate, with caramel, milk chocolate, and some dark fruit in the back; fairly solid body, with coffee and light vanilla lingering.	4.45
2851	Double Shot	Pours a pitch black color with a dark brown head, slowly fading down to a thicker ring of lacing.. Smells of oily seeweed and soy sauce enriched coffee with a huge impact of spicy molasses and modest earth. Has a layer of rich dark chocolate to it, together with some caramel and dried wild berries.. Has a smooth and soft mouthfeel with a well developed, sparkly carbonation, resulting in a smooth, lighter bodied beer..  888 characters	4.02
2852	Double Shot	Double Shot Christmas 2017 vintage. I sat on this one for a few months, which is kind of a stupid thing - further evidence that my cellar is tremendously out of control.. Drank side by side with Impermanence, which was a bit of a surprising experience in several ways. My expectations were quite high for Double Shot - though Impermanence ended up being the true star of the show.. Double Shot features quite a lot of coffee, obviously - the nose and taste are a slurry of rich, smooth, creamy coffee and chocolate. It's very clean, though it is a bit thin. The nose is likely my favorite element of the beer..  938 characters	4.33
2853	Double Shot	The pour is incredible, very thick and it just started smelling like coffee as soon as I opened the bottle. The taste is really good but it looks creamier and silkier than it actually feels in the mouth. Solid all around.	4.58
2854	Grey Monday	750 ml bottle at share, courtesy of Toby. Pours out the normal, but nice retention on the head gives it a better look. Aroma is nutty, but a bit too much like flavoring and not real nuts. Still good. Lots of vanilla, chocolate, roasty notes on top of a velvety feel. Really superb, and aged well.	4.36
2855	Grey Monday	No head retention. Fairly clear and pale, more like a strong ale than stout.. Nose is almost all booze and brown sugar. No hint of hazelnuts.. Brew is nutty on the palate, especially up front, followed by waves of brown sugar, grapes, dates, chocolate, oak, raisins, bourbon, and lots of boozy heat..  558 characters	4.35
2856	Grey Monday	Good lord is this a boozy beast.. I decided, probably in error, to drink a bottle by myself on a Tuesday evening. I had two Grey Mondays gathering dust in my cellar - and no one ever wants to open these at shares, so I thought I might start thinning the herd. Full disclosure: I only finished one glass before falling asleep.. Appearance brings to mind a barleywine, more than a stout - Grey Monday pours a deep reddish brown and smells tremendously boozy. Seriously, this stuff makes my head swim. Hazelnuts are faint in the nose, but there's definitely a bit of warm nuttiness there. It's quite sweet and fairly sticky, thick, and oily..  812 characters	4.47
2857	Grey Monday	2016 bottle. Pours black with beige head. Huge caramel, hazelnut and cocoa aroma. Taste is still a little boozy but good for its ridiculously high ABV. Lots of hazelnut on the flavor with molasses, caramel, butterscotch, cocoa, bourbon. Delicious huge beer. Definitely a sipper.	4.64
2858	Grey Monday	Bottled 9/24/13; drank 8/8/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Muddy brown/purple appearance.. Minimal dark tan head; no lace..  390 characters	4.75
2859	Grey Monday	"L: pours clear brown without a head but is thin and black in the glass
S: bourbon, hazelnuts, chocolate...big sweetness. Smells delicious
T: yum, just like the nose it has the bourbon and chocolate hazelnuts all working together. This vintage is 20.0% and it is smooth. Never would guess it. But it soo sweet, only a few oz in a sitting is drinkable.
F: a bit thin like the pour suggested but sticky sweet.
O: great beer but only can drink it on small quantities"	4.27
2860	Grey Monday	2017 Release. 20.0% ABV.. The pour is a dark brown with a distinct crimson hue. Hardly any head appears, but what does bubble up is a nice ivory color. Thin and spaced out, quick to disappear.. As was expected, this thing is BOOZY, with lots of dark fruit right away on the nose. As it warms, bourbon and oak come forth with some urgency. The booze is still overwhelming, but the subtly complex aromas that come peeking through that ethanol are pleasant, and chocolate in particular becomes gradually more prevalent..  1,187 characters	3.93
2861	Grey Monday	Grey Monday '14 on 181225. Pours an oily almost black color with no head at all.. Smells of honey, scorched malts, spicy molasses, toasty oak and a faint hint of heated hazelnuts..  677 characters	3.45
2862	Grey Monday	An aroma of booze and hazelnut. A bit of heat in the taste but with this high ABV how could there not be? I like the mild carbonation. This is creamy goodness. I even loved the aroma they put in the wax!	4.62
2863	Grey Monday	2017 vintage. Pours a deep mahogany with a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals hazelnut, cocoa, butterscotch and spirit/ethanol. Taste expresses butterscotch, cocoa, ethanol and a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a lively carbonation. All and all - drinkable and ABV is dangerously well-hidden; however, I think another year in the cellar might be the sweetspot.	4.1
2864	Grey Monday	Pouring from a 2016 750 ml. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out very light in color for the style, just like the rest of the series. Doesn't form a crown, only an outer ring of bubbles attaching themselves to the glass. The smell is big boozy raisins and plums with slight chocolate as well. This whole series has had huge dark fruit notes. It just smells like you're going to get drunk. The taste comes in hot with booze and the dark fruit remains. This is the version aged on hazelnuts, but honestly how would you ever know with a beer this boozy? I do think I like this one better than the rest, but they just still don't hold up to the caliber I thought they would bring.	4.21
2865	Grey Monday	03/2014 - There's certainly ethanol up front, with bourbon, Nutella, and some anise; decent mouthfeel that lasts with cocoa, plum, tobacco; subtle heat and booze, creamy and sweet finish.	4.43
2866	Grey Monday	Poured from the bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. Vintage 2018.. Dark oily chestnut brown out of the bottle, filling with a deep mahogany brown body color. Snapping tan head, making two fingers but dissolves very quickly off the pour, with virtually no collar.. Exquisite aroma. Even while opening and pouring the beer just bursts alive. Thick rich nougat smelling, with hints of earthy walnuts/hazelnut smelling quality. Deep dark cocoa and rich almost coffee scented chocolate bar quality. Wine port like aromas particularly with woody barrel notes all over of oak, even a strange touch of soft cinnamon character without the burn. Big, impressive, controlled, not ovepowering but just giant and salivating. Woah..  1,496 characters	4.51
2867	Grey Monday	Vintage 2013! I had a 2015 after 1 year of aging. This is better, but is mostly booze and sugar at this point. A bit too drinkable for 18+%. Prost!	4.29
2868	Grey Monday	Really impressed, but not as nutty as I expected. Dark and opaque with small tan head. Rich nose with heat in the nose, bourbon, reasons and sweet malt. The taste is very complex with molasses, Brown sugar, dates, raisins, oak,bourbon and just a hint of nuts.	4.71
2869	Grey Monday	Bottle: 2013. A: Pour is thick, and dark brown with minimal head formation, retention, and lacing. S: Hazelnuts, dark figs and mixed fruits in the aroma. Quite impressive with the barrel character surfacing the roasted malts, nuts, and fruity/earthy undertones. A nice balance to the subtle foray of black licorice, toffee, molasses, smoked bourbon, vanilla, toasted coconut/marshmallows.  800 characters	4.25
2870	Grey Monday	"Look: Mahogany brown with small white head. Has low carbonation.
Smell: Hazelnuts, Almond, chocolate, with bourbon heat.
Taste: Hazelnuts, marshmallows, Almond, chocolate, with bourbon heat.
Mouthfeel: Medium full.
Overall: A good bourbon barrel aged stout from the Bruery."	4.41
2871	Grey Monday	"Reviewed on 12/25/17
2017 bottle
L - pours a dark caramel color with a minuscule fizzy mocha head.
S - Upon opening the bottle and got a big blast of sugary hazelnuts. But in the glass, the beer smells like Black Tuesday.
T - There is classic Black Tuesday sweetness and a little bitter boozy notes. Finish is a little nutty.
F - The mouth feel is a little thin but sticky. Finish is dry and a little astringent. Definitely has chest heat.
O - I don't think this is much better than Black Tuesday. The hazelnuts are a unique variation. But I don't think there is as much depth."	4.63
2872	Grey Monday	2017 bottle. L - teku pour. Thin out if the bottle. Dark cola brown in the teku. Nice bubbly offwhite one finger head. Thick sticky lacyling.. S - literally made me cackle with mind blowing sensory overload. Like the decadent black tuesday with sweet nutty Nutella and vanilla whipped throughout. Fuck..  760 characters	4.52
2873	Grey Monday	In the interest of fairness, I am not a huge fan of hazelnut. There is something of putting about the overall profile. That said, at the front the thick boozing this is very apparent. Lingering about the mouth, the hazelnut was very easy to detect. The field was very sticky and sweet, swinging easily to the sides of the mouth. The feel was almost chewy. Raisins and dark fruit were also present. Yet in the overall scheme of things, the hazelnut make this hard for me to like.	4.08
2874	Grey Monday	To me this tastes like a slightly smoother more chocolatey black tuesday. And I love black tuesday dont get me wrong but I dont think this one is worth the extra effort of chasing down compared to black tuesday. the wax smells amazing tho	4.54
2875	Grey Monday	750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/4/2016. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger foamy khaki head with poor retention, and reduces to nothing pretty quickly. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Plenty of alcohol legs on the glass. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roasted bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairy full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/syrupy/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a small lingering warmth, with mild booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. I was hoping for more intense hazelnut character from this; but it seems to be much more balanced between the malt, barrel, and hazelnut flavors. A highly enjoyable offering regardless.	4.3
2876	Grey Monday	Reviewing a 2016 version. The beer pours a strange deep brown color with no head and no lacing.. The smell explodes with chocolate, bourbon, and nutty dark fruits.. The taste is sweet, nutty, chocolate, boozy, and bourbon..  355 characters	4.5
2877	Grey Monday	L: black with no real head or lacing.. S: nice bourbon smell. Maybe a slight slight hazelnut. There is a nutty smell on the back. Mostly Black Tuesday.. T: decadent beer. Smooth bourbon with the base beer present. A little more depth than Black Tuesday..  482 characters	4.34
2878	Grey Monday	Sanded, not yet polished dark brown wood with a minimal tan fizzy ring.. This puppy is hot as hell, but what else did I expect? It also has a sweet syrupy flavor with honey. It's almost barleywine-esque, which is surprising for its relative youth (2016), and has a slick feel with tons of bourbon. There's minimal hazelnut, if any at all--which is a damn shame and a huge waste of hazelnuts.	2.56
2879	Great	"Look: Amber, translucent
Smell: Caramel, dark fruits, some bourbon
Taste: Similar to the smell. Caramel and dark fruit dominate. The barrel is there but doesn't take over
Feel: A touch thin, but the carb level is absolutely perfect. Super smooth
Overall: One of my favorite barleywines to date. Really drinkable. Has a great sweetness to it, but still lets the caramel and dark fruits shine."	4.61
2880	Great	Hazy bronze with a frothy, bubbly light khaki head, Great delivers smoky caramel and toffee with nutty marzipan, splintery oak, and pungent aged orange zest on top of an underlying toasted biscuit, all via a crisp bubbliness and a light but solid heat that rides along some peppery whiskey.	4.08
2881	Great	I was extremely impressed with this beer. Had it on tap at Alpine and then the Alpine pub in 2018. Malty, little to no hops, great barrel character, and smooth finish. Can't wait to try my bottle!	4.8
2882	Great	12/2017 - 2015 vintage - From what I heard, the 2013 vintage is way better than this; that said, this was good - solid bourbon, toffee, caramel, and some vanilla; thinner body than I'd expect from a barleywine.	4.29
2883	Great	Taster at BW share. Medium, murky amber, kind of flat. Aroma is strong and malty, kind of medicinal. Taste smooths out Abit sweet and dusty. A bit of dryness and some booze.	3.5
2884	Great	16.9oz bottle into a tulip. Thanks Ryan for sharing.. Muddy brown body, small head. On the nose is Candied sugar, molasses, dark fruit. On the tongue this is super complex and flavorful. Liquid candy - dark sugar, sweet caramel bark, syrupy molasses, toffee, a touch of aged hops, light bitter aftertaste. Rich body and mouthfeel.. One of the best if not the best barleywine I've ever had. So complex and flavorful.	4.66
2885	Great	Brown and dark amber pour, ultra thin lighter brown head. Aroma knocks substantial whiskey and brown malt notes all over it. Its boozy. But it blends well with the rest of the brown malt, brown sugar, maris otter and said booziness.. Taste is a sipping experience. Nuts, caramel and toffee all over it. A hint of raisin. I wouldn't say this hid the alcohol, that is pretty much impossible at this abv. But it does what it can. On the back end of the mouthfeel you can pull mild black and tan tobacco notes. Also has a substantial amount of viscosity for a barleywine. It also is on the high end of the spectrum when it comes to stickiness as well. A touch of earth to round it out. While its a very enjoyable beer, I dunno, would just as much if not more prefer something a little easier going like CW or BCS barleywine. This one might be just a tad too big for my ideal tastes.	4.13
2886	Great	Batch 1 bottle poured in a stemmed bulb. Pours a murky brown color. Minimal head that fades quick. Aromas of dates, raisins, plums, caramel and toffee. Taste is exactly as the aroma. Sweet dark fruits, caramel and toffee just coat the mouth. This is like drinking candy. Absolutely amazing. No booze. Feel is full bodied for the style. Overall, this is an amazing beer. Best barleywine I’ve had to date!	4.92
2887	Great	"2012 or 2013 vintage....12oz bottle. L: pours light brown color, syrup look with no head on the pour.
S: typical bourbon soaked caramel covered raisins. Great aroma, it's not a huge aroma, but nice for sure
T: nice barrel on this one and equally as good caramel covered raisins.
F: so smooth, thick and coating"	4.69
2888	Great	Fabulous Barleywine. The bourbon is really pronounced and at the same time incredibly smooth. Big bourbon on the nose, with hints of molasses caramel and nuts on the palate. Mouthfeel is rich. Must have if you're a Barleywine person.	4.56
2889	Great	2015 vintage drank on 7/8/2017. Look was syrupy with decent lacing and very little head. Smell and taste were in point. Nice caramel, toffee, barrel, raisin and a little plum. Pretty creamy for a bw. Overall a pleasure to drink. One of the best in this style and glad I finally got to try this.	4.46
2890	Great	Deep amber with a surprisingly thick, white head. Smells like coconut, caramel, oak, a hint of tobacco and a not so subtle hint of whiskey. Tastes is sweet, like raisin sweet, but not at all cloying; like a fine sherry. Thick and sticky, but easy to drink. One of the best.	4.75
2891	Great	Yields a clean hazelnut brown to ember color with a small, light brown head.. Smells of spicy Bourbon with a hint of coconut among scented wood, wrapped up by dried, sugared wild berries. Very intriguing as for its focussed complexity, sweet and decadent, reminiscent to the complexity of a port wine, also as for its prominent fruit quality on the nose. Offers molasses, glazed caramel and a healthy amount of rock sugars.. Has a medium bodied mouthfeel, slick and oily, malty and sweet, with a balancing Bourbon dryness, revealing a satisfying warmth..  1,404 characters	4.35
2892	Great	It's grrrrrrrrrrrrreat! Seriously, very tasty, and well worth trying. I won't go into crazy details because you've read enough of those, but I will point out the interesting finish that hints toward a maple taste.	4.74
2893	Great	On tap at NC Rare 1/28/17. Caramel color. Smell was caramel, dark fruit, malts. Tasted more like an English barleywine. No hops at all. Mostly caramel, dates, raisin, mild barrel. Overall, this was a fantastic beer. The barrel was not overdone like a lot of BA barleywines.	4.6
2894	Great	Big, thick, and dark (there's a joke in there somewhere) are the only ways to describe this epic barleywine from Alpine! While overall I found it to be a touch too sweet, it's still a fantastic BA version of the style.	4.42
2895	Great	Had 2013 Great. This is the best barley wine I have ever had. So thick and tasty, with great caramel taste. Great heavy thick smell. This barley wine changed how I felt about barley wines.	5
2896	Great	"L: Auburn, dark brown hues with a minimal light sandy head
S: Cloves, raisins, and all spice
T: Honestly this tastes so smooth - like the best oatmeal raisin cookie you've ever had soaked in some Pappy or Eagle Rare - wow, beautiful taste profile
F: Medium and chewy
O: To be frank I categorically tend to avoid barleywines, but this beer backs up the 'Great' claim and then some. Awesome beer and great digestif. Well done."	4.54
2897	Great	"This is truly a ""great"" experience. I would not classify this as an American Barleywine, but an English one. I've never had the base, but the barrel transforms this into such a smooth and sweet tasting masterpiece. The alcohol is also masterfully hidden. There are no hoppy notes at all."	4.93
2898	Great	"Type: 8-oz. draft
Glass: Clear snifter glass
From: Alpine Beer Company pub in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $7.00
Purchased: Dec. 30, 2015
Consumed: Dec. 30, 2015
Misc.: 2015 release. Poured an auburn, murky color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki tan, foamy head when I got it. Burst of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Below average wet lacing on the sides. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.75). Smelled toffee, caramel, dates, leathery tobacco, light Jack Daniels whiskey, light butterscotch, dark peach and light citra rind. (Smell - 4.00).  975 characters"	4.44
2899	Great	Poured from a bottle. 2015 vintage, day after release.. Smells like caramel apples and english toffee. Smooth! Amazingly smooth. Frosting. Melted caramel frosting. The flavors are not overly sweet and overly woodsy, but definitely there. Perfectly layered like a ganache. This is a sipper, and well worth the wait to try.	4.86
2900	Great	"On tap at Alpine 12-22-2015 on release day.
Not a big fan of Barelywines I like them but would always prefer a stout or IPA, that being said ""Great"" and ""A Deal With The Devil"" are the only ones I would hunt.
Great is amazing this year around they found a way to improve a already great barleywine.
bourbon followed by notes of caramel, toffee, raisins and sweet fruit that are velvety smooth and silky.
the nose is just as amazing as the taste."	4.92
2901	Great	"On tap at Alpine 12/22/2015
An outstanding barleywine. This is a big improvement on good which I have always felt was overly sweet. With great, the sweetness is definitely toned down with the barrel aging. The mixture of caramel, raising, and apricot preserve is very well done. Some bourbon upfront with oak on the back end. This is a very rich barleywine that has a very bold, yet smooth flavor profile. I only wish it had the luscious dark red copper color that the mostra great had, which was also on tap. Other than that, it's hard to find anything I dislike about this beer. Very well done alpine!"	4.82
2902	Great	Amazing Barleywine. One of the best beers I've had. Pours a tad flat, but expected for the style and from other reviews.. Hard to describe how GREAT this is. It is the perfect level of sweetness without being too sweet. Light bodied and extremely smooth. The barrel is subdued and works perfectly to balance the sweetness.	4.8
2903	Great	Low carbonation affects the appearance and mouthfeel, but this beer smells and tastes absolutely amazing. Big sticky toffee, caramel, bourbon, dates.....etc. Worth seeking out. Up there with the best for sure.	4.63
2904	In Perpetuity	appearance is pretty standard tree house haze with good carbonation. Aroma is citrus, and some dank ness. The taste is some orange, citrus zest, earthy hops, and a little Dankness rounding it out. Mouthfeel is also amazing, as per usual tree house. Creamy, slick, medium, but also a little light. Not thin, just very easy drinking with adequate carbonation. Overall this is very good, I’m in the 4.25 range	4.27
2905	In Perpetuity	16oz. can into Night Shift stemware. Shared with schen9303.. Nose is citrus, honey and cane sugar. Almost zesty. Solid if simple and a touch muted. Beer opens accented clementine and orange. Starfruit, cane sugar and some pineapple in the middle and end. Simple but delicious. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Prickly on the palate and bright and accented going down. Clean aftertaste. Super drinkable.. I don't know if this beer is perfect but it's certainly very well made. Awsome representation of the style.	4.17
2906	In Perpetuity	Truly amazing IPA. Citrus nose, good hops, but not too bitter. to be more specific, tastes of grapefruit, tropical fruits and the smell is really divine..	4.66
2907	In Perpetuity	16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Cloudy golden body, standard pulpy Tree House haze, one and half finger white head, good retention, plenty of frothy lacing. Smell is dank citrus, a bit of herbal and floral aromatics, touch of sugary sweetness and caramel, Zest. Flavour follows, good balance of juicy citrus and tropical fruit, herbal spice, slight caramel. Smooth. Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with nice carbonation, mild herbal spice on the backend. Solid IPA, nice tropical fruit bite and the standard creamy Tree House body and carobnation.	4.28
2908	In Perpetuity	"Canned on 9/17. Poured to Glass on 9/22.
A:Hazy Yellow and nice size of clouds.
S: Citrus aroma with peach.
T: Not sticky rather a little dry ? side. Sweetness is not strong.
M:Clean bitterside notes and medium Carbo.
O: Fruitness does not insist strongly. Balance is unique between Hops and malts.
20Min. later, mouthfeel getting mild and more smoother. Much better than immediately after the open.
ABV:6.7% Citra, Nelson American IPA"	4.44
2909	In Perpetuity	"Look (4.0): opaque yellow, not much of a head. some bubbles
Smell (4.25): nice floral, grapey, and hoppy
Taste (4.25): not overly intense. can taste graoes, floral, nice hops without being bitter
Feel (4.25): medium/light. very smooth for 6.7%. little bit of fizz
Overall - 4.25"	4.24
2910	In Perpetuity	Beautiful hazy dark orange, with a creamy white head, tiny dotted lacing. The nose is full of hop, orange and funk, pungent pith and peach. Flavor is softer, opening bright and closing gentle. Superb.	4.6
2911	In Perpetuity	Cloudy, vibrant light orange with a finger-and-a-half of yellowed head. Lasts a good while and leaves rings of lacing.. Strong clementine-like citrus with some cream and floral passionfruit in the nose.. Orange and white wine up front in the taste, followed by a bitter, slightly nutty, slightly grassy finish..  423 characters	4.1
2912	In Perpetuity	Hazy with nice lacing. Taste is floral with great citrus notes. I continue to be impressed by this brewery. I once tried to visit in the Dead of winter and just couldn't bring myself to stand in line all the way around an acre lot. My mistake. These guys rock. A+	4.66
2913	In Perpetuity	Nothing but solid goodness from Tree House. Citrus and tropical flavors are in balance. Nice hazy pour. Not very complex; just straight down the middle solid and enjoyable.	4.02
2914	In Perpetuity	Pours cloudy, bright gold with a dense white head with great spotty lacing. Aroma has nice orange blossom notes, so sweet and floral. Taste has a more pungent punch to it up front, a bit hot with stone fruit tang that settles i to a pleasant, more mellow citrus in the mid taste and finish. Feel is very soft but peppery and hot, especially in the aftertaste. This is just fantastic. Rich and tangy but with a solid backbone of citrus mellowness that keeps it balanced.	4.44
2915	In Perpetuity	L - 3-finger dense, bright white head atop a milky yellow body.. S - strong grapefruit, pineapple, orange.. T - lots of pineapple and grapefruit. Clean middle. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness..  286 characters	4.33
2916	In Perpetuity	16oz can dated 3/7/19.. Pours cloudy yellow with an inch of white fluff. Nice retention and plenty of tattered lacework. Peach, pineapple, and grapefruit in the nose. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Pithy citrus with zero malt and a minimal bitterness on the palate. Unripe peach with grapefruit. Finishes very dry and a bit chalky.. Tasty stuff but I wouldn't wait in line for it.	4.3
2917	In Perpetuity	Tall can, fresh from the source...3/7/19... Great look here, all hazed up, classic NEIPA/TH. A load of fine bubble lacing all over the glass.. Delicate orange/tangerine sniff..  281 characters	4.52
2918	In Perpetuity	16oz can. Pours a hazy, dirty pale yellow with an inch of bubbly head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is sweet citrus and maybe some light floral hops. Orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit and some white wine as well. The taste is mostly the white wine along with some lemon and lime notes. A bit floral and herbal towards the end with some bitter citrus peel. Medium body with lots of carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.	4.05
2919	In Perpetuity	First, I was struck by the lack of head on the beer. Then, it was lighter than some of the other beers, but the after-taste had a certain bitterness.	3.4
2920	In Perpetuity	"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 9/8/17 with ""HOLD ON TO"" written above it and sunshine written below it. Loved the name and label of this beer, down to the ""9/20/14"" on the side which was probably the marriage date referenced in the description. This was a typical beer from Tree House and a typical New England IPA in the sense that was cloudy, juicy, and soft but the latter made this so easy to enjoy as the Citra and Nelson were easy to discern as they worked so harmoniously together.. This had a good pour to it as the liquid looked like faded orange juice, with just a bit more head present here! It held it's own and the lacing on the side of my pint glass was quiet extensive as well as the rings were well-defined and nearly bled down to the ones below them. Tons of orange juice, tangerine, cream, sherbert, and muted earthy dankness in the nose as the citrus slickness came through more boldly in the taste. Melon, white grape, and a bit of woodsy dankness could be felt in the taste as this almost felt barrel-aged but was just a result of the Nelson coming through. The malt was present as this had body but it was tough to pick out any of it besides a basic doughy presence and the carbonation was sufficient enough to keep this from feeling too heavy.. Not a lot of alcohol here but what was present could be felt when I finished this off and lend itself to a slight warming feeling that took hold of me before I polished this off. Just as smooth as the Julius or Haze, this was on par with those while having a bit more depth and earth dankness to it. Love the idea of this and would love to get my hands on a more recent version of it just to see if it's the same take this time around. Long live this beer, in perpetuity!"	4.19
2921	In Perpetuity	Really hazy yellow color with off-white head. Aroma has pineapple and white grapes. Taste is yeasty with some dough bitterness and citrus rind on the finish. Medium body and carbonation. Yeasty with a leafy hop bitterness. Not as good as expected.	4.25
2922	In Perpetuity	"Can dated 1/18/19. Poured into Belgian tulip.
Look is medium hazy bright orange with a white head. Nose is Nelson white grape and tropical fruit with some nice citrus. Taste follows the same with a nice touch of bitterness cutting the other stuff of softly, some lingering fruit but not much aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-light and fluffy but mouth coating. Overall super drinkable beer. Not crazy complex but great presentation of Nelson and citra. Very tasty."	4.52
2923	In Perpetuity	16 oz. can. Hazy orange body with a huge head. Smells of citrus zest and white grape juice. Maybe a little melon. Tastes of citrus zest that tingles the palate. Fruity grape and melon behind it. A touch of pale malt, but not sweet. Dries out in the back end leaving a bit of citrus bitterness. Medium body. I can see myself drinking this very quickly. Really nice.	4.2
2924	In Perpetuity	Cloudy, providing a whitish light gold color. Lasting moderate to large head which provides for several rings of lace and random spots in between.. I get honey and maple syrup initially on the smell. There's a secondary floral hop aroma which has a touch of citrus rind to it.. Like many beers from Tree House, this has a refreshing body (read: thin) with a faint malt presence. The hop dominates with a straight up regular bitterness that reminds me of white pepper. The carbonation is also elevated. The finish culminates with a biting bitterness that lasts a long time after the swallow. Hop heads will rejoice.	4.05
2925	In Perpetuity	Appearance - The beer poured a hazy straw yellow with a white head.. Nose - The nose was bright with lemon that turns bitterly grassy with hops in back.. Taste - At the front, I detected thick bitter lemon with a bitter spiciness that follows. The sweetness of honey with a hint of melon and definite mango followed. Beginning so sweet, the beer ended quite bitterly..  534 characters	4.45
2926	In Perpetuity	"Might be my favorite of the Treehouse beers I got to try. Had this at a University of Nevada football game. Pours a yellow color with some hop haze going through it, 1/2"" white head. Smell those Citra hops, they're in no small quantity here. But even that amount of Citra can't compete with the imperial dank march of the Nelson hop. And for comparison, I just reviewed Nelson the Greeter from Port, and this blows the doors off that beer. And I'm a guy born in San Diego, the anti-homer. Just crushes you with all kinds of tangerine, papaya and marijuana dankness all over this beer.. Taste is pretty dope too. All that citrus and tropical fruit flavor over a body that is supportive, but offers no clashing flavors. Body isn't all smoothed out like a hazy, its soft, but still has an almost hybrid like malt presence between NE and West Coast. Has a bitterness level probably around 45 ibu. Carbonation appropriate. This hit the spot. While all Treehouse I've had has been very good, its been slightly (Abstraction aside) below what everyone else thinks. This one made me believe the hype."	4.37
2927	In Perpetuity	Canned on 12/4/18; consumed on 12/6/18 - making this one about 55-60 hours old.. A: Poured into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a small whitish head, which leaves behind some rings of lace.. S: Really nice nose jumps out of the glass: orange-pineapple juice with a touch of earthy spice..  980 characters	4.74
2928	In Perpetuity	Excellent IPA full of hop juiciness. Citra stand out enhanced with a very slight dryness/tartness likely from the drier Nelson. Subtle malt notes adding some biscuit and thread of caramel. Poured a beautiful merangue like head; stiff with soft peaks with great lacing. Pale soft slightly hazy orange. So remarkably smooth going down. Gentle and foamy on the tongue. A rather unique interesting IPA with its many subtle integrated complexities in an otherwise big Hop juicy brew. Would love try this one again...and again. Outstanding.	4.63
2929	Bomb!	"On tap at The Beer Hog, Pelham AL.
Dark, viscous, motor oil pour. Cold, so not too much head that rises up. What does settle around the glass is ivory in color.. Chocolate-covered coffee beans and vanilla on the nose. Not getting any hints of chili, but you don’t need it. The inviting aromas on this are great on their own.. More of the same in the flavors; milk chocolate, light roast coffee, and sweet vanilla. Again, the flavors don’t really add anything to the flavor profile, but there is a touch of heat on the back end that lingers nicely..  665 characters"	4.47
2930	Bomb!	L: rued oil black with a short brown head, which is appealing if you love stouts.. S: Dark chocolate and cofee, with a hint of spice.. T: chocolate upfront with heavy coffee notes and a light spice finish.  415 characters	4.89
2931	Bomb!	From a 12oz bottle. Jet black color with a half finger of brown head. Boozy malts and cherry smell. Medium feel. Big roasted malt/bitter chocolate/vanilla flavor with a noticeable alcohol/chili pepper burn. A very complex beer that makes an interesting treat.	4.37
2932	Bomb!	look: no head AT ALL. could have mistaken it for coca-cola. actually pouring it into the bottle, it looks like syrup.. Smell: wet chocolate milk. the bowl of cocoa pebbles after you've eaten all the cereal. menthol cigarettes. baking chocolate.. Taste: bitter chocolate, herbs, anise. tastes like one of those weird german liqueurs with 131 herbs; malort, jaeger, chartreuse. as it warms, now i pick up the chili peppers, roasted, at the back of my throat. even stronger milk chocolate. bread. if rye bread were actually chocolate bread. don't get the vanilla..  646 characters	4.3
2933	Bomb!	Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Color is a deep reflective jet black, with a slow-rising then descending thin mahogany head that dissipates. Good lacing, but not retention.. Very pungent and pleasant smell. Espresso, roasted dark chocolate/cocoa, peppers, and roasted malt are upfront on the palette. Other notes of vanilla, smoke/char, licorice, marshmallows, and brown sugar.. Roasted dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, and vanilla are the most dominate flavors. In the background, the chili peppers play an interesting subtle role in adding some assertive personality. The rest of the notes in the aroma are present in a minor sense, but give a nice malty contrast to the strong notes on the palette. The hops leave a nice smokey and bitter aftertaste with notable alcohol. Medium-bodied.	4.59
2934	Bomb!	Been a while since I had one of these.. Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Very dark brown color with very thin brown head but good lacing. Pleasantly pungent coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla smell and taste. Flavors of licorice and dark bread. Hint of smoked chili’s. Goes great with cheese and crackers.	4.31
2935	Bomb!	Very dark, opaque, seems almost viscous while pouring. Initially no head, then a thin dark tan head forms after pouring, but it doesn't last long, no lacing; Aroma is rich with coffee/chocolate, as expected, with a hint of alcohol; Alcohol is the main ingredient in the flavor, also with coffee/chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth, not a lot of carbonation, but tangy nevertheless; This is a very expensive beer, a single bottle ($9.99) costing as much as a six-pack of the mass-popular beers. It also is a very interesting beer - much better than the ever-popular Guinness Stout, but does it justify its costliness? I've had stouts or porters that are at least as good, or better, and with a much more reasonable price tag. It leaves a brown residue in the glass.	3.83
2936	Bomb!	Draught @ Beer Temple, Amsterdam. Black colour. Light brown head with some retention. Aroma's: big roast, umami, chocolate, vegetal/pepper, ground coffee, roast, sweet. Retronasal it’s about the same but different order: sweet, chocolate, peppers, roast, coffee. Flavor is moderate to full sweet, peppery, chocolate. Alcohol feel isn’t as strong as you’d expect with 13%. Medium bodied. Pepper heat is quite mild and not at all as distracting from the flavor as with some beers. Finishes roasty, with moderate bitterness. Really nice, and drinks deceptively easy.	4.06
2937	Bomb!	"Bomb! with Spaceship Earth Coffee. Dateless bottle purchased in Seattle in March 2019.
L: Deep reflecting black hue with thin light carbonation. Thin quickly dissipating head collects around the rim.
S: Cocoa, vanilla, hint of chilis, sweetness, and fresh roasted dark chocolate.
T: Chocolate, candy bar, roasted coffee, finish of vanilla, nutty aftertaste, cocoa lingers, and spiciness from the chilis is not detectable.
F: No heat, slightly viscous, chilis spice come out slightly on the lips.
O: Very drinkable for 13%. A nice treat that doesn't feel too heavy or viscous that it isn't enjoyable. My first Prairie beer. I can't wait to try all of the other variants."	4.31
2938	Bomb!	Poured into a snifter from a 32 ounce growler.. L: Pours pure black with 1-inch very dark rocky head. Head dissipates relatively quickly leaving a light bit of lacing. It maintains a crown around the edges.. S: Espresso, dark chocolate/cocoa, peppers (not spicy, but if you're familiar with Mole, you know exactly what it is), very faint notes of vanilla and booze. I found myself spending a good bit of time just enjoying the aroma. It's wonderful..  1,188 characters	4.66
2939	Bomb!	12 oz bottle from Woodman's in Waukesha, WI purchased for $6.99. Pours pitch black with a moderate tan head that fades fairly quickly. Aromas and flavor are dark chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malts, and coffee. Almost no heat from the anchos. The 13% abv is well-hidden although you can tell it's a big beer. Overall a delicious beer.	4.43
2940	Bomb!	"P: Black color with thick tan head
A: coffee with a touch of peppers
T: Chocolate upfront followed by coffee and ending with heat.
MF: A little bitterness from the coffee. The more you drink the more the spicyness lingers. This is a sipper but being 13% that’s not exactly a bad thing.
O: Very good imperial stout with an edge."	4.34
2941	Bomb!	Had on tap at Flying Saucer - Houston. It was very good. Did not taste the alcohol, but it was extremely dark chocolate taste, which was very very bitter.	4.15
2942	Bomb!	"12 oz. bottle poured into a becher.. Slick, blackish and slightly oily it goes down easy from the start. The reddish tan head is tight and the action of raising and lowering the glass is enough to maintain one quarter of an inch of micro-bubble foam. There is some slick lacing that quickly slides back into the foam cap with every drink, all in all better than I expected considering the 13% ABV. A nose that is almost robust is roasty and full of coffee and cocoa with occasional hints of sweet vanilla. The heat from the pepper and alcohol combine for a smooth burn that
along with the medium to heavy, soft and viscous body combine for an enjoyable finish. I had no idea a pepper beer could be this good."	4.5
2943	Bomb!	Pours black with a small tan head that vanished quickly. Nice aroma with dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla, peppers, and coffee. Tastes just like it smells. Same exact score as a result. Medium bodied with modest carbonation. The 14 % abv is hidden very well. A nicely made beer.	4.13
2944	Bomb!	Bomb pours a thick, motor oil black with very little head that quick recedes leaving no lacing. The smell is cacao nibs over chili peppers with just a hint of coffee and some alcohol. The taste is very complex, full bodied on the palette. Drinks smooth for a 13% ABV beer, with the slightest hint of booze on the finish. It's a very thick cacophony of flavors from the coffee, cacao nibs, to the chili peppers and vanilla, but there is an underlying burnt wood flavor that lingers.	4.51
2945	Bomb!	Pours seal brown with a paltry skim of khaki foam. Aroma is positively rife with dark chocolate, accented by toffee, chili peppers, coffee, and roasted malt.. The taste features a melange of roasted malt, coffee, chilis, marshmallow, and brown sugar up front, augmented by earthy hops that settle in behind the more overt spiciness of the chilis. Warming coaxes out notes of dark chocolate and vanilla while invigorating the chili spice. Hefty body and moderate carbonation make for a full, substantive mouthfeel.. Overall, this is a beefy, flavorful stout that may have a little too much going on for its own good. I've never been a big believer in chili peppers in beer, and while these ones don't exactly run roughshod over the other ingredients, they clearly hold more sway, quite possibly to its detriment. Nevertheless, it remains a robust, warming offering on a cold winter's night.	3.82
2946	Bomb!	Not the best imperial stout I've had, but definitely top 3 or 4. I like the heat, but I think it should be dialed down SLIGHTLY to emphasize more of the cocoa nibs and coffee. Absolutely delicious, though and I wish I could rate into the tenths better on this app. Overall, I feel it handsomely earns it's rating. Must have!	4.47
2947	Bomb!	(12 oz bottle, no dating, 13% abv... poured into a fat tulip). L: dark brown, almost black liquid; med-dark brown foam, inch+ high on pour, recedes rather quick, losing a shade or two of darkness in the process... no lacing. S: chilies and cocoa powder straight away, with ground espresso slowly emerging; the vanilla isn't overt, but certainly colors the overall smell... little hint of booze of which its spice may or may not be accented by the chilies... nice aromas, but overall intensity curiously restrained.  1,461 characters	4.39
2948	Bomb!	Not finding a date on the bottle, just a couple stamps without much meaning to the drinker. This is my first beer from Prairie and I’ve been eyeing it for a while on the shelf at Grassroots in Jax wondering about the hype. At $9 for a 12oz bottle one has to assume this is not just a great, but stellar beer.. I chose this as a celebration beer for one of the biggest moments of my life. A true “bomb” of a result/outcome and couldn’t be happier, though also still shocked. Probably need to sleep and a new morning will bring clarity.. But this beer is also bringing clarity. That it is almost certainly worth the cost. And that just because a beer includes hot peppers doesn’t mean they’ll overwhelm nor serve as a reason to shun a beer with such an ingredient..  1,434 characters	4.76
2949	Bomb!	Bottled 9/28/18, consumed 12/9/18. Poured deep, oily, pitch black with no head at all and no lacing. Aroma is of cacao and chili peppers with a little bit of coffee, definitely improves as it warms. Taste is rich, sweet chocolate, coffee, and lesser notes of vanilla and caramel malts. The pepper serves to warm and thankfully doesn't dominate the taste at all. Feel is medium, could definitely stand to be a bit fuller & thicker, lower carbonation, high ABV worked in very well.. Overall fell just a tad shy of expectations from such a lofty reputation. Certainly enjoyed it though and will be looking to try more from Prairie.	4.26
2950	Bomb!	"LOOK: Very dark/black - no light or even a glow - dark tan head - about 1/2 finger - less than hoped but ok for style and high ABV
SMELL: Rich chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Sweet and dessert-like. ABV is so high you can smell the alcohol. Some woody notes but all ingredients are identifiable.
TASTE: Huge blast of chocolate and charred wood. Then the coffee, toffee, vanilla, and malt come through briefly only to be swept aside by a powerful alcohol bite. The alcohol goes through the nose and you feel it down to your toes. A definite warming feeling kicks in. It starts to heat up then with some of the chili peppers. It has a decent earthiness and spice with the peppers there. Trails off with some earthiness, roasted nuts, and wood. There is a slight funkiness and weird aftertaste that I didn't care for but it subsided quickly.
FEEL: A bit thinner than I expected but still a decent full bodied beer. Some carbonation remains after a few minutes, but pretty much flat after that. Expected with a super high 13% ABV
OVERALL: A really good beer. It just had a few shortcomings that I couldn't score higher on. The off flavor that pops up here and there is unpleasant. Not as aromatic as hoped with so many ingredients, and quite low on carbonation. Still would not be afraid to buy this one again. I hoped for more chili peppers and heat with the mention of peppers, but it is pretty subdued. There wasn't enough coffee for me either."	4.05
2951	Bomb!	"Dark brown-black colour, reduced foam.
The smell is extraordinary, 5/5: woody notes, cognac barrel, sour cherry liquor, coffee, red wine.
The taste has a strong expresso influence initially, with strong acidity, then sour cherries in alcohol, dark chocolate, licorice, sweet vanilla. Oily and persistent, with some spicy notes (probably form the chili).
The strong alcohol content is not hidden, but actually present in a really nice warming way, as a good cognac.
The wood is delicately felt on the background.
A really really good beer with its own specific character!"	4.74
2952	Bomb!	"Poured a motor oil black with an above average body. Carbonation is medium light which overall produced a really nice body
Aroma is coffee, roasted malt, and chilli peppers.
Taste follows the aroma with coffee taking the lead followed by the roasted malt . The chilli pepper was very present and the heat was really well incorporated, never overpowering but very much there.
Overall it is an excellent beer, definitely above average on every level
Only criticism is that sometimes the chilli tasted a bit like unripe green peppers."	4.25
2953	Bomb!	Nice and dark, poured nicely. Smells amazing.. Good coffee flavor upfront with a nice hint of heat at the finish. The heat sort of lingers and is great.. Good thick velvety mouth feel. Chewy and delicious.	4.21
2954	Consecration	Mostly clear chestnut brown with dark tinting, no head save a thin off-white ring. Lovely and expressive red wine barrel with oak, brett, lacto, dried cherry, currant, and sour plum. Taste really does stand out, was skeptical given the hype and specifically the age of the hype, but the red wine makes this sour, playing with the oak, fruits including the addition of green apple and date, flowers, funk, brett, and lacto really well. Almost has a wine pouched cherry aftertaste with oak. Starts wet and vinous, but slowly and steadily makes its way to a drier and wood tannin laden finish, with green sour and funky textures in between, with all three phases melding into one another, best aspect of the beer. Stands the test of time, well done!	4.45
2955	Consecration	A - Very dark amber; reddish 3/4 inch head that dissipates quickly; active bubbling.. S - Wine; cherries; prunes.. T - Sour cherries and grapefruit, but sourness not overly powerful; mild bitterness..  343 characters	4.45
2956	Consecration	Received from @bum4ever in a BIF box. Poured from cork and cage bottle into a teku glass. It pours a pretty ruby-orange color. The thin, ecru-colored head dissipated rapidly. On the nose there is red wine, oak, cherry, brown sugar, and Brett yeast. It's highly fragrant. As expected, it's both sweet and sour with tart cherry and currant, red wine grapes, and vinegar, tobacco and oak notes. It finishes surprisingly bitter. The flavors blend very well. It is well-carbonated and drinks below its 10% ABV. Overall, it is a highly flavorful and pleasing ale. I'm very happy to have had the chance to savor it.	4.47
2957	Consecration	"375ml bottle, that was bottled on '022218'.
Amber brown colored body, with a hint of red currants. The pour resulted in a slightly organized skim of surface bubbles, but this quickly disappears. Has a partial bubble fed ring. No lacing.
Aroma of currants and cherry, with a solid component of red wine oak barrel. Has a sweet and slightly funky yeast note.
Taste is a tremendous combination of red wine oak barrel, the added currant fruit, and the wild nature of the yeast. Notes of tobacco and slight funk. Rather wet and juicy at the end.
Medium mouth feel, slightly tight vinous quality. Good carbonation.
I really enjoyed this beer. Shares a lot of characteristics with a good Cabernet Sauvignon wine, but is more complex with the malts and yeasty funk. Also really hides the higher ABV% well."	4.62
2958	Consecration	Meager dusting of tan foam which is pretty much gone just as the pour settles, in turn no lacing to speak of but one really wasn’t expecting much of either. Light and fully transparent brownish red with wide yellow rims, while the bubbles are about as miniscule as imaginable there are steady streams of them. The sour cherry scents stunted by caramelized brown sugar and molasses notes, touch of coconut flakes, more vinegary than vinous, turns to pie dough and Ovaltine, not as high-toned as expected nor as generally powerful. Medium-bodied, has acidic punch and feels very firm in the mouth. The cherry, currant fruit flavors strong here but so is the oak. Grilled nuts, cocoa, molasses to at times more American oak dill accents. Clean attack, gets funkier towards the finish and retronasally. No astringency, dryness or deep puckering sensations, balanced and approachable. No alcoholic heat either. Even as one notes this, it bears the stamp of a wild ale, albeit mannered. The grip extends the texture a good bit after the flavors have subsided. Not discerning noticeable change as it warms towards room temperature. Suavely arrayed.	4.06
2959	Consecration	July 27th, 2015 - Legendary and luxurious, I now get to have the Consecration fresh from the tap. Dark and with soda like bubbles on the edge, it gives off a power and luscious smell of sour cherries and candied apples, bright and beautiful. And the flavor gives much the same, with a perfect, perfect sourness and a perfect acidity. The flavor notes feature juicy bordeaux grapes and even a bit of sparkling grape juice. It's far better than it sounds, and absolutely lands the acidity.	4.51
2960	Consecration	Pours a fairly clear dark red color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. Very little to no lacing. Aroma of sour dark fruits and red wine. Tart and smooth taste. Red wine and dark fruits. Very good.	4.22
2961	Consecration	Bottled 1 year ago.. Pours deep ruby red with a short-lived head.. The nose is strawberry, black cherry, green apple, and rose petals..  349 characters	4.46
2962	Consecration	Terrific beer with amazing Brett. Great dank smell with perfect balance between darkness and sour. Great level of carbonation and an absolute pleasure to drink.	4.67
2963	Consecration	375ml bottle. Oak forward nose with a lot of vanillins. Very vinous with a lot of cab-sauv, which the currants meld with seamlessly. Notes of cocoa and spice cake too. Taste is more spice cake forward, but with a nice layer of baryard funk and phenol too. Vinous again with a big cab sauv character. Currant tartness manifests toward the end. Big and round cab sauv feel, but with gentle carbonation too. Toasty, oaky, and nutty with cocoa blooming on the finish. Great.	4.43
2964	Consecration	Pours a ruby-burgundy with a light fog. Head formation is nearly non-existent. Aroma is grapes, currants and oak all layered over a lactic acid sourness. Very straight forward, and focused. Flavor profile is grapes, black currants, oak, toffee and toasted and nutted malts. While it starts with sweet fruit, it ends with a lactic sour twist that lingers on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth, glossy texture. Overall, a very good sour that mixes fruits well with an underlying and unmistakable sourness.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 375mL bottle. Bottled 6/17/15, consumed 9/9/18.	4.46
2965	Consecration	Leather, oak, funk, dark fruit, leather, sour stout, leather, acidity, and more leather. Almost as though the a sweaty leather strap soaked in the bottle for a while. It's on the verge of being astringent and bitter and to me the leather overwhelms everything else this beer has to offer. Kind of disappointed in my first RR beer.	3.95
2966	Consecration	7/19/18...on tap at Monks in Philadelphia. Tulip glass pour. Dark mahogany brown. Low foam. Still. Currants cherries and oak in the nose. Light sour, heavy wood. Mellow and sneaky boozy. Lots of wood. Cabernet all throughout. Fantastic.	4.31
2967	Consecration	Dark ruby in color with excellent clarity. There's a minimal amount of a fingernail of beige on top. The aroma is packed with Cabernet, tart Brettanomyces, and woodsy oak. The mouth is very dry and moderately carbonated.	4.26
2968	Consecration	Bottled 07/18/16.. Pours a ruddy brownish red. Clear, with an off-white finger of foam which dissipates rapidly, despite being fed by a steady stream of small bubbles from the bottom. The yeast sediment is firmy stuck to the bottom of the bottle, and the careful pour that the label suggests proves unwarranted.. I'm not really a wine drinker, but the initial aroma is strongly red wine-like. .  793 characters	4.4
2969	Consecration	Pretty good. Smells better than it tastes. Aroma is slight with a little bit of sour cherry, says it’s refermented on bottle. Enjoy the smooth bite at top of taster, and had some flavours of the Chardonnay but still had some tendencies of beer instead of drinking a glass of wine. Enjoy!	4.33
2970	Consecration	The most deceptive 10% ABV beer I've enjoyed to-date. I've had beers that mask higher ABV with massive flavors, i.e. super hopping, bourbon barrel aging, tons of malt, massive fruit additions, etc. but this beer does so with seeming simplicity and grace.. Purplish reddish hue with a puffy, soapy head that dimpled, sagged and then faded away.. Aroma and taste is a balanced dance between jammy fruit, oak, funk and tart. There's sweet and slightly puckering fruit that feels like a mélange of berries - blackberry, raspberry - followed by plump red wine grapes and then red wine itself..  768 characters	4.53
2971	Consecration	Pours a dark mahogany color with quickly dissipating white head leaving a tiny ring of bubbly lacing. Nose is dark stone fruit ,currants and funky yeast. Taste follows with a little sweet-tartness and red wine barrel woodiness. May be the best sour I have tried, reminds me of some of the Flemish ales I drank in Belgium.	4.48
2972	Consecration	From bottle dated 12/16. Great funk and red wine on the nose. Taste is quite complex. Bright in the beginning, funky and barrel in the middle, extremely tart on the finish. This is a good sour but somehow lacks drinkability and overall harmony in flavor for me.	4.21
2973	Consecration	"Russian River Brewing Co. ""Consecration""
375 ml brown glass bottle, corked and caged, ""BOTTLED ON:100316"" and sampled on 040718
$15.99 @ The Beer Yard (The Beverage Store), Wayne, PA. Notes via stream of consciousness: This isn't the first time I've had Consecration, and it probably won't be the last, but expensive bottles are few and far between for me these days, especially when there are so many new beers out there as well. This, however, has always been a favorite for me, even within the Russian River family of beers so here goes... it's brown in color beneath a very short-lived head of off-white foam. It disappears almost immediately, but that's common for sour beers. As this was a long standing bottle all of the sediment was finely packed and remained at the base of the bottle and it's quite clear. It has some very nice ruby highlights to it. In the nose it's fruity and oaky, vinous and funky. It reminds me of a Flemish brown ale but different. The flavor follows with some added maltiness that's got some caramel to it, and a stiff bitterness. The currant is clear but not too bright, blending in with the rest of the beer so that it becomes one rounded flavor rather than pieces that aren't so finely put together. This one has it all, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus, and Lactobacillus and it shows - yet at the same time it's very refined, there must be some good blending going on in its production. It's earthy, a bit leathery, kind of grassy like wet straw, and even slightly metallic. It's not too tart or sour though, and I don't think that many would be turned away by it. Well, at least people who knew they were going to drink a sour beer, and unlike many other sour beers there is some bitterness there as well. But is that from hops or the currant? And it really is the currant that really makes this work, and what makes it stand out. I don't think I've ever had a currant beer either before or after this, and it's really unusual. It's so refreshing and livening, and although it's a little like dark cherries and black grapes it's really something different altogether. In the mouth it's medium in body and delicately effervescent and caressing. Wow, what a special beer. This is absolutely world class. Even the best Belgian sour producers would have to look at this with at least a little bit of awe. Haha, so I've reminded myself that even though it's expensive, it's really worth it. I could spend the same amount and get twice as much volume in a fairly good wine, but would it satisfy me as much? No, for me, I'm sure of that. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant, I'm not sure what else to say. Seek it out.
Review# 5,933"	4.52
2974	Consecration	Taster at brewery. Dark amber with small ring of head. Soft, fruity aroma, Brett. Taste is smooth and sweet, mildly tart. Subdued, but complex. This is what sours should be. Simple and clean, approachable.	4.03
2975	Consecration	Let me first say I don't like sours but I'm trying to see if I can develop a taste for them. This review more reflects my particular taste of the style than where this beer fits inside the style. This is a nicely complex beer and I would recommend to anyone who likes sour ales.. Bottled 3/27/2017. Color is beautiful, dark brown orange, head is whispy and dissipated quickly. Smell is very complex and interesting, definitely enticing. The taste is complex as well, hints of oak, fruit from the currant slightly citrusy balsamic vinegar, some malty bread character but dominated in the middle and end with sour, tart funk. The mouth feel is very carbonated which comes from the bottle conditioning. It's makes it extra bubbly but also nearly insubstantial on the palate and fills your stomach like a stressed balloon. I feel more full than I should..  1,121 characters	3.86
2976	Consecration	This is as close to perfect as it gets. Unbelievably pungent and pleasant smell courtesy of Napa Valley wine barrels. The taste is tart... No, wait, not tart — sour. It follows the smell well. This tastes natural, real, full. What a great wild ale. In my opinion, there is only one way to surpass this — get a Supplication bottle.	4.9
2977	Consecration	"Just a knock down, drag out good beer. Maybe I am getting cynical over today's craft beer culture or nostalgic over chasing this beer, but hands down it sets the standard for American sour beer.. The best part about this beer is the body. So many sours are too thin and lack the sweetness to balance out the tart. Most breweries try to compensate for the sour by adding in a ton of sweet fruit, but RR balances their beers with hearty malt backbones and unfermentable sugars that round out the mouthfeel and tartness at the same time. The 10% abv puts this in a league of its own.. No, its not the best or most forward thinking sour, but it doesn't try to be. It is the most balanced ""extreme beer"" there is and it is a real treat to drink..  755 characters"	4.74
2978	Consecration	This beer pours a deep purple with a minimal, quickly dissipating head. The aroma is heady and intense, with a strong acetic sour notes, as well as sour cherry jam, blackberry jam, black currant jam, with hints of fig, and graham cracker. The flavor is intense and incredibly complex, with the black currant coming through very strongly, and then a tannic burst that is enormously wine like. There is a chutney tinged, vinegar flavor to the middle, and an almost smoky finish. The mouthfeel is light with bold, bright carbonation. Overall this is an astonishing beer. Probably the best sour I have ever had.	5
2979	Pseudo Sue	L: Pours a gorgeous cloudy light orange with a nice, thick whiteish/off-white head that quickly diminishes to a soapy collar which lingers for a while.. S: One of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Strong fruity scent of orange and grapefruit with the tiniest hint of citrusy spice and hopps.. T: Where to begin? Orange and grapefruit are present the second it hits your palate, but quickly give way to a mild hoppy bite with a strong grassy notes and mild citrus spice. The hopps and grass linger a bit, and a touch of pine settles in..  911 characters	4.92
2980	Pseudo Sue	Revised review. I don't stand down from my original, this beer lacks the bitterness and or intensity to score world class. The only beer in this pathetic genre (that would be the NE IPA genre) that scores world class is the bitter, juicy fruit, Alcemist Focal Banger. But this one I had month or so ago? did keep my interest enough to seek it out again Will I go a third time? IDK, $13.50 for 4 is not that bad .... The review? Gorgeous opaque color, amazing fresh, fruity aromas, you pick the fruits I don't care, I'm not an fruit person. But very fresh, very fruity. Smooth, but my problem with this beer is that the intensity of the first smell and sip doesn't last. Then again, the icon, SNPA, and or my favorite pale Daisy Cutter is the same way. Real good, but not big enough for me, after all these years. So, is this an pale or what I would say NE IPA single? Who cares, t's' very good. Get it again? We'll see .... to be continued ( I hope). Looking forward to Friday's release of CBS, at reasonable prices, I hear. X5k, out.	4.09
2981	Pseudo Sue	Murky creamsicle orange in color. Poured with a short, soapy white foam with medium low retention. Sharo citrus tangerine and under ripe pineapple with a light dankness. Medium malty aromas. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Creamy rich, silky smooth feel followed by boozy warmth that gets a little prickly at the finish. Citrus and pineapple hop flavors with a solid malt backbone. Spicy bitterness slowly expands through the middle. Pine hop and sharp citrus notes on the backend along with fruity flavors and boozy warmth. Finished semi-dryly with light fruity notes and lingering pine hop bitterness. Light fruity notes and malt provide just enough balance with fantastic, fresh, complex hop character. Smooth, creamy feel with pleasant bitterness and just a touch of dankness. This was excellent.	4.4
2982	Pseudo Sue	The hazy orange amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1” layer of frothy white foam that recedes slowly but noticeably to a cap and then eventually to a ring and a thin irregular island of foam on the surface while leaving a web of some legs and rings and large patches of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates some small patches and irregular legs of lacing.. The firmly present aromas include some citrus (orange and grapefruit), some tropical fruit (mango and lychee) and a bit of zest that seems almost resinous, all against a lightly caramel malt background.. The flavors are basically as expected from the nose with the orange, grapefruit, mango, lychee and zest all noticeable and intertwingled with each other. The touch of light bitterness from the zest is softened by a touch of caramel malt sweetness that shows but is even further in the background..  1,556 characters	4.35
2983	Pseudo Sue	16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 8/23/19, so 6 weeks old.. Thick, murky orange juice colored body with a big bubbly white head leaving nice lacing.. Good aroma of non citrus fruit..  557 characters	4.25
2984	Pseudo Sue	"Poured from a 16oz can with a canned on date of 9/18/19; into a pub glass.
Appearance- very cloudy straw yellow, but with so many bubbles, it pierces the haze; thick, soapy white head that leaves nice sudsy lacing!
Smell- a fruit basket on the senses, with mango, pineapple, peach, some orange and an undertone of grass and earth!
Taste - presents more grapefruit and pine than you get from the nose; still some of the flavors that come through on first whiff, but definitely overshadowed; big flavor either way!
Feel - certainly more NE style IPA, as opposed to APA; very good and thoroughly enjoyed, just misclassified.
Overall- spectacular beer, but more so for the hop heads or haze craze crowd; if you’re more the traditional APA fan, you should probably look elsewhere!"	4.05
2985	Pseudo Sue	Had poured from pint can, bottom stamped “PKG06/27/19” and “BEST BY 10/25/19,” into nonic pint.. Pseudo Sue is not unattractive (except for yeast floaties), and has an unassuming but pleasant aroma, so the beautiful, complex and balanced tropical and light malt flavors and hop bite are a complete but happy surprise.	4.18
2986	Pseudo Sue	"Pours an opaque straw color with a bit under a finger of head. The nose has notes of both melon and citrus fruits. The flavor has the expected pine and citrus notes. The bitterness lingers on and on. The body is on the lighter side of the style and the mouthfeel is resiny.. This is a very tasty offering even if it does not quite live up to the hype.. Also, much like Zombie Dust, this ""APA"" is much closer to an IPA than to the standard bearer of the style - SNPA."	4.3
2987	Pseudo Sue	One of the truly special Pale Ales put there. Incredible aromas - citrus, and dank outdoors. Extremely refreshing flavor, with a solid level of dryness in the finish.. Not sure I would’ve pulled this one out of the cooler had it not been for BA... but worth the $5.50 price for the 16oz can!	4.62
2988	Pseudo Sue	Beautiful citra hop showcase and just an overall spectacular I(not A)PA. Densely flavorful, fresh squeezed citrus, plus some mango and other tropical fruit absolutely overwhelm the feeble attempts at malt balance. Canned 8/8, this lives up to the hype in my opinion.	4.62
2989	Pseudo Sue	"16 oz can poured into an imperial shaker.. Appearance
Hazed-out, cloudy blonde. 1 finger of creamy white head.. Nose
Mango, dank, passion fruit, pine, candy sugar, and honey. Very aromatic!.  612 characters"	4.54
2990	Pseudo Sue	Pours hazy orange color. Looks like a typical NEIPA. Mix of small and larger, fluffier bubbles in the head.. Smell of green, citrus, mango, rind right from the crack of the can. Smell dies down after a bit and it becomes a little harder to find.. Mouthfeel is nice, medium to full body. Very refreshing drink. Watery, not much bitterness to dry out the mouth..  827 characters	3.49
2991	Pseudo Sue	"Can Date: 7/12/19
Palate Contaminants: none. The color is very light for what I'm used to. I'll call it straw. Reasonable amount of head, yet not much lacing.. Smell is mostly pine sap and desiccated pineapple. Very light malt scent..  640 characters"	4.29
2992	Pseudo Sue	"16 oz can, dated 8/8/19 so about 3 weeks old. pours a very hazy pale yellow color. foamy thin head that eventually fades. no lacing. aroma leans towards citrus, but not really a very strong aroma. taste is mildly sweet, heavy on orange and grassy flavor, but a touch of odd aftertaste. the moderate bitterness it has is harsh. thin to medium bodied.
underwhelming considering the hype."	3.74
2993	Pseudo Sue	Poured from a can dated 9/30/19. Approximately 1 inch of foamy white head. moderate retention with nice lacing. Appearance is dark yellow, cloudy and nearly opaque. Smell is of strong citrus on the crack of the can-orange and grapefruit predominant. Taste is a very slight amount of juicy with strong resiny bitterness in the back of the mouth. Beer has a juicy soft smoothness with a fairly strong bitter aftertaste. Very good beer overall.	4.25
2994	Pseudo Sue	This is the second offering I've tried from Toppling Goliath, the first being Dorothy's.. Appearance - Poured into a pint glass, we have a bright citrus color. Under the light, it's pale, cloudy, and has large white particles floating in it.. Smell - There's immediate strong citrus notes bursting from the beer while pouring it. Very pleasant and enjoyable..  654 characters	3.84
2995	Pseudo Sue	Poured a cloudy, yellow-orange body with one-finger soapy head and lace patches. The aroma is basically mango and grapefruit with some earthy hoppiness. Sweet beer, medium to thick body, with great tropical fruit sweetness with hints of mango, low key bitterness, hidden booze, clean finish, minimal malts, and overall easy to drink.	4.14
2996	Pseudo Sue	Slightly hazy yellow gold with lasting head. Pineapple, papaya, mango, generally tropical, citrus, pine. Flavor is similar with more of a pine and citrus (grapefruit) presence. Bit of booze. Moderately bitter. Grapefruit aftertaste.	3.89
2997	Pseudo Sue	Pours a pale gold, some sediment. Pine, sweet corn, pleasant grassiness. Orange peel, orange juice, grass, dry grapefruit finish.  183 characters	4.34
2998	Pseudo Sue	DATE: August 4, 2019... OCCASION: a great day of shopping for new home furniture finished with a first massage... GLASSWARE: HopDevil nonick... pours a dense, opaque, sandy yellow-orange body that appears creamy... its head is off-white, soapy-sudsy, with small sun flares arching above... intense, robust grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, thick resin and pine that brings a forest onto the plains like ... chewy, medium-bodied, juicy to the point of inducing salivic reactions on impact... its finish is creamy, lively, thick between the teeth with a rattling vibrancy--almost dangerous in its drinkability... filling, a meal almost in itself, and a balanced sipper when paired with teriyaki beef and pot stickers... only 45 IBUs? its 6.8% ABV belies its pale ale moniker... in fact, this may be too big for its own good: the grapefruit, orange/lemon mashup, and resin are so hopped up, it definitely takes the style beyond its easy-drinking pace and depth.... the Citra provides a strong, nuanced profile rife with fruit, pine, and floral qualities... the malt bill is present but only as a base for weight, light toasted bread... so glad this is available at Liquor Factory, in can and draft...	4.45
2999	Pseudo Sue	I find this very similar to Pompeii but Pompeii is more flavorful, more interesting, more things going on. So I'm not sure why I would get this one over Pompeii, unless Pompeii is not available.	3.75
3000	Pseudo Sue	Bottled fall 2015;drank 11/22/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Semi-opaque dull orange/yellow appearance; lots of white flotsam.. Minimal white head; minimal lace..  332 characters	3.98
3001	Pseudo Sue	Golden-orange, pure juice body, medium haze, more of a covering film than head, and almost no lacing. Fruit juice all the way.. Aromas are really wonderful, with huge citrus and big tropical fruit, but not the overripe, overly sweet kind. Grassy, but not overly so, with a little pine and some nice white wine notes. Really well done.. Flavors are a bit of a watered down version of the above. Citrus, slightly underripe tropical fruit, light berry, very grassy, little bit of dankness, and a strong mineral note. Quite good, but a bit of a let down after the nose..  777 characters	4.02
3002	Pseudo Sue	The one-half inch creamy white head quickly drops to a quarter of an inch and then drops. The coating foamy lace accentuates a PBGC dimpled mug. The beer is hazy, irridescent, pale gold.. The initial aroma is strong pine resin with mango. Herbal grass balances before taking over in the middle. Towards the end, it progresses to grapefruit rind which becomes more dominant with slight warmth.. The flavor is what I consider to be a bitter East Coast style with sweetness that almost balances. Grapefruit and blood oranges are the primary notes. The finish is long and moderate..  870 characters	4.09
3003	Pseudo Sue	-in speigelau ipa glass.. A: Oxidized orange juice coloring, very similar to their hopsmack, when fully poured in the glass, shows off its dense, yeasty, and lactose nature. Milky orange with a building 3 finger tusk white head that again was amazingly resilient. Lots of micro-bubbly carbonation texture, dances emphatically about with a swirling nature of micro-yeasty particles dancing in the swift current.. S: Peaches and sugary grapefruit highlight the opening aroma, wet, with some tropical pineapple, of medium awareness. Wet citrus, very smooth. Had their Hopsmack the day before and thought that had a bit more pronounced nose. Have to say a bit disappointed after all the raves and hype over this. Best by 07.05.19. Consumed 06.22.19. Thought this lacked a bit of strength and complexity..  1,917 characters	4.16
3004	Wide Awake It's Morning	Pours dark brown with ruby highlights at 56 degrees; thick tan foam of mixed bubbles; solid ring, long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; thin legs. Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best.	4.58
3005	Wide Awake It's Morning	Pours black with a half inch khaki head that leaves very little lacing. Smells is very maple syrup forward with bacon, coffee and toast coming in the background. Tastes of maple syrup, coffee, molasses, toast, bacon, roasted malts, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Full bodied especially for a porter, lightly carbonated, thick and creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish.	4.46
3006	Wide Awake It's Morning	Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle.	4.5
3007	Wide Awake It's Morning	Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown covering nearly all of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of coffee, maple syrup, and bacon fat. I’m tasting maple syrup, dark chocolate, coffee, and smoky bacon fat. The dark chocolate and coffee really linger after the swallow. The mouth is oily, viscous, and lightly sticky and chewy.	4.29
3008	Wide Awake It's Morning	A: loads of maple syrup and coffee, chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. Very smooth and balanced. A: black with medium brown head.. F: smooth coffee, coffee, and coffee. With maple and vanilla. Chocolate and molasses follow just like the nose..  476 characters	4.18
3009	Wide Awake It's Morning	Pours dark brown, almost black in color with a big, spongy beige head, vanishing fast.. Smells of all the advertized adjuncts, foremost highlighting the beer‘s coffee, which gets even more pronounced by the sweet maple syrup, inheriting an additional blueberry quality.. Has a slightly creamy, medium body with just enough finely integrated carbonation to add a refreshing note to the beer..  911 characters	3.25
3010	Wide Awake It's Morning	Smooth, tasty, and delicious smelling. What else can I say? Basically if a stout and a maple syrup covered pancake joined forces and had a baby together you'd get this beer. Would've liked a hint of bacon, but overall I can't complain.	4.88
3011	Wide Awake It's Morning	Bottled 04/19/18. Soooo much better than MBCP, but I’m blaming the fact that the base beer wasn’t fresh when I had it two days ago. This is not only “fresher,” but holds up much better in the bottle. This is how I expected the original to taste and smell.. This is almost literally like being at a fancy donut shop and taking their maple bacon donut, some of their espresso/dark roast, and putting both in a blender. Then adding some deliciously roasted malt, a bit of earthy wood, and some booze. Such a sweet treat!. Today is the big day. Hoping for good news soon.	4.69
3012	Wide Awake It's Morning	L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark, mahogany brown color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a half inch of creamy, off white, fairly long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.. S: A very enticing aroma of maple syrup, coffee, bacon, malt, caramel, and chocolate.. T: Tasted of a moderate amount of coffee (not as much as I expected), lots of maple syrup, a bit of chocolate (not overly prevalent), mild notes, some malt, and a hint of caramel. This is a big, complex flavor. It's a little weird and chalky in the finish, but it definitely does its job. It's sweet, rich, and quite delicious..  765 characters	4.38
3013	Wide Awake It's Morning	Appearance - The beer poured brownish black in color with a tan head.. Smell - Maple and coffee dominated the nose.. Taste - As expected, the nose was very maple coffee forward. I was disappointed as there was not much bacon. As the taste continued, the coffee grew more bitter in back..  424 characters	4.6
3014	Wide Awake It's Morning	Dark with a rich creamy tan head. Smells of coffee, smoke, maple and chocolate. Tastes follow the smell. Really sweet and a lot of coffee with the smokiness. Finishes with s char bitterness. Delicious beer.	4.62
3015	Wide Awake It's Morning	"Blind review. Sent in NBS BIF#8 from roguer. Poured into tulip. Bottled 4/19/18
Pours jet black, rocky mocha head of just about an inch.
Nose is maple cookies (my stepmom makes these maple cookies, they don’t taste good but they smell amazing), vanilla, hazelnut? Or nuts in general?
Upon first sip, maple for sure, like a lot of maple, maybe more maple, sweetness, strawberry (could be from sweetness) vanilla, lactose sweetness, smoke, pancakes (malts) mild roast, mild coffee. Me trying to breakdown the maple syrup-caramel and/or brown sugar.
As it warms, strawberry and nuttiness disappears, smoke and slight char become more present.
The body is medium but smooth with a lingering maple sweetness at the finish.
From the pour, I let this warm up for 45 minutes or so. I’ve decided that it’s some sort of adjunct (maple bomb) imperial stout/porter from Funky Buddha."	4.46
3016	Wide Awake It's Morning	03/2015 - so much maple syrup on the nose, plus coffee and bready aromas; incredible iced coffee-like flavors, lovely maple syrup yet not sickly sweet, some lactose, and a bit of salt on the palate; roasty bitterness finishes it off.	4.39
3017	Wide Awake It's Morning	"From a fresh growler:
Look: Black with tan head/lacing
Smell: Big nose - sweet maple syrup, smoky malts, bacon, coffee
Taste: Tasty with hints of sweet maple (think breakfast syrup), bacon, salted caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, malts.
Feel: Heavy body; smooth.
Overall: Excellent. Recommended."	4.56
3018	Wide Awake It's Morning	this thing is a beast, even more packed with all of these awesome flavors than the maple bacon is, but without the unifying and mellowing barrel elements of the morning wood. big thanks to my homie for bringing this one over for maple beer night, i had not ever seen it before, but have loved its two sister beers! its as thick and dense looking as it seems like it should be, near black but a high luster and some nice thick foamy tan head. it smells more like coffee than anything else, seemingly higher in the proportionality than in the maple bacon, a little less smoke and greasiness and all too, and still with a high maple sweetness element. there is a lot of nuance here too though like black pepper and fresh tobacco and molasses. its as complex in the flavor too, but we are all sort of stunned at how this isnt super insanely sweet. i mean its still way more sugary than you could reasonably drink a whole bomber of, but this is not over the top at all, despite the maple flavor still being really potent in here. nice almost burnt dark malt complexion to even it out, and all the coffee really helps. i didnt catch a bottle date, but the coffee tastes pretty fresh in here to me, and its intensity cuts some of the weight of the body and the sweetness, i like its contribution a lot. the bacon part of this is a little underwhelming, less obvious in the mix than in the base beer, light campfire smoke is all, this isnt meaty or anything to me. a really intense brew, but as good as any of the wildly flavored stouts these guys do. i dont think it needs the barrel. i enjoyed this edition a lot and it was a great end to our epic maple beer night!	4.31
3019	Wide Awake It's Morning	22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had 11/4/17.. Pours dark, opaque, a little thick looking, with a one inch quickly dissipating head and spotty lacing. Aromas of maple, coffee, malt, bacon, caramel, light chocolate and cocoa, some smoke. Smells terrific. The taste also leads with maple, then malt, coffee, caramel, a little molasses, light chocolate and vanilla, somewhat smoky, maybe a hint of bacon. A little salty, not sweet. Smooth, a little creamy, well carbonated, a little bit of a lighter body feel for the style.. Terrific aroma, very good flavor. All the add-ins blend together really well. The maple and coffee are the stars here. If you have the chance when it’s around, grab a couple of bottles. Good price point, too.	4.27
3020	Wide Awake It's Morning	So much coffee!! But doesn't taste like burn coffee grounds. Like a well balanced DDH....this is the same with coffee aromas and flavors. On the nose is like waking up at your favorite roastery.....but taste is mellow and warming like your own personal barista caring for this cold brew. FB is a top brewery for a reason	4.56
3021	Wide Awake It's Morning	This is pretty much Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. It is extremely sweet as the original but it is better balanced by the higher booze. Pours thick and creamy, crazy to think it's a porter.	4.91
3022	Wide Awake It's Morning	22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Not sure the bottle date.. Pours dark black with a light brown head that is about a finger high. Head slowly disappears leaving some nice lacing.. Aromas of chocolate, maple, coffee, and what I can only assume is bacon. Really interesting nose. Tough to describe properly..  754 characters	4.52
3023	Wide Awake It's Morning	Mostly maple with some coffee. Has a metallic flavor to it. Reminds of waffle crisp cereal, you know, it’s not too bad but leaves an after taste that seems really fake maple. Did not enjoy this very much, prefer Hipster Brunch by quite a bit for a beer with these adjuncts. Finished half the bottle and then went on to something else.	3.26
3024	Wide Awake It's Morning	It's been awhile since I experienced MBCP so was really excited to try this one. It does not disappoint.. Smells like pure maple syrup with just a hint of coffee. Was worried the maple may be over powering but the balance is just about perfect. Maple is present but not too sweet. The smokey roasty quality balances it out nicely.. Would definitely seek this out again.	4.45
3025	Wide Awake It's Morning	Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass, not sure when it was bottled and 9.2% ABV. Pours a very attractive slick black with a 2 plus finger dark tan head that leaves thin wisps of lace at near room temperature.. Smell is maple, dark chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, and a little smoked bacon.. Taste follows but more aggressive than the nose. Maple, bacon, vanilla, and coffee grounds..  712 characters	4.37
3026	Wide Awake It's Morning	Looks exceptionally creamy.. Doesn't smell much more involved than Founders breakfast stout or peche mortel.. Taste it shines. Lots and lots of maple. Though not a lot - the evident hop presence is extremely uncondusive to the character of this beer..  432 characters	4.04
3027	Wide Awake It's Morning	Pours a rather opaque cola brown that leaves a pencil thin ring of off-white tiny bubbles around the edge of the glass. Smell is dominated by the maple syrup up front with a noticeable coffee middle. The mix of the two do a good job of reminding you of sunday breakfast. The taste follows the smell. The second batch was better than the first because it had a much stronger coffee presence. The first batch was more maple dominated whereas the taste of the second batch is more coffee dominant. I definitely prefer the second batch as it is sweet enough and the coffee does a great job of balancing out the sweetness from the maple syrup. There is also a very subtle smoky finish which is the bacon making itself known. I has sticky silky smooth mouthfeel. Not watery, but not viscous, just right for an imperial porter. Overall this beer is really great and they did a great job in improving it over the initial batch. Initial batch was too sweet and had an acridly bitter finish. 2017 was much more balanced and left a smoky sweet aftertaste. Breakfast in a glass!	4.5
3028	Wide Awake It's Morning	Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter. Shared with a few.. Thick black body, tan head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and some lacing.. Heavy maple chocolate on the nose, a little coffee and smoke. Taste is intense maple and a bit smokey, vanilla and chocolate. Maple is a tad artificial. Nice body.	4.5
3029	Pugachev Royale	Thanks to a local for swapping fluids with me & knocking a long, long time want off my list. 12 oz. black-waxed bottle as I celebrate a Twins win & watch the Punisher. It’s a good night. Bottle 1357/1644.. Black. Zero head, or close enough. The nose is intense barrel, with brandy on top, chocolate, touch of bourbon & fruit & a deep sweetness. Smells like a sundae. I like sundaes.. Pugachev Royale is Cobra on performance enhancing drugs. Serious ones. Shit that’d get you a full season suspension in the majors. Shorthand: Cobra with brandy added. Longhand: brandy is ascendant & the bourbon has been shoved far into the background, hitting the back of the throat but little else. A boozy bite complimented liberally by the maple syrup, fudge, spring earth, & rich, rich sweetness. Belly warming. Thick. I could drink more of this. I’d like to..  1,064 characters	4.72
3030	Pugachev Royale	I didn't think you could improve upon the original Pug, but wow this sure does. The brandy barrel is very prominent, and somehow I felt enhanced the maple.	4.85
3031	Pugachev Royale	07/2016 - This is super hot and doesn't hide it, but the nose is chock full of barrel, chocolate, roast, and some anise; the palate kicks ass and is similar to the nose; but the heat lingers and keeps this from being next level for me.	4.23
3032	Pugachev Royale	November 2017 vintage. 18.4% abv. Too hot.. Aroma has inviting chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut and barrel notes but the heat overtakes them. Taste follows suit, but again the level of heat cuts off the flavors quickly. Mouthfeel is thin, hot and numbing on the tongue - really the weakest aspect of the beer, when it sits on your palate for too long (more than 3-4 seconds) your tongue literally burns and goes numb.. My guess is the initial high ratings came from when this beer was a more realistic (under 15%) 14.8% abv..  635 characters	4.25
3033	Pugachev Royale	Appearance was weird. Poured like a thin, fizzy, brownish/black soda. Bubbles dissipated after a minute or so. Aroma was a surprising semi-sweet chocolate-covered cherries drenched in maple syrup. Waaay better than the appearance was suggesting. Taste was similar to the aroma, just a little less. Nicely-complex. 18% alcohol, but tasted more like a 10%er. Mouthfeel was thinner than I wanted, but surprisingly not off-putting (with that fizzy pour.) Overall, I was very impressed that the important aspects, aroma and flavor, were so very good in spite of the look/feel. Would drink this again.	4.84
3034	Pugachev Royale	Dark brown color with a ring of brownish foam. Aroma is boozy with whiskey, rum and brandy notes. Sweet malt, some dark fruits, earthy and woody notes, bitter roasted notes on the finish. Medium to light body with soft carbonation. Complex flavors but a bit light bodied.	4.6
3035	Pugachev Royale	The slappy, watery black pour forms a fizzy, bubbly mocha head that quickly settles to a thin collar. A persistent subsurface fizz visibly push up from the center like a black cauldron, pushing a faint circle of tan bubbles to the edges. A swirl leaves distinct, clear legs on the glass.. The aroma is very complex and delectable, with vanilla and dark chocolate brownie batter taking center stage. At times, Tootsie Roll even comes out, but mature threads of brandy and port sting with potency.. Flavors of semi-sweet dark chocolate syrup and vanilla frosting are pulverized by a substantial and fusile sweet bourbon and brandy character. This is possibly the most expressive barrel character I have experienced in a beer ever, but it's also coming with that heat, which is only amplified by the absurd ABV (this 2017 bottle states 18.4%, not the 14% listed here)..  1,247 characters	3.88
3036	Pugachev Royale	2017 vintage.. A: Pours black with a thin ring of sand colored head. Below average retention, no lacing.. S: Spiritous brandy, rich milk chocolate bar, vanilla bean, light toasted oak, a bit of bourbon and cola. Rich, complex, and well balanced..  618 characters	4.38
3037	Pugachev Royale	Pitch black, zero head, brandy dominates the nose, brandy forward and bourbon on the finish for taste. Nice syrupy mouthfeel. A bit boozy. Very worth trying.	4.53
3038	Pugachev Royale	Poured from a bottle to tulip. Quite opaque. Minimal head. Smells of bourbon and brandy. Taste is chocolate, bourbon and subtle apple brandy. Taste is similar. Very rich. Outstanding brew.	4.46
3039	Pugachev Royale	12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this.. Thick, viscous body, inky black color, dark brown head. Heavy bourbon-chocolate on the nose. On the tongue is dark chocolate, fudgy, roasty malt with a touch of vanilla in the background. Barrel adds a good whiskey flavor. Really nice thick body, rich and fudgy.	4.63
3040	Pugachev Royale	"Vintage: 2015
Consumed: 2017. A: Quaint, black pour with a minor off-white head; evanescent retention and lacing. S: Brandy forefront with oak, a scotch essence, and loads of complexity: dark fruit/figs, leather, vanilla, caramel, chocolate.  750 characters"	4.64
3041	Pugachev Royale	Consumed in tasting snifter, early-March 2017, at a bottle share.. I was really looking forward to finally trying this one.. Solid BBA RIS. There are definitely some that are better, but I would consider this world class.	4.56
3042	Pugachev Royale	Serving type: 2016 vintage at Pugafest.. Deep ebony black with a lasting head of less than an inch (damn you, tiny Pugafest glasses). Smell is of intense bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate, along with a slight dark fruit aroma. Toasted coconut floats around here and there. The taste reflects the smell perfectly. Intense bourbon, milk chocolate, vanilla, and slight toasted coconut flavors meander throughout the taste. Finishes hot (it is the 2016 vintage afterall) with a lingering milk chocolate sweetness. It tastes like we added lactose but we didn't. Feel is thick, viscous, coats the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I'm glad I got the chance to try it and hoard a few bottles of it.	5
3043	Pugachev Royale	Glad I took the time to track this one down! Nice thick oily stout with lots of chocolate and bourbon notes yet extremely smooth and velvety. Nice mocha colored head and really coats the sides of the glass. Enjoyed ever so slowly over a glorious 2 hour movie with family!	4.71
3044	Pugachev Royale	2015 vintage drank in a snifter on 12/29/2016. Look - looks thin other than the deep dark brownish body. Smell-oak, dark fruit, brandy, chocolate, sweet sweetness.  561 characters	4.87
3045	Pugachev Royale	Excellent mouthfeel and flavors so complex it took the entire beer to figure out. The sweet flavors from the brandy merged well with the chocolate and vanilla	4.54
3046	Pugachev Royale	2015 Vintage, enjoyed with several months on it in 2016.. Wow this is one burning hot, boozy, bourbon bomb. Almost painful. I'm a lightweight when it comes to liquor so my score may reflect that.. Didn't get much of the advertised vanilla on the nose, so ding'd it a bit on aroma, but otherwise smells nice (again, smells rather like a snifter of brandy rather than a stout). Pitch black. Body was lovely -- fairly svelte for an imperial stout, but a little bit syrupy in a pleasant way. Taste was chocolatey... but most taste was covered up by the booze..  752 characters	4.17
3047	Pugachev Royale	I was surprised at how rich the taste of chocolate on this one was. Did a side-by-side with the Cobra, which was also excellent, but this naturally had a much greater depth of flavor. Watch out for that abv though!!	4.59
3048	Pugachev Royale	Hangar 24 does great things with their BA selections.... Fantastic nose of bittersweet chocolate, taste is similar with barrel notes and coffee flavors... rich and complex, a real treat	4.91
3049	Pugachev Royale	"2015 Bottle
L: Dark onyx and ebony hues with a thin cinnamon-hued head and minimal retention (although ample legs are present)
S: Bursting with milk chocolate, dark grade B maple syrup, bourbon barrels and a faint Japanese whiskey scent
T: Decadent dessert flavors abound - sweetness upfront swirls around with maple syrup, vanilla beans, cocoa beans, and a swift brandy finish
F: Much thicker than I had anticipated - on par with BCBS
O: Just an absolute treat from start to finish. A dessert-like sweetness is complemented by a bitter dark chocolate and dry bourbon profile that enhances the ultimate complexity of this work of art. Incredibly enjoyable liquid feast - my only complaint is that the size of the bottle isn't 2x as big!"	4.88
3050	Pugachev Royale	No head. Black in color.. Massive amounts of chocolate and bourbon. Oaky. The adjuncts are hard to find. This one is very rich. The brandy brings some richness. As it warms the cocoa shows. Maple and nilla hard to find. Raisin and molasses flavors in the finish.. Full bodied. Very complex and unique brew.	4.46
3051	Pugachev Royale	2014 vintage opened in 6/16. Still some heat to it but it didn't overpower the beer. The maple, brandy, and bourbon are nicely balanced. It's feel is thicker then most but I didn't get the velvety feel I like in great stouts.	4.65
3052	Pugachev Royale	Smells like bourbon and wood, taste of chocolate, chili, lots of booze. The alcohol in this one is really present, maybe let it age for another couple of months so it can soften up a little.	4.33
3053	Pugachev Royale	Excellent chocolate and barrel flavor shines through in this one. The blend of the barrel types coupled with the base stout leads to a very rich and complex stout. I would love to get my hands on another one of these and age it for another year or two.	5
3054	Parabajava	Bottled October 2015; drank 1/9/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Brown/black appearance.. Minimal tan head; minimal lace..  324 characters	4.09
3055	Parabajava	Tasted from bottle. Pours black with thin white head. Aroma of coffee,molasses and cocoa. Thick, sweet and sticky on the mouth. Coffee, cocoa, brown sugar, molasses, caramel flavors. Awesome stout.	4.75
3056	Parabajava	2016 version poured from a 22oz. bottle. Yet another FW beer I love. The coffee is not strong which I prefer. The barrel provides just the right amount of sweetness. Medium low carbonation. Thick.	4.75
3057	Parabajava	"Type: 12-oz. bottle
Glass: Rip Current 8-oz. beer glass
From: Barrelworks in Buellton, Calif.
Price: $10.99

Reviewed as: Russian Imperial Stout
Misc.: 2018 release; No bottled on date. Picked this up along with a Mole Merkin on a quick trip to Barrelworks while waiting to head over to the winery. Had it once before (4.25 on Untappd at the 2017 Firestone Invitational, but that was at the end of the day), but this was the first time I’d seen it in a brewery (or store). Firestone’s website had this as, “Firestone Walker's legendary Parabola barrel-aged imperial stout gets an infusion of fresh-roasted coffee in this limited-edition variant known as Parabajava. The cold-infused coffee melds seamlessly with Parabola's signature dark mocha and bourbon vanilla notes, adding layers of roasted coffee, toasted cashew and baker's chocolate. This beer represents a special selection of Parabola that was aged for one year in bourbon barrels, then cold infused with dark roast Brazil Oberon coffee grounds from Spearhead Coffee in Paso Robles.”. Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of khaki-tan frothy head. Slow moving bubbles creeping up along the sides of the glass. Decent spotty lacing. Excellent foamy retention. (Sight - 4.00).  1,891 characters"	4.47
3058	Parabajava	Bottle of Parabajava 2015 opened on 1/9/2019; A unicorn was found and did not disappoint! Great MF and very well balanced. Some things just get better with age....	5
3059	Parabajava	Dark body is somewhat thin, but has a heavy feel. Tan ring hangs out as the beer goes down.... Coffee is still pretty rich for being 2 years old. However, the base beer and bourbon barrel really dominate	4.85
3060	Parabajava	06/2014 - espresso, cocoa, wee toffee aromas; mild hops, coffee, more chocolate, roasted malty all over the palate; the finish is pretty astringent and the mouthfeel is thinner than I'd like.	4.42
3061	Parabajava	Parabajava 2016 has, quite sadly, fallen off very badly. Friends and I opened a 2016 side by side with a Parabola 2018... and, surprisingly, the Parabola was the superior of the two. The Parabajava had very little coffee left to brag of, unfortunately - mostly just a lingering acidic taste with a strange umami and vegetal taste. I was tremendously disappointed, after having traded for this bottle.. I'm still a very big fan of Firestone Walker beers and do not blame them for a moment. Some beers age well, and others do not. I surely hope that we see a fresh release of this beer some time in the near future for a more favorable review. Fingers crossed.	3.99
3062	Parabajava	"**
04/21/18. 2016 vintage on tap at Isaac Newton's. Tasting vs. 2017 Parabola also on tap here.. Look: dark black, small light brown head. Fades quickly, poor retention.
Aroma: coffee stands out compared to parabola, though not overpowering other stout/whiskey smells.
Taste: smooth fudge, bourbon, JAVA. Vanilla, burnt sugar.
Feel: super smooth, thick body. Goes down so easy for a thick and high abv brew..  639 characters"	4.7
3063	Parabajava	this review comes with an asterisk, which is that i must have had a somewhat off experience with this one, in that there is no way the whole world loves this so much and i found it unremarkable. i have wanted to try this for a long long time and was so stoked to finally get the chance, but i suspect a distributor or an account or even the brewery held on to this keg for way too long, knowing they had something special here and wanting to save it for just the right moment. well, to me it tastes like that moment had long passed by the time this one was flowing, the coffee tastes and smells stale, and it has seemingly broken down some of the body that makes this base beer so monumental. what i can appreciate is what its supposed to be, a rich espresso layer over one of the most flavorful and interesting stouts to ever exist, an unnecessary but fancy layer, a little green peppery now, and a little acidic and thinning, but probably absurdly appealing in its prime. the alcohol is somehow really well hidden, maybe one benefit of its apparent age, cant believe its as strong as it is. some nice dark chocolate and char to this, still plenty of barrel on it too, faint vanilla and tobacco as well, lots happening but wonderful integration at the same time. i enjoyed this still a lot, impossible not to, but in this instance certainly not one of the best beers in the world. i know what it can be though, and i cant wait to try it under more idea conditions... until next time!	4.01
3064	Parabajava	On tap at Kuni Sama. A: Pours dark brown, nearly black with a khaki head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little spotty lacing.. S: Traditional FW barrel nose to start, lots of dark sugar, toffee, smooth bourbon, a little vanilla, roasted malt, a touch of coffee, and faint dark fruit..  787 characters	4.35
3065	Parabajava	"2015 vintage
22oz bottle poured into a teku. A- pours a deep black color with a creamy khaki colored head that has short retention before settling into a ring around the edge. S- fresh espresso on the nose up front, along with caramel & toffee, mocha cream, molasses, fresh ground coffee beans and mocha fudge brownies.  924 characters"	4.6
3066	Parabajava	Acquired via trade. Whale I have been seeking for long time. Did not disappoint.. Pour is deep black with lingering alcohol legs and mocha minimal head.. I don’t get coffee aroma but this is 2016 bottle so I am not surprised. Get light bourbon and little barrel..  599 characters	4.65
3067	Parabajava	Somehow missed reviewing this. 2015 vintage.. Pours a mild fizzy darker head that fades semi quickly, a touch of lacing but long legs, very dark beer but some brown light coming through the thin parts and the pour. Nose is like an aged bourbon barrel stout, lots of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts but softer aged roasted, some roasted coffee but not a ton, roasted earthy coffee, a bit of char, nutty coffee and or beer, caramel toffee and sweet malts, a bit of aged complex soft malts but dark malts, mild vanilla barrel and some sweet bourbon, a little toasted biscuity malts.  1,693 characters	4.11
3068	Parabajava	L - 2016 tell poor. Extremely thin and extremely light for a big stout. Not what I expected. Head is just barely off white, and very frothy and pillowy - very nice here.. S - muted parabola and ZERO coffee. I have nothing else to add.. T - Thankfully there's some coffee here, very strong, dark coffee too. The sweet parabola base balances the bitter coffee elequontly..  645 characters	4.05
3069	Parabajava	A- very dark, looks a bit thinner than other stouts, no real head to speak of.. S-all those usual FW Barrelwork notes at work, caramel, booze, wood and coffee.. T- chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee and wood again but excellently blended, as you would expect from FW.  407 characters	4.41
3070	Parabajava	Pours a dark black with a tan head. Smells of bourbon, toffee, caramel, and vanilla. Tastes of bourbon, oak wood, toffee, caramel, roasted malts, dark roasted coffee, cream, cocoa, and blackstrap molasses. Medium-heavy creamy body with medium-light carbonation. Overall a stellar RIS.	4.49
3071	Parabajava	Big hip-bump to ficklenicholas for this bottle, which arrived recently with 11 friends in the best BIF box I’ve received in a long & distinguished career. A long time want, 22 oz. 2016 bottle split with my wife.. The pour is Parabola black – the coffee beans do not seem to have lightened the brew into a blond barleywine or anything. My wife reports she can smell the coffee from several feet away; the rest of the smell is wild & I hope foreshadows how my tongue will be feeling shortly. Huge coffee, chocolate, vanilla, with the barrel a late, light entry.. I can’t imagine how coffee-forward Parabajava must have been 18 months ago. Even now it’s a java blast to the mouth-skin, but it’s of the smoother variety: less roast, smoothness, integrated tightly into the bourbon barrel, sanding all the rough edges off of both. Bourbon is a long, slow burn mid-palate. Vanilla, slightly scorched wood, soft chocolate & oh, there’s the roast! Not much, but right on the finish. Moderate body & zero alcohol, both of which seem less than likely. Drinkable. Wow. I’m sucking this like it’s coming off of nice teat..  1,267 characters	4.2
3072	Parabajava	2016 Vintage on Draft. FW BEERS always look more like a porter than a stout. I tend to like the base beer more than this variant, but this is nothing to scoff at. A very tasty brew indeed!!	4.34
3073	Parabajava	If you like parabola then you'll like this! Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, viscous, and layered with flavor all the way through! Jet black with a thin tan head! Bravo!	4.75
3074	Parabajava	Dark brown, just a tad darker than milk chocolate. Forms a nice ring of cream colored head around the glass with some lace spots. Aroma of balanced malt, fruit, wood and coffee. To be fair, this beer is over a year old and the coffee has most likely fallen off some. Very nice wood and bourbon character. Sweet, boozy and vanilla tones. Medium to full body but slightly low carbonation and watery, thin finish. Still very good overall thanks to wood and bourbon. I would recommend drinking fresh however as the coffee flavor was fairly subdued.	4.08
3075	Parabajava	Served in a 8oz glass, very mild coffee smell. Prunish choco w a bit of molasses. Not boozy at all. More prunes or dates as it warms up. Easy sipper, I like it. very mild for a 15%, this could sneak up on you very easily.	4.27
3076	Parabajava	Despite the unsavory rumors that had been circulating about this vintage, Parabajava was picture-perfect both in terms of its strengths and its flaws:. Dark chocolate, sweet figs, and jammy dates dominate the initial impression on the nose. The coffee note on this brew reminds me of sniffing cold espresso stains; there's unmistakably a hint of intensity at first, but it doesn't linger long enough to leave a clear impression. Unlike previous iterations of FW's barrel-aged offerings, the bourbon is more of a pleasant accentuation rather than an all-enveloping force majeur.. The nose is well-matched on the palate, with sweet notes of chocolate, figs, and a hint of molasses leading the initial flavor advance. The coffee intervenes forcefully yet briefly toward the end to neutralize some of the sugar overload, before the oaky bourbon steps in to sprinkle the finishing touches..  1,213 characters	4.49
3077	Parabajava	"l: jet black - thick khaki head
s: smooth blend of bourbon and coffee - notes of chocolate and roasted malts
t: right in line with nose - the only coffee BA stout i have had where the taste is actually more smooth than the original beer.
f: again, incredibly smooth and full bodied. i generally feel adding coffee gives BA stouts a thinner mouthfeel but not the case here
o: without a doubt the best coffee BA stout I have ever tasted and among the best beers i have ever had"	4.78
3078	Parabajava	Coffee black with brown edges and a minimal tan swirl that looks like the disappearing wisps on the top of a latte.. Boy this smells really hot, but smooth, with chocolatey roasty malt and vanilla on the nose and coffee coming in stronger in taste. It's probably better fresh, as this was 2015 bottle, but it's still quite hot on the palate, with some oak, cocoa and raisin. Feel is a little sharp, but thick.	3.98
3079	Samuel Adams Utopias	First time seeing it available around here, so “had to” pony up the money for a tiny 1 oz taste. The smell was literally filling the area around the bottle. Nose started like four feet away. Caramel notes, cologne. Color is rich, clear, rusty amber. First sip is boozy, reminds me of cognac, with a solid pitted fruit on the front, caramelly vanilla in back. It looks thin, but it’s actually very viscous and leaves some heavy legs. Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp, cleansing bite from the alcohol. It really is not like what one would think of as a traditional strong ale, but more a spirit / liquor. One ounce leaves one wanting more, but it was a real treat.	5
3080	Samuel Adams Utopias	"I know it looks foolish to do all 5s. But this ""beer"" is off the charts. The taste is more like a (non-carbonated) sherry-cognac with a maple overtone. At 28% alcohol, these brews last for a very long time. My collection goes back 10 years. The 2009, opened for a decade, still tastes great. I just have tiny sips, so I can extend the experience over the years."	5
3081	Samuel Adams Utopias	"Shared 2017 canister.
Fabulous, very complex
aroma.
Caramel, toffee, dates, whisky, prunes, subtle roasted nuts appear in both the aroma and the flavor.
Overall. Lives up to the hype, if not the price."	4.49
3082	Samuel Adams Utopias	8000th review! 8 ounce pour from a 24 ounce bottle; 2017 vintage bottling. Bottle #14819. Pours still, slightly hazy ruby reddish/orange/copper color. No head or lacing, but tons of alcohol legs on the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak char bitterness, and barrel tannin/alcohol spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark fruits, cherry, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, brown bread/crust, licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak spiciness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering barrel tannin and spicy alcohol. Fairly full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV. As expected this is like a cross between beer and all above mentioned spirits. Mind blowing amounts of complexity; and everything is perfectly integrated with all the different barrels. A highly amazing offering, and world class beer for what it was. A truly unique experience.	4.38
3083	Samuel Adams Utopias	The odd beer that smells better than it tastes. No issue as both are excellent. Medium dark color, nice head. Don't overdo this one, drinks more like a liquor than a beer.	4.7
3084	Samuel Adams Utopias	"Pours a clear chestnut color, no carbonation. One of the most amazing aromas I have ever had the privledge of enjoying. Tons of burnt sugar, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, dark brown sugar, nutty. I found myself smelling the small snifter well after the liquid was drank. It didn’t taste nearly as good as it smelled, which was fine. A little goes a long way with this beverage. It is delicious, but I would never buy a bottle. But, if a bar is pouring it, I am all in.. 12/15/18
1 oz pour at Hops Hills, Brooklyn w/ Dave & Adam
4.25 rating"	4.5
3085	Samuel Adams Utopias	Bottle: Poured a clear dark copper color ale. Aroma of oak and liquor with some warming alcohol notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix of caramelized notes with some barrel notes, some oak and light residual sugar notes. The alcohol can be detected but this is in the range that I actually enjoy since it is not burning too much. Quite the experience and very enjoyable overall.	4.4
3086	Samuel Adams Utopias	Drinks like a liquor, notes of whiskey, raisin, nutty, complex has heck. It’s a different flavor each sip with how the different flavors interact. Happy new year!	4.46
3087	Samuel Adams Utopias	2015 Vintage, complete with Utopias glass set. The share to be at!. Deep sienna brown, murky, with no head. A beautiful whiskey toned pour, but with that haze you know you’re still getting a beer.. A huge, potent nose. Dark fruit hits the senses first, very sweet at first. After a fleeting moment, you get a blacksmith’s hammer fist of oak, booze, and tobacco. The hints of peat and charred oak compliment a nose hair burn..  943 characters	4.71
3088	Samuel Adams Utopias	Last beer on the top 250. Super complex beer that makes me question what a beer is. Great way to end the journey with a very sweet booze-bomb. Fruit cake, Carmel smoothness. 2 ounces is perfect.	4.55
3089	Samuel Adams Utopias	Taster courtesy of Toby. Muddy brown color, pours flat. Aroma is very boozy, turpentine. Taste for a brief second, chocolate, raisins, prunes, then obliterated by the alcohol burn. Sip very, very slowly.	4.3
3090	Samuel Adams Utopias	"Look: Amber/chesnut brown with no head. Has no carbonation.
Smell: Sweet sherry, raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, cherries, and port.
Taste: Sweet sherry, raisins, figs, cinnamon, cherries, and port.
Mouthfeel: Full and Complex, but not too boozy.
Overall: An excellent strong ale from Sam Adams."	4.71
3091	Samuel Adams Utopias	From Tercertiempocervezas. Tenth anniversary edition (2012) In Teku glass. Watching Black Mirror 4x02, then playing Life is Strange. With almonds, the aceitunas. Sweet port wine/ cognac notes. Really hot because of the great abv, but with alcohol well hidden in flavor. No foam	4.07
3092	Samuel Adams Utopias	Heaven in a bottle. As pricey as this is, I seek out a bottle with each release. It’s like going to Disneyworld or Vegas, you have to try it at least once.	5
3093	Samuel Adams Utopias	A buddy of mine picked one up about 2 weeks after a bottle shop told me that they had it but couldn't sell it to me yet. So I saved $200 and still got to try it. It tasted more like beer than I was expecting and I have found myself craving it ever since! Almost enough to wish that I had bought the bottle. Almost.	5
3094	Samuel Adams Utopias	"So as you have probably heard this is almost more of a port or sherry than a beer. One of the things unique to the 2017 version is that parts of the blend were aged in Muscat barrels and Aquavit barrels.. 2 oz pour into a stemed taster.
Pours thick and with no carbonation.
Sits in the glass with a bold amber color and hints of ruby red when caught in the light.
Smells warm and sweet with vanillia, wood, and spice aromas with hints of cherries.
The beer hits the mouth slowly spreading across the tongue while the flavor spreads. It's fills the palette with flavor and lingers with some pleasnt heat.
It tastes first of maple which fades into sweet cherries, oak and vanilla with hint of red wine.. I really enjoyed this beer. It is quite pricey, but if you find it in a bar and are looking to try something quite different I recommend you try it."	4.5
3095	Samuel Adams Utopias	I never thought I would get to try this beer. But one fine day a certain beer expert whose initials are SH shared some with me. And man, it is strange stuff for beer. More like a nice brandy. Smooth smooth but little carbonation, nice fruity aroma and deep dark taste is what I recall. I may never have it again, but it was good to have then. Thanks Stan, you da Man!	4.51
3096	Samuel Adams Utopias	"2017 vintage, gifted to me by @mattflippin. An clear amber-brown color. Complex nose with vanilla, cherries, caramel, toffee, whiskey, and faint bready malt. On entry I tasted the bready Munich malt and this wsa quickly accompanied by stone fruit, vanilla, oak, whiskey, and caramel. Ever so slightly tart which melded perfectly with the overall taste. Faint floral
and bitter notes which kept it from becoming too sweet. Of course this was full bodied and sweet but just fantastic for what it is - a unique beer. A great experience."	4.49
3097	Samuel Adams Utopias	Bought this for a friend's 40th birthday party and shared with anyone that knew what Utopias was (about 4 others). As other BAs have said, it's difficult to rate this and/or describe it as it is so far removed from any beer I have ever tried. Poured into a 2 oz shot glass, it is medium brown and leggy like a brandy. Smells like waffles with maple syrup (consensus of everyone in the room, whether drinking this or not) and the taste was like like a hybrid of an Eisbock and a port wine. Warmed all the way down, again more like a brandy or cognac. At 28% alcohol, no carbonation and none expected. Was a unique treat that I'm glad I got to try.	4.5
3098	Samuel Adams Utopias	"Got completely lucky that I was even able to try Utopias, just right place at the right time. Now, trying it would I call it beer? I guess technically. It is certainly memorable because there is nothing like it out there. Unbelievably smooth and rich, sort of like a cognac. So much flavor on the palate it is a lot to take in, and thus the fun is finding a new flavor each sip. Love beers that push the edge of what is out there!
Aging Note- Been trying at different times throughout the year, this is a gift that keeps on giving. Little different each time, still high quality"	4.75
3099	Samuel Adams Utopias	Unfortunately this beer is all hype and not much substance, it lacked flavor tasting like an old beer slightly flat, had a bit of a malty taste to it but overall just didn't wow me. I would rather just drink Boston Ale since it just reminded me of an old version of that Beer.	1.75
3100	Samuel Adams Utopias	More of a cognac than a beer. Pours completely flat, no head. Very harsh on the nose, a little like acetone I'm not really digging the smell. The tongue is a little better, nutty and molasses, leathery, sweet.	3.76
3101	Samuel Adams Utopias	Hard to rate this one. When I first got it, wet opened it soon after and drank some.... and I was a tad disappointed. I knew not to expect a typical beer, and it does drink almost more like a congac, but that wasn't what bothered me. And it was almost three years ago, so it's hard to say now, but I think the alcohol taste overpowered any of the tastes I would later enjoy.. Fast forward almost three years.. It's been sitting in my closet and a friend has never tried it. I take it out and put two glasses. And I love it. It's still strong, and tastes so, but doesn't have as much bite and the flavors are blending well. Sweet, cherry, toffee, leather (stole that from another description, but it somehow works) and delicious. I would get another sometime and age it at least three years, but I'll have to make far more money first.	4.88
3102	Samuel Adams Utopias	Served room temperature, Utopias is clear, tiger-eye brown. The appearance is pretty close to bourbon, with clear legs and no carbonation.. The nose brings a surprising complexity, and none of the earthy, peaty, funky or musty decrepit smells I had expected--I've tasted some really poor attempts at spirit-strength beers from other large breweries that set my expectations pretty low. Utopias scoffs at all that noise, and exhibits welcoming caramel, vanilla, leather and prune at first. Some bourbon and Madeira heat is quick to indicate its strength, followed by wet wood, walnut, musty cherry, and coconut.. Taste starts with sweet, round and smooth caramel and vanilla. Bourbon and Madeira flavors bring some heat, but it is fairly mild, allowing attributes of raisin, cocoa, toffee, cigar skin and smoke to shine. A nice maple aftertaste lingers long after the swallow..  1,214 characters	4.21
3103	Samuel Adams Utopias	"While not quite a beer, utopias is perfection in a glas. Pours a deep ruby tinged deep brown, still beer, HUGE alcohol legs. Nose is boozy toffee, maple, caramel.Taste is insanity. The booze, toffee, and maple run consistent, but every taste brings something different. Figs, cherries, apple skins, prunes are among the ever evolving flavors. The beer is thick and heavy.
overall, my favorite beer ever. EVER."	5
3104	Black Tuesday - Reserve	"Got this one from claaark13 a while back. Cheers!. From a 750 into a snifter
2015 Edition
Imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels. APPEARANCE: Pours out a clear brown and yields a small, loose, bubbly light beige head that quickly vanishes to a bubbly ring. Bistre brown body with no carbonation evident. Ring disappears rather quickly leaving this one looking flat and lifeless until the end..  2,500 characters"	3.73
3105	Black Tuesday - Reserve	2018 release.. A: Pours a very dark, chestnut brown with a half finger of sand-colored, foamy head. Decent retention, receding quickly to a long-standing ring. No lacing.. S: Dark chocolate, vanilla bean, oak, with light roast and cola..  767 characters	4.31
3106	Black Tuesday - Reserve	05/2016 - The nose is super hot, with some dark chocolate, a crap ton of bourbon, and some vanilla; the palate is super boozy, with more bourbon, chocolate, and roast than the original; the finish is way too thin to make this super good. It's fun to try, but one and done for me.	4.14
3107	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Shared from a 750mL, thanks Tom for sharing this.. Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a small brown head that reduces to nothing.. Aromas are boozy but inviting, cocoa and dark chocolate, dark fruits, chocolate liquor. Taste is rich, so much flavor here with fudge, rich chocolate cake, chocolate liquor, boozy dark fruits, finishing lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is rich and thick, low carbonation.	4.5
3108	Black Tuesday - Reserve	2015 bottle poured at a share last night. Beer pours dark brown in color. Not completely opaque. Small mocha head forms and dissipates quickly, probably running from the 20.5% abv (haha). Aromas of caramel, fudge, oak and booze fill my nose. Set the glass on the table a few feet away and I could still smell it. Taste is all of the above....lots of fudge, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oakiness and some definite booze. For 20.5%, I expected some heat, even with a 3 yr old beer. Drinks thicker than it looks. Coated the mouth with vanilla, caramel and booze. Overall, even with the hints of booziness there, this is still relatively smooth. Excellent beer.	4.53
3109	Black Tuesday - Reserve	"A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black topped by a half finger of dense dark tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of boozy bourbon with caramel, vanilla and oak leading the charge. There's also some chocolate and a little coffee in there from the roasted malts along with some slight smoke.
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee with roasted malts, a slight licorice note on top of some caramel, vanilla and oak. Faint smoke plays with some toasted marshmallows and a little coconut. Alcohol is there as well. Slight raisin note can be found here as well. Swallow is more roasted malts, oak, chocolate, raisin, dark cherry, caramel, vanilla, and oak.
M: This beer is big and sticky on the palate with carbonation that is so low it almost isn't there. The beer has a very dry finish due to the huge ABV. Residual sugar is still plentiful though.
O: And the hits just keep coming. The amount of complexity this beer is showing is insane. Great depth and breadth of flavors and well balanced. I'm happy they will be making this again because this is too good to be just a one time thing."	4.75
3110	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Taste is bourbon and nutty. Taste is also a bourbon and nutty with some alcohol aftertaste that is a little thinner that I expected.	4.49
3111	Black Tuesday - Reserve	750ml waxed and capped bottle into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303.. On first examination, this actually looks a little thin. Thin legs and very little head. Nose is robust and very aromatic. Big bourbon notes waft over hints of soy sauce, chocolate, fudge, plum, prune and molasses. Great complexity. Beer opens chocolate, soy sauce, molasses and big, accented, boozy bourbon. Syrupy in the beginning and middle with fudge and dried dark fruit notes. Hot throughout and tobacco notes going down. Body is full with low carbonation. Slick, oily and boozy in the mouth and goes down very hot.. There's great complexity in this beer but the bourbon and booze is just over-the-top at times. Well worth trying but this could still use a year or two and make sure to get at least 4 or 5 friends together for this.	4.29
3112	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Popped this bottle at an epic Omaha, Nebraska bottle share. Poured into a teku. I felt this was a little over hyped. Drinkability was nice for a 21%er... Better than Black Tuesday. Mouthfeel was lacking a bit. Not worth going out of your way for imo.	4.18
3113	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Black in color. No head.. All the flavors of Black Tuesday, but more rounded out and mellow. Tons of bourbon and fudgy chocolate. Rich. Caramel. Very dessert like. Oak and vanilla. A very big beer.. Much better than bt. This one is very drinkable.	4.53
3114	Black Tuesday - Reserve	One of the best Black Tuesday bottles I have ever had. Drank this along side a 2009 Black Tuesday and, while the '09 was a clear winner, the Reserve held it's own very well. Excellent barrel character and flavor with absolutely no heat. Everything you would want out of this beer after reading the description	4.88
3115	Black Tuesday - Reserve	I've only had this once. Liked it more than regular BT, but still had the typical Bruery sweetness and heat. Definitely more complex and interesting that regular though, and overall a tasty beer that's perfect for a big share.	4.27
3116	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Pours black. Smells of Charred oak, vanilla, and a caramel. Tastes amazingly of the bourbon barrels and caramel. very viscous. This is a Barrel aged stout at its finest.	5
3117	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Pours a thick black color with minimal head. Smells of dark chocolate and bourbon. Incredibly smooth taste with chocolate and vanilla and smooth bourbon. Nice thick mouth feel. Unbelievable beer.	4.85
3118	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Big mouthfeel, huge bourbon, chocolate and caramel. Slight alcohol bite but overall unbelievably smooth for 20%. Can't wait to revisit this one in a year. My favorite Bruery stout yet and one of my favorites of all time.	5
3119	Black Tuesday - Reserve	From 750 mL bottle to snifter. A: Jet-black and viscous as hell. Pours like crude oil - no chance of a head under this kind of weight.. S: All the notes of a good barrel-aged stout, just ramped-up...a lot. Wafts of alcohol volatiles push the boozy aromas right to the center of olfactory organs, allowing one to parse every scent. Charred oak, vanilla, cocoa, ripe cherries. Notes of coffee and anise in bitter aspects of the bouquet, caramel and freshly milled whole grain in the sweet. Obviously plenty of booze, smells like a liqueur..  1,622 characters	4.86
3120	Black Tuesday - Reserve	"Jet black pour with a 3/4"" tan head on the top of it, looks gorgeous like a model. So much chocolate smells on this one, vanilla, bourbon.. Taste is so thick, chocolate, bourbon, oak. I'm talking that super deep double German chocolate cake.
Amazingly sticky and hides the alcohol relatively so well. Just so much deep chocolate fudge. Carbonation just right. Smallest amount of coconut, but tons of vanilla and brownie batter/fudge/chocolate.. This is like chocolate rain with a little less 'sweet' type chocolate, this is more of the dark, stronger variety. Can't talk this up enough, this and chocolate rain are the stouts to end all stouts, and I love that its not uber rare 300 bottle count type of stuff. Will bang over and over again, happily."	4.93
3121	Black Tuesday - Reserve	On tap at the Bruery. Poured into a Bruery tulip. They hype is real on this one. Pours pitch black. The smell is great, vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, that Bruery sweetness. The taste mimics the smell. The feel is smooth viscous and my word does it ever hide that 20% alcohol. One of the best out there.	5
3122	Black Tuesday - Reserve	A friend in Hoarders shared this with us. This was super smooth for the ABV. I have had the regular version of this also. I found this just as good if not better.	4.5
3123	Black Tuesday - Reserve	This beer is awesome! Smoother than regular Black Tuesday. Does not taste like 20% whatsoever. The blend is what sets this beer apart though. Rich thick stoutiness with excellent barrel aged flavors. Thanks Bruery!	5
3124	Black Tuesday - Reserve	"This beer was without a doubt one of the best beers the Bruery ever put out.
Bold nose and taste but smooth all around.
So well structured and easy to drink despite it's strength
All the notes you would get off regular Black Tuesday but this isn't as sticky or cloying.
It also has less of a harshness to it I imagine from the extended aging period and the fact that the Bourbon in this beer is so big that it may or may not cover any flaws that might have been in it"	5
3125	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Tried this along side 2015 BC Rare. This is quite similar to the regular version of Black Tuesday, but in my opinion, this beer is extremely hot right now. I would recommend letting it sit for at least a year or two before trying.	4.77
3126	Black Tuesday - Reserve	"look: dark!!!
smell: bourbon, sugar, vanilla, caramel
taste: extremely complex...massive amounts of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate...this is BIG!
feel: extremely boozy(it's 20% afterall), and the carbination is medium...extremely thick and chewy
this is a MAJOR LEAGUE stout..do not operate any heavy machinery while drinking!...easily one of the best stouts i've had and arguably the best beer The Bruery has produced...well worthy of what ever chunk of your cellar you need to part with to get a bottle!"	4.85
3127	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Black Tuesday is an intense stout with massive chocolate and caramel notes. Reserve's barrel character manages to bring balance to this monster of an ale.	4.87
3128	Black Tuesday - Reserve	Really incredible beer. Starts with all the characteristics of regular Black Tuesday, but rounds off whatever rough edges there might be in the original. Where the original is a bit too sweet, Reserve pulls back just enough and allows the barrel to shine. Mouthfeel is perfect and chewy. Taste is outstanding and the bourbon/chocolate/vanilla/fudge/barrel characteristics linger in a satisfying way that is reminiscent of a good bourbon more than a good beer.. I was prepared to be let down. I was not let down. Best new beer I had in 2015 for sure, and my favorite from the Bruery thus far. I hope more breweries try this unique multi-barrel approach (both bourbon rather than typical double barrel using different styles), just to see if it yields similar results.	4.86
3129	Framboos	"Priciest beer I've bought to date -- ~$50 in Belgium. Sat on this for about a year awaiting the right occasion, and my friend's bachelor party seemed like a great time to bring it out. Simply put, this is a wonderful lambic that is overflowing with raspberry character. The clean funky-tartness of the base lambic complements the intense raspberry nicely and the drinkability is top-notch, as per usual with 3 Fonteinen. Reminded me a lot of Allagash's Coolship Red, which is a more reasonably priced and (relatively) easily available alternative.. 90/100
cr"	4.5
3130	Framboos	I drank 3 Fonteinen Framboos a raspberry Lambic imported from Belgium, ABV 5.30%, in my backyard. It was truly delicious as well as thirst quenching (hot here), and my wife and my daughter who tasted it as well agrees with me. Lambic connoisseurs will love it and so will everyone else. This might be the best Lambic I've ever had.. Look: red and pink murky with an 2-3 inch thick light pink head. Aroma: tart raspberry.  712 characters	4.96
3131	Framboos	2014 vintage; drank 6/22/19 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Very raspberry forward, especially in the nose but also on the tongue; honeyed wheat & a pleasant tartness as well. I prefer just the straight up geueze, but as far as fruited varieties go, this is way up there. Hopefully I'll get to try another someday...	4.34
3132	Framboos	"2019-05-29
On the train from Bruges to Brussels. 750 poured in a 3 Fonteinen glass. Bottled 17/01/18.. Pours amber, big head. Smell is raspberry and tart.. Taste is raspberry, tart, maybe lemon..  245 characters"	4.69
3133	Framboos	This pours a light pink (think the color of a rose wine) with a light pink head. The smell is tart raspberries with a slight barnyard funk. Overall, the nose matches the taste as this is sharp and tart with a slight amount of raspberry sweetness to balance it all out. Additionally, there is a slight barnyard funk that you'd expect in a lambic. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Overall, a great example of the style.	4.53
3134	Framboos	"Huge thank to BeerThursdays for this
750 ml bottle, dated 6/18/2014, poured into a flute. A- A murky/hazy burnt red with a very small pink head.. S- Wow, you can smell the raspberries the second the cork is pulled, sour raspberries, some sweet raspberries, mild funk and oak. Smells like a wonderful pie made with great fresh raspberries..  584 characters"	4.68
3135	Framboos	Foggy burnt red with a soft burnt white collar.. Smell is a perfectly excellent expression of seedy raspberry with hints of sticky sweetness and light funkiness.. Taste is a little funkier with a lightly sharp raspberry sourness accented by hints of Sweet Tarts and Spree. It's a bit less impressive on the palate than I expected, with a crisp froth and a paper dry finish.	4.27
3136	Framboos	Hazy reddish, rust color with a bit of pinkish foam. Aroma has fresh raspberry with pits, raspberry preserve juice and some lambic funk. Taste is sour, dry, fruity, astringent with berry pit bitterness on the finish. Medium minus body with medium carbonation. Really fruit forward, tart, easy drinking.	4.6
3137	Framboos	different label than the one pictured here, the double label, looks nice, lighter pink than expected and lighter in color than hommage, 2018 vintage. short head, nice clarity, and a ton of fruit in the nose. i think the cherry in the hommage adds more than it immediately gets credit for, as this seems in some ways one dimensional, not a critique necessarily, as its really pure and ripe and beautiful raspberry, but there is less complexity there. the fermentation profile is awesome, a little younger lambic base, but its perfect with the fruit, its cool to still be able to taste and appreciate the grain in this, lots of oak, rose wine and flowers, lemons and minerals, i think it tastes slightly less dramatic than it smells. a little sulfur and then the fruit, red wine, and lots of oak, mature but cleaner than some of their others i have had, maybe because its so new, but its tidy and fast to finish, even with all the raspberries. their base lambic always stands out to me as one of the best, and the fruit really works well here. id like to try this a little more bottle aged, but i sure did enjoy this one. nice with chocolate and cakey dessert...	4.31
3138	Framboos	2017/18 bottle.. Pours a deep, lush red with very little foam.. Smell is robustly tart with big washings of ripe raspberries, blackberries and some lemon..  1,107 characters	4.8
3139	Framboos	2014 bottle, pours near still, no head, some tiny bubbling. Aroma is raspberry, funk. Taste:. Heavy on the raspberry, funky, lactic sourness, yogurt. Lighter body, faintest hint of carbonation. And I still loved it.	4.62
3140	Framboos	Bottle from 3 Fonteinen tasting room. Amazing amazing beer. Mild sweetness from the raspberries with and intense acidic quality to the beer. The barnyard wet leather comes through at the end. Well worth seeking out.	4.77
3141	Framboos	2014 bottle poured into a bulb. Beautiful color...deep ruby red. Smells of funky raspberry jam. Taste isn’t as expected as I was expecting more fruit. There’s fruit there just not as jammy as I had hoped. Still outstanding though. Feel is nice. What you’d expect for this style. Overall, excellent beer. So happy I got to try. Thanks Ray for sharing.	4.46
3142	Framboos	A: Pour’s a merlot, ruby rose color with some transparency. The head is minimal with absent retention, and lacing. S: Raspberry jolly rancher with sour patch kid elements: An abundance of raspberries with some cherries and assorted berries popping out. Juicy, sugary sweetness with subtle acidity/funk. T: Bright, crisp, rich berries and fruit with lactic funk, and a tad bit musty. Notes touch upon citrus, lemon, a little bit of vinegar, some vinous like components, and an oaky inclusion.  769 characters	4.45
3143	Framboos	750ml bottle dated 06/2014. This wasn't totally flat, there was a tiny bot of fizz. Dark pink color. Aroma was great, lots of raspberry and lambic. The flavor was alright, it was slightly sour, raspberries but honestly I was expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. This was a good framboise but I preferred Hommage.	3.96
3144	Framboos	Poured at pretty close to fridge temp. Look is ruby red with slight transparency. Nose is deep and complex. Raspberries, sweet candy. Taste is WOW. So fruit forward. Almost like straight squeezed juice. No alcohol presence. Dry and sticky, with tart raspberries. Good level of sourness. Overall, this was amazing.	4.42
3145	Framboos	Thanks to james for bringing this to March Madness. Twas the first and only time I've ever had it. I always dig the appearance on beers with so much fruit that they turn this mixture of purple, pink and red. Sweet. Head can't be retained so don't try to explain it. Aroma of sourness and what is that, raspberry & strawberry?. Taste, ok definitely raspberry. Typical 3F sourness on this one, it is big time, slight rubberiness to it. Carbonation was just fine I thought. Its a good beer. Is it worth tracking down and paying out the nose for? Prolly not, especially with the Cuvee Rene series all over the place for the most part. If you're strictly going after raspberry, I would stick with FFAC, Cantillon de Gambrinus, Friek etc. . . more bang for your buck.	4
3146	Framboos	"2014 belgian bottle drank out of my SP stem on 7/27/17. L-no carbonation hardly at all, pretty dense and syrupy which is shocking, ruby red
S/T - funky and acidic, berry strong but somewhat subtle too. Not overpowering and probably a little less than i would have liked.
F-kind of heavy and a little acidic
Overall - I hate saying that I think this beer is overrated because it was really great. I was super hyped for it after being blown away by hommage, so it was sort of a let down. Maybe I need to chase 2011. Still a great lambic"	4.39
3147	Framboos	2014 vintage, poured into a taster. Tons of raspberries, some oak, a nice bit of funk. Jammy mouthfeel that sets it apart from other raspberry lambics.	4.68
3148	Framboos	Cloudy, crimson pour. Wonderful fruit nose. Very tart and vinegary on the palate with a fantastic fruit presence. Lightly carbonated and dry on the finish.	4.5
3149	Framboos	2014 vintage. Its well known that this vintage is practically flat and that was a problem for me. This is still an excellent beer. It has a dry raspberry flavor, mostly skin and seed, red wine, hay, bandaid, lemon, funk, and vinegar with a light mouth feel and dry finish. The aroma and flavors are strong and well balanced, but this leans toward the dry, musty, complex flavors rather than blasting you with raspberries. That's a good thing by the way. The raspberries don't get lost at all. Glad I was able to try this, but for the price I don't see myself reaching for this again.	4.19
3150	Framboos	Had the 2014 Framboos the other night. Poured with light carbonation. Nice red color, the smell is fantastic, straight raspberry coming through on the nose. Very nice taste and smooth. Top pour was super bright red, bottom pour was more hazy. Great beer, nice to finally try it. Probably the best raspberry sour I've ever had.	4.73
3151	Framboos	Bottle: Poured a hazy red color Lambic with a medium foamy head with light retention and lacing. Aroma of funky barnyard notes with some tart raspberry notes. Taste is a mix of funky barnyard notes with some tart raspberry notes, light vinegary notes are also perceptible with some acidity. Body si full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Really enjoyable but maybe not as much balance as I was expecting from this brewery.	4.14
3152	Framboos	"2014 Vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a 3F ""3"" script tumbler glass. Acquired in a trade.. Not much of a pop on the uncork - pours a cloudy brownish maroon body with little head that speak of - little carbonation on the appearance. No lacing or retention.. On the nose is sour raspberry candy, lots and lots of raspberries with a definite lactic tartness, a light mustyness and acetic vinegar as well. Raspberries take center stage. Smells extremely inviting..  845 characters"	4.56
3153	Framboos	"2014 Vintage.
Beautiful ruby color, no head.
Aroma is raspberry bomb,
Taste is raspberry raspberry raspberry, raspberry jelly with a very well balanced sour finish. Almost candy like."	4.65
3154	Hommage	750ml Bottle at share. Clear, light rose colored, small bubbly head. aroma brings the usual funky brett tones, accented with raspberry and cherry. More fruity, jam-like flavors with a gentle tartness and sweetness.	4.13
3155	Hommage	Lived up to my high expectations. A bright pink color in the glass with a modest white head. Aromas and taste lined up with bright raspberry and cherry bathed in complex funk. There was a mineral quality to the beer that complimented the flavors.	4.43
3156	Hommage	Waited to tick this one for years. Delicious fruit-foward lambic. Not nearly as dry as I was expecting based on other 3f products. Pours a pinkish red with ample, stubborn head for the style. Smells of funk, leading you to expect dryness in taste. Tart but sweet fruit up front. All the berries. Funk to finish but sweetness still prevails. Would gladly drink again; although expected drier.	4.2
3157	Hommage	Look – The cork popped nicely on this. Pours a dirty raspberry color with a nice thick pinkish red head and lots of lacing.. Smell – Sour cherries, raspberries, grassy funk, oak, and a hint of sweetness.. Taste – Sour cherries seem to dominate the taste. I didn’t taste any of the sweetness I detected from the nose. Also a slight hint of vinegar..  531 characters	3.55
3158	Hommage	"2019-04-21
750ml corked and caged bottle. Shared with family.. Pours clear Ruby pink with small head and lots of carbonation. Smell is light, tart, and fruity raspberry-ness.. Taste is super tart. Almost overwhelming at first. Raspberry comes across gradually, increases. Moderate to mild woodiness..  350 characters"	4.46
3159	Hommage	A lot of fresh raspberries, small amount of tart cherries keeps the tartness to manageable levels. A classic blend of lambics and fruit from one of the world's most revered brewers. A must-have!	4.02
3160	Hommage	The beer pours ruby red with a medium pink head that recedes quickly. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, cherries, funk, and cheese. It tastes tart, with raspberries, cherries, cheese, funk, and minerals. Fuller body than most lambic, and on the sweet side. A great fruited Lambic here.	4.52
3161	Hommage	An amazingly brewed raspberry red lambic with smells of musty raspberries and cherries and brett. Tastes of raspberry sweetness hit the palate first followed by sour cherries and brett with subtle oakiness. This particular beer was aged Mar. 22 2018 and drinking it exactly 1 year later on Mar. 22 2019. Very very good but not giving a 5 only because I find Cantillon to be slightly better.	4.85
3162	Hommage	Love this blend. The cherry adds just enough tartness to balance out the sweet raspberries.. Almost as enjoyable to look at as it is to drink. Smells of ripe fruit, feels light and clean. Just wonderful.	4.74
3163	Hommage	Tasted from bottle. Pours a nice dark ruby red with faint pink head. Lots of berries on the aroma. Very crushable. Huge raspberries on the flavor. You do get just a hint of sour cherries. Nice light and effervescent on the mouthfeel. Delicious.	4.93
3164	Hommage	"L: Rich dark red color.
S: Light notes of cherry and strawberry.
T: Strong mix of cherry and raspberries along the way
F: Very fizzy and very sharp.
O: Decent cherry/raspberry mix."	4.51
3165	Hommage	Pink berry juice pour with quick white cap; no retention or lace; no real clarity, just verging on opaque. Nose is sour berries, funky barnyard straw and wt horse blanket. Sour raspberries, funky hay up front; semi sweet base middle; dry tart finish. Light body with medium light carbonation; puckering with some acidity. Complex mix of fruit notes that blend well with a horsey nose; the fruit is vibrant and the tart raspberries shine.	4.7
3166	Hommage	Bright reddish-copper with a thick fuzzy white collar of bubbles.. This is far more sour than the Framboos I had before it, instigating some coughing for a second as it caught me off guard. It's also a bit more complex, but the nearly acetic harshness is a ding against it for me. Oaky tannins and seedy raspberry come with peppery sesame and sweet bing cherry.. The medium body has a crisp fizz and a chewy dry finish.	4.06
3167	Hommage	This is a great Lambic, one of the best I've ever had. It lives up to the hype.. Look: semi-clear dark red with a pink hue with a thin white head. Aroma: strong fruity and very nice aroma dominated by raspberry and cherry.  472 characters	4.56
3168	Hommage	This beers greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: the bursting ripe fruit. It is great in the smell with a bouquet of raspberry, apple, lime, strawberry and peach. The taste it drive the other flavors of hay, mushroom, soil, and wood, but the weakness come in how it continues to dominate into the aftertaste where it promptly turn to vinegar, which is a shame because 3 fonteinen almost never does this. However, you can taste that this was well crafted with a love of good beer, and it shows everywhere else.	4.25
3169	Hommage	Color and complexity on the nose are great, however to Rustic and earthy and not enough part lactic acid for me to really enjoy it. Honestly not worth the hype in my opinion	3.64
3170	Hommage	Pours a deep, dark red coloration with tiny, fizzy, quickly receding head. Intoxicating aroma dominated by ripe raspberries and sour cherries, with a hint of earthy funk. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by ripe raspberry with a hint of sour cherries and a slight, zesty citrus note in there as well. Some barnyard funk with a certain, earthy, musty, woody quality. Starts out with fruity sweetness that turns quite sour and funky in the aftertaste. With an exceptional balance of fruitiness, sweetness ans sourness, this is proof once again that Drie Fountainen is easily a league above Cantillon.	4.64
3171	Hommage	"Drank from a 25.4 fl. oz. corked and caged bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Blend no 10 • season 16|17
Bottling date 12/19/16
Best before 10/26/36
Served in a long stemmed tulip. Review #1425. Gorgeous appearance. The transparent oxblood colored body was topped by an inch-tall, super tight, creamy and frothy, light pink crown that fell to a thick, lasting collar. Drippy streaks of lacing trickled down the glass after each sip..  1,995 characters"	5
3172	Hommage	"Reddish liquid, white/pink head diminishing to a ring.
Nose is very raspberry forward, jam. Woahhh Amazing! I literally can't stop smelling it.
Like a sweet raspberry dessert, a bit of cherry getting in the way.
Mouthfull of fruity tartness, it is awesome, raspberry a lot!
Wow!"	4.8
3173	Hommage	From the bottle into correct glassware at 't Brugs Beertje.. Pours a deep red with soft, fine foam.. Smell is massive, with a pillow of raspberries hoding a few cherries on top. Tart and clean..  463 characters	4.77
3174	Hommage	Poured from bottle at the Brussels Beer Fest. Pours a pinkish color. Nose is sour, funk, and citrus. Taste is sweet, and sour cherries. Somewhat mouth puckering, with lemon. A bit funky for sure. Mouthfeel is medium and sticky. Overall, a really nice beer.	4.21
3175	Hommage	750ml cork and cage bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep ruby color with a small foamy off-white head head that leaves some bubbles behind floating on top. S- smells of freshly pressed raspberries and cherries, along with some barnyard funk elements; dried hay, horse blanket, earth.  644 characters	4.42
3176	Hommage	2015 Vintage. Excellent fruit combo. Right amount of acidity and funk combined with fruit. Really enjoyed this. Didn't seek it for a long time and I don't know why. This up there with a lot of Cantillon fruited stuff and actually might prefer it over some vintages of St. Lam.	4.58
3177	Hommage	2015 vintage, poured into a taster. Raspberry and slightly detectable cherry, balanced nicely with the funk and oak. Slight lean to Framboos '14 on a side-by-side.	4.52
3178	Hommage	2015 Bottle. Pours deep ruby red with a slight pinkish head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is all fruit...straight raspberry and cherry jam. I feel like this should be on a peanut butter sandwich. Taste is all that jam and then some...raspberry and cherry to the face, subtle funk and mild sourness. SUPER balanced. Good carb on this with nice body makes it an easy drinker. Overall, this is one of the best fruited lambics I've ever tasted. Absolutely magnificent.	4.74
3179	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	On tap at other half Rochester , tasting glass. Hazy orange , white Guam ring, some lacings. Aroma is passion fruit.  185 characters	4.53
3180	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	A disproportionately gargantuan blast of tangerines is followed up by notes of mango, raw papaya, grass jelly, and even more sweet citrus. Just a disclaimer, I'm having a really hard time writing this review as I drink because this drinks absurdly smooth and easy. There's a hint of biscuit-y malt toward the back which neatly keeps all the aromas from running amok.. Stupid is as stupid does, or in this case, Mosaic tastes as Mosaic smells. Nice sweet citrus up front, accentuated by huge notes of tropical fruit and just a hint of earthiness. The malt along with the grapefruit rind bitterness once again plays a mediating role as it re-primes your tongue for sip after sip after... oh look, my beer's gone already.. The body on this one is a little more substantial than the beers I've been drinking from North of where this is brewed and far Northwest from where this is brewed; medium-bodied with an almost chewy consistency. Slight creamy initial mouthfeel with no booze burn whatsoever.	4.5
3181	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	2 month old can. An extra from a recent trade. Way passed its prime. Malty mess. Very surprised how fast these fade away. I've had some really great NEIPAs with 3 months on them and never taste this off... Damn shame.	3.46
3182	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	After being politely asked to vacate my Lyft for defecating in my freshly ironed Skidz, I'm dumped curbside in front of the gleaming ray of light known as Other Half Brewing. Waddling in like an elderly penguin entering a Best Western, I catch the attention of a beautiful bartender and order a beer. I take a sip and I’m instantly transported to Gordon Blevins' basement circa 1999. With Crazy Town’s smash hit “Butterfly” blastin' and ol' Blevy by my side, I couldn’t think of a happier time… until now. My Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream has finally come true. Unlike my shorts, this beer is super clean, light bodied and crisp, with no lingering flavors. It's super drinkable—you keep going back for more. Juicy, pithy tropical fruit on the back and peach supporting it nicely in the crack. A very nice DDH DIPA with a bitter bite in the finish. Just another great IPA from a great brewery.. CROWLER™ thanks to myself.	4.62
3183	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	Bottom of can: 2/19/19. Straw golden color with slight amber hues. A fluffly and bubbly white foam keeps it high. Light coverage, displaying sticky lace.. Mosiac hop has to be one of the most diverse hops in every way. The aroma is of sweet tropical fruits, pineapple, citrus and melons. The malt is a light, crispy grain and a smooth creamy style smell, very light and golden aromatics. Big time nose..  1,430 characters	4.51
3184	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	Pours dark yellow. Smells of hops like a typical New England IPA. Solid beer, but reminds me a lot of some of the other IPAs I've already had. I think the addition of lupulin powder adds nuance to the typical hop profile.	4.36
3185	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	Feels, smells, and looks exactly like my favorite NEIPAs. When I drink it though I could be convinced it's a peach IPA which I wasn't sure would be a winner but this is a damn good beer.	4.4

Also slightly strong bitterness continue.

4.25/4.25/3.5/3.25/3.75
Dark yellow and very hazy with heavy lacing.
Smells delightfully hoppy and up my nouveau alley.
Tastes disappointingly thin, especially considering the ABV. Still a good beer, but anemic and almost sour-citric. The aftertaste is fruity, earthy, bitter, and pleasant.
Not worth going out of your way for, but still nice."	3.75
3189	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	these lupulin powder beers are absurd! this is really special beer, easily my favorite of the rash of recent ipa types i have had from other half, and all of them have been great, but this is just on its own level! when i pop the can, it seriously fills the room with mosaic goodness, no mistaking the hop, the intensity is insane, and its everywhere, how the can even contained it seems weird to me, like this had to be ready to jump out of there, its filling the house! not as hazy as the rest of them have been lately, with a nice thick white head on it, a new foam mustache every time i take a pull. the absolute essence of mosaic on display here, through and through, maybe the best expression i have ever known of it, certainly in a long time it is, basic grain profile, enough sweetness to carry in the middle, less so in the finish, the lupulin powder aspect i think cranks the intensity to 11, especially in the nose. the flavor is pineapple, white tea, clementine, and orange tic tac candy, with some lemongrass and honey notes too, i almost feel guilty drinking it, like it is so nice it deserves to be left in one piece or something. so much mosaic, even a little bitterness to help it finish which so few of these have. not heavy to drink at all, even at temperature. id love to try the same recipe with other hops and their respective lupulin powders, this really was a game changer for me. glad i have one more can in the fridge!!!	4.57
3190	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	Mosaic shines incredibly well all over the ale, namely the aromas; the hops work well with lactose on the palate, plus some peach supporting it nicely in back; thick mouthfeel, with juicy, peach qualities lingering.	4.5
3191	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	After an earlier other half beer where the lactose was overpowering I was ready for disappointment. Luckily this is spot on. Malt and hops work well together and that big hop flavour and aroma is well matched with the lactose.	4.53
3192	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	I've been on an Other Half kick recently and it's really kind of all running together.. Smell is honestly kind of bleak, vegetal and hoppy. Some fruity elements that aren't very distinct.. Taste is bold hops, citrus, berries, bitter spice, but still a soft, velvety and juicy mouthfeel with perfect carbonation..  486 characters	4.33
3193	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn.
Milky blonde; onion + blueberry; melon, tangerine, peach cobbler, mango + garlic, and a juicy little comeback; no IBUs, silky yet clean.. 4 4 4.5 4.25 4.5. All the Mosaic. No burn. What OH is all about."	4.33
3194	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	Pours light orange with light head and nice lacing.. Mosaic dominates the aroma. Berry smell like blueberry /blackberry mix. My can is from 7/25 and aroma prob not as it was on canning day.. Taste is solid. The berry taste lingers on the pallet. If u love mosaic this is your beer..  483 characters	4.42

T -- Lots of citrus rind, zest and yeasty bite. Hints of pineapple, mango, herbaceous earthiness, sweet floral.
F -- Crisp, prickly, semi-dry, and mildly astringent. Medium+ mouthfeel, medium+ carb.
O -- The yeast character, similar to what I've found with most of Trillium's DIPAs, overpowers some of the nuances in the flavors and makes it more biting than it would be otherwise. Still displays a nice, dank fruitiness that is unmistakably mosaic. 87/100"	4.32
3199	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	This one pours a slightly hazy dark orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing.. This smells like orange and tangerine, with some grapefruit, blueberry juice, candied pineapple, and guava. There's no malt character at all.. This tastes pretty incredible. I don't even usually like Mosaic dominant beers, but this is so creamy and hoppy, with a light piney bitterness. It's less bitter than the typical OH beer, but it's still got a nice balance, more so than the typical juice bombs..  700 characters	4.71
3200	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	Poured from a 16oz can into a speiglau IPA glass.. Look is a cloudy orange yellow with a billowy white head.. Aroma is deep bitter citrus peel and mango..  300 characters	4.85
3201	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	This beer pours a completely opaque, cloudy golden yellow color with a two finger, foamy, bright white head that eventually fades to a half finger cap that sticks around for the entirety of the beer. There are lots of sticky chunks and spots of lacing left all over the glass.. Smell is like those old school TV episodes of Batman. POW! pineapple BAM! mango WHAM! grapefruit BONK! orange DICKSLAP! peach. An all out hop assault. Dank as fuck.. Taste is the same. All those buzzwords that the old school BA's hate. Dank, juicy and ridiculously crushable for the ABV..  750 characters	4.59
3202	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; production date 01/17/18.
A: Pours a translucent golden (slightly orange) color with a one inch, foamy white head, decent retention, and gorgeous lacing all the way down the glass.
S: Very fruity with a melange of tangerine, pineapple, and peach.
T: Flavors of tangerine, mango and peach hold up well along light roasted malty graininess. Bitterness in excellent balance providing a remarkably tingly yet crisp finish. Felt like there was a party going on in my mouth.
M: Medium bodied with excellent effervescence throughout.
O: Really a treat. I remain impressed at how some producers manage to retain so much of the fruitiness of the Mosaic hops in the final product. Kudos, this one's a winner."	4.77

3204	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Spring 2014 vintage; drank 6/21/14 @ the Yarchives.. Inky midnight black color.. Big dark khaki head with a few swaths of mocha; almost no lace..  488 characters	4.42
3205	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. Thanks Ray for the share.. Pours a deep brown body with a pretty big, frothy brown head that leaves nice retention and lacing.. Aromas are fudgy with lots of cocoa and bourbon. Taste is fudgy as well, chocolate brownies with bourbon syrup, vanilla, and a bit of spiciness on the backend. Medium-heavy body.	4.47
3206	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2015 Vintage, poured into a tulip. Mellow barrel, chocolate, vanilla and almond. A little thin and on the sweet side but still very enjoyable and a considerable step up from the base beer.	4.38
3207	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Large shared bottle.
Smells very good and tastes even better, with a clear but not overdone contribution from the bourbon barrel aging, good balance and complexity.
Sweet full body."	4.18
3208	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I don't think it pours as dark as everyone says. I certainly don't think that light disappears into it like a black hole, and there even seems to be a slight purple/reddish ting around the edges.. The nose is bourbon and dark malts. Sort of like what I wish my wife smelled like after work. Some caramel notes.. Taste is bourbon and dark malts. Sort of like what I wish my wife tasted like after work. A little oaky, touch of cake..  540 characters	4.73
3209	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This beer pours blacker than the midnight sky with a one finger, super fizzy chocolate milkshake colored head. Retention is low and there are sparse chunks of sticky lacing left on the glass.. Smell is very strong bourbon and sweet milk chocolate, along with some caramel, vanilla and oak.. Taste is the same. Starts off with a huge helping of sweet chocolate cake that transitions to the caramel and vanilla mid sip with a bourbon and oak finish. The bourbon flavor is huge, but somehow this beer is in no way boozy..  878 characters	4.67
3210	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I was really looking forward to this one. Pours black with a coffee-and - cream colored head. Huge Bourbon on the nose. Toffee, molasses and a little char in the taste. Been holding on to this for a while, woeth the wait.	4.56
3211	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"""Italy has a certain 'je ne sais quoi' - fab food culture, highly decadent history of art and cool countryside. Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the succer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that's all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft.. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.. (Appearance) Pours a rich, dark chocolate head of a crisp frothy consistency over a jet black, moderately viscous body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and patchy. 4.  2,453 characters"	4.14
3212	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured a thick black almost like oil with very little brown head, Smell is maple, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate with some booze. The flavor is more of the same with a smooth feel. An amazing beer!	4.7
3213	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Absolutely excellent beer. Opened a 2014 vintage that had been properly cellared since purchase. Poured nice and dark. Lighter aroma of oak and bourbon. Flavors had dropped a slight bit, but came together perfectly. Nothing overly prominent, just a delicious mixture of all the flavors. Could drink this all day	4.66
3214	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Evil Twin is a perennial goat for me when it comes to breweries (overpriced, under good), but this is an unqualified winner. Great barrel character. Seek out.	4.5
3215	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This is one of my fav style's of beer and I was very much looking forward to this one after stumbling upon a bottle while looking for something else. I had heard the hype and was excited to try it. I'm not going to say it disappointed me but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Again , not a bad brew but not worth the price point and not up to the talk. Nice aroma and coffee/chocolate are there but kinda weak IMO. Being in Jersey maybe I'm spoiled by Kane's Porters/Stouts - which are clearly superior - but this one didn't do it for me.	4.33
3216	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bomber. Pours black with thin tan head, fades to a ring that lasts. Incredible aroma, vanilla and bourbon and coffee. Bourbon vanilla chocolate shake taste, with some more bourbon. Flavors blend together seamlessly. While boozy, this brew has a ton of flavor, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla finishes it off. Medium slick feel. This one lives up to the hype, well done.	4.6
3217	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This was a fantastic beer. Best enjoyed as a dessert beer after a fine dinner. The hazelnut flavor rings through and walks hand-in-hand with the coffee flavors. Light hints of chocolate in the after taste remind me of nutella. The feel is perfect, it is smooth like a creamy cappuccino. This beer is perfect for rapping up a fine evening.	4.79
3218	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This is another super rich imperial stout. Incredibly thick, black brew with minimal head/carbonation. Smells of bourbon and the wood flavor really comes through more than most RIS. It has this strong coating and chewiness as well. Absolutely spectacular among stiff competition.	5
3219	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Tons of dark chocolate and bourbon in the nose. Also a little vanilla, leather, and faint coffee. The taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate, accompanied by some nice bourbon heat. Unfortunately around mid-palate, there is a noticeable drop-off in the flavor profile. Subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found, but the overall complexity (or lack thereof) keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion. Although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess, it seems to finish a bit thin for the style. I will say I was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character, without feeling boozy or overwhelming. Overall, it's very very good, and I'd happily drink another.	4.33
3220	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Looks like a typical imperial stout. Smell and flavor are both really heavy on the bourbon, hiding most of the biscotti flavor of the original. Definitely a bit thin. All in all a nice barrel flavor but much like the non-BB version I just don't seem to like this beer nearly as much as others.	3.8
3221	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Met expectations almost exactly. Lovely flavors, but a touch artificially sweet. Not much character to it, but it goes deep on that chocolate cake flavor, so it winds up being rather enjoyable. Worth buying if you see it, not really worth seeking out.	4.29
3222	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This was a significant improvement on the base beer. Like the base, it tastes of licorice, raisins, and almonds. Some chocolate comes through as well. Its very rich on the nose and flavor. The base tastes course and artificial to me, but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out. I get a little vanilla from the barrel and I really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer. The bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel. Overall, its a very good beer with a few flaws.	4.18
3223	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours dark with a nice head. Chocolate aroma. Nice chocolate start to a nice light licorice middle to a bourbon finish. Exceptional stout. One of my favorite stout breweries.	4.65
3224	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	22oz bomber poured into two pint glasses. Pours a viscous motor-oil black forming a thin sliver of dense head dark mocha head. The head is finely dotted with thin bubbles, recedes exceedingly slowly, and has excellent retention, leaving moderate lacing. The nose on this beer is bourbon through and through. Chocolate notes are unmistakeable, along with a sweet-biscuit - almost cookie - element that is decidedly unique. The palate follows the nose, opening with boozy bourbon, milk and dark chocolate, and an almost chocolate-chip-cookie-like flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy - not quite on par with the best-of-the-best BB Imp Stouts, but solid. If you had told me that this beer was a slightly more subtle and bourbon barrel aged part of the Southern Tier Blackwater series, I'd hardly be surprised - there's the faintest hint of artificial in the flavoring here: not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very good beer, but enough to be noticed. Ultimately, the various elements of this beer come together to make a very well done Imp Stout. Top of its class? No. Overpriced and overhyped? Without a doubt. But another solid brew from Evil Twin? Most definitely.	4.33
3225	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"This is hands down three or four times better than non barrel aged imperial biscotti break. The bourbon adds a nice complexity that also dulls what I would call the ""fake"" flavors of regular biscotti break."	4.5
3226	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This beer looks appropriately awesome, pouring blacker than any beer ought to and with a gorgeous, chocolate brown head. As for taste and texture, there's nothing wrong with it; it certainly checks off all the boxes of what a BBA stout ought to be, so I can't call it a disappointment by any measure. That said, when you charge $25 a bottle, I expect a little something extra to set itself apart, and I can't say this fits that bill. If this were, say, $16 a bottle, I'd highly recommend it. As it stands, I'd still recommend it, but it's far from a must-have.	4.22
3227	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Look: Semi-vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch mocha-colored head.
Smell: Dark and bittersweet chocolate and dark fruit, Black Forest Cake!
Taste: Good Humor's Original Ice Cream on a Stick (dipped in bourbon!)
Feel: Very good.
Overall: Yes! Yes! Yes! I'll have what I'm having!"	4.45
3228	Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"L: Almost pitch black with great cinnamon brown lacing that lasts.
S: Cinnamon, sugar, bourbon, coffee
T: Coffee, bourbon, roasted malt
F: Solid, not thick, not thin, just right.
O: I'd be happy to find it on the shelf. Solid offering from ET. Nowhere near DBJ though."	4.34
3229	Abrasive Ale	Poured from a pint can into a tulip. The aroma is darker than apricot, lighter than copper or amber. A dark golden hazy masterpiece. A decent one-finger head gives way to a persistent skein of froth and faint lacing.. Aromas of mango, pineapple, peach/nectarine, apricot, white plum, white grape, berry, and lemon/lemongrass, with hints of white pepper and clear alcohol. Just a touch of pine/resin. The brew has a nice complex aroma, but it is somewhat subdued. In other words--good, but it would be nice to have more of it..  1,266 characters	4.44
3230	Abrasive Ale	Dark, golden body with a dense, rocky, frothy head; sticky globs of foam clinging to the inside of the glass. Dank and pungent aroma; pine resin. Huge pine and hop bitterness taste; earthy spices. Heavy body; crisp, dry and prickly on the palate; rather dry on the palate but with some prominent yet balanced sweetness.. This is an eye popping double IPA, crisp and punchy. The IBUs definitely grab you with a hearty hop bitterness. If you want a powerhouse, old school IPA, give this beer a try...	4.32
3231	Abrasive Ale	Picked-up two cans in a shipping trade with Sandis. Have heard of this brewery before, & have always wanted to try. Canned-on date of 11/20/18. My second brew from these guys, after a Furious last night. I liked this a bit better, but also: too malt-forward, a bit of a metallic taste, mild disappointment. Will revise, if second can is an improvement.	4
3232	Abrasive Ale	As many (most?) have noted, the pine is this thing’s piece de resistance. I think that in my hazy craze I’d forgotten how great a good old-fashioned double IPA could be. Ridiculously tasty.	4.36
3233	Abrasive Ale	"Hazy medium Amber.
Prominent tropical aroma.
Taste is amazing bitter grapefruit hoppiness. Malty sweetness is present but definitely in the background.
Mouth feel is slick and a bit sticky.
Carbonation is low.
Alcohol is present but well masked
Top notch IPA!"	4.49
3234	Abrasive Ale	"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter.. Look- Deep gold, hazy, no visible sediment, below average head retention, average lacing.
Smell- Very fragrant, citrus, herbal, slightly dank.
Taste- Citrus, herbal, slightly dank.
Feel- Medium body, slightly below average carbonation, prickly finish."	4.68
3235	Abrasive Ale	Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing CO pint glass. A: Pours slightly hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick spots of lacing.. S: Monster hop aroma, mix of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, and some spicy herbal notes, backed with bready malt and caramel sweetness..  987 characters	4.32
3236	Abrasive Ale	Barely hazy golden beer with a sticky head. The aroma is yeasty, malty, fruity and piney. The taste is sweet, grassy, citrusy and super bitter. Nice medium mouthfeel with great carbonation. Glad to have finally tried this and a welcome break from the many NEIPAs I’ve been drinking.	4.39
3237	Abrasive Ale	Lots of pine in this awesome DIPA. It pours dark amber with a red-like hue. The aroma and flavor profile are dominated by pine and grassy notes. The malt base is awesome and balances the intense bitterness very nicely. Full bodied. 	4.49
3238	Abrasive Ale	Body is just faintly sandy of haze with a large but light off-white foam that dies much quicker than you think to a thin ring leaving some sporadic fuzzy lace.. Smell is a divine and complex hop cocktail coming on like orange liqueur and triple sec, but far more complex and wild, with herbal accents, green yet woody pine and a butterscotch-like malt.. Taste is tangy and deeply complex with stinging hops counteracted by a nice malt presence that simultaneously does not interfere with too much flavor. Plenty of room is left for all sorts of different citrus, evergreen, allium and wild herbs. I even get a hint of mint, and again the malt is a sort of graham-butterscotch deep in the background..  1,009 characters	4.12
3239	Abrasive Ale	"Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped 'CANNED ON DATE' of '10/18/17 08:33'.
Mostly clear, just a little hazy, amber/orange body with bubbly white head which settles to thick cap, moderate lacing.
Aroma of dank piney hops, hint of sweeter tropical hops, quite spicy.
Taste is bitter, dank, pine and citrus hops. Sweeter at the end, and bitter again.
Medium syrupy mouth feel. Totally quaffable. Numbing.
Being a seasonal, this is a beer to look forward to, regardless of its high price. The 2016 brew was a disappointment, and I only bought one 4-pack. This 2017 brew is a return to form from years prior to 2016. Even though a lot of other IPA's have come to market, and the NE IPA craze has become so popular, this 2017 'Abrasive' is still a treat. Great that it is available so soon after canning. Lip smacking good. Drink fresh.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
11/12/2018
2018 Release
On par with best past year releases.
Aroma is a very good balance of dank citrus hops and sweet tropical hops. Distinctive smell to this beer.
Taste is a great combination and balance of bitter, dank piney hops and the sweeter citrus hops.
Mouth filling and dense mouth feel. Bitter, dank, dry, and sweet.
Another year of producing a beer to a level to which one is accustomed. A real treat again this year."	4.59
3240	Abrasive Ale	Tasted from can. Pours a slight hazy orange with white head. Aroma is tropical and citrus fruits with some floral notes. Taste is pretty in your face bitter. Flavors of orange, resin, pine, grapefruit, passion fruit, floral notes. Huge bitter IPA. Very well done.	4.77
3241	Abrasive Ale	I'm sharing a can of this with my bro-in-law over the 4th Holiday. It poured a hazy orangish with no head and no lace. The scent had hints of sweetness and citrus spice. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink for a dipa. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a solid beer.	3.95
3242	Abrasive Ale	Rcvd in trade. Two cans. This was poured into a pint glass and a snifter. There was barely any difference between the two glasses. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Once the head died down, the lacing wove around the glass in a nice speckled sort of fashion. The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to sweet sharp freshly cut pine and it came through in a strong aromatic way allowing a decent sweet maltiness to come out as it warmed. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and added a nice sweet maltiness coating my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there. The normal harshness of an AIPA was there assaulting my tongue very good. Overall, what a great beer all around. Well worthy of having again.	3.99
3243	Abrasive Ale	"A - nice golden amber semi clear color with an off white head that sticks and leaves a nice lacing
S @ big hop resin, ganja, garlic onion in a good way, orange peel, peach; tangerine, papaya, passion fruit, pummelo, melon, overly ripe fruits, background is sweet caramel malt
T # big hop resin, garlic onion in a good way, ganja, orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine
M & medium mouthfeel, alc covered at 9%, aftertaste is orange peel and grapefruit
O $ pretty damn decent beer. A little bit standard for the genre at this point imho. But a good beer. Compares to stone ruination or any other good double ipa."	4.58
3244	Abrasive Ale	Trying this at home now to give it a fair shot. Pours a golden blonde with hints of honey, light haze. Head starts off at a webby 2 fingers, then recedes somewhat quickly to a bubbly ring.. On the aroma, tons of melon. Following with papaya, grapefruit, orange rind, and some onion.. Taste is much better than I remember it. Tons of fruity flavors - I'm guessing amarillo, citra, and galaxy here. Some cantaloupe, watermelon, passion fruit, onion...finishing off with grapefruit and orange, and a harsh astringency. Unfortunately after the first sip it starts to decrease in quality for me and it begins tasting much like onion and astringency. Pure bitterness. That first sip is heavenly though..  1,167 characters	3.77
3245	Abrasive Ale	Poured from a pint can. The beer pours a nice orangish color with a lot of small floaties. The smell is huge citrus with orange and grapefruit. The taste follows with a small malt backbone. Overall a great beer that easy too easy to drink for the ABV.	4.25
3246	Abrasive Ale	"L: Nice orange amber color.
S: Hoppy and malty, grapefruit, tropical. Nice aroma!
T: bitter and tropical, strong malt, ""west coast hops"", some pine. Nice balance actually.
F: Smooth and well hidden abv.
O: A very well-done classic ipa style, more west coasty than the current NE hazy treats, but I can see why this was really well-rated and popular before. Very well recommended if you want the older classic popular dipa!"	4.63
3247	Abrasive Ale	The beer looks golden and clear. It also has a great head that last a long time. The smell of the beer is floral and hoppy. The taste of the beer is full and hoppy. Very good taste. The feel of the beer lingers awhile which is great. Overall, I'm glad I found this beer. It is great!	4.43
3248	Abrasive Ale	"16oz, canned 11/15/16; acquired in trade with my friend, Derek
A - tall, frothy ivory head caps a hazy tangerine colored ale
S - phenomenal aroma with tropical juiciness and caramel malt; hints of mango, pineapple, mandarin orange, lemon-lime, and pine
T - very hop forward with bitter tropical notes of lemon-lime, grapefruit, mango, mandarin orange, and pine; light caramel, grain, and a touch of honey add some sweetness
M - medium body, very resinous, finishes pungently bitter and dry
O - I've had this one a couple times before (once when it was called 16 Grit) and really enjoyed it. Once again it comes through as a top-notch DIPA."	4.36
3249	Abrasive Ale	"From can.
Beautiful orange / amber color with small head.
Aroma is pineapple, mango, malt, little pine, lemon
Taste is dank, malt sweetness, mango, pine."	4.08
3250	Abrasive Ale	Can dated 10/26/16 into a tumbler glass. Pours hazy bronze with finger of medium density khaki head that had moderate retention and left windshield lacing. Nose is dominated by pine, followed by dank, and subtle citrus. Seems different than a lot of the other reviews, likely due to age. Taste is heavy citrus and pine, traditional 'West side in da house', lots of grapefruit which is fine by me . Plenty of bitterness on the finish, lingers a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and some astringency on the finish that left a very subtle tingling (though guess that could be from the ABV also). Even though it was as fresh as I'd like, I was quite fond of this beer. Can only imagine how great it must be fresh!	4.42
3251	Abrasive Ale	Pours a pretty opaque orange to burnt orange with white foamy head that fades to a ring. Small amount of bubbles rising. No real lacing to mention. The aroma is of tropical fruits, citrus, pine, and a little caramel. Building bitterness, and a slight ammonia-like quality in the flavor, I usually get this from Simcoe....don't know if they use it in this brew? Sweetness mid palate with those tropical fruit and citrus notes. Some slight caramel malt throughout the sip. Above average carbonation, medium full body, and quite dry, through and through. Overall, pretty nice DIPA.	4.19
3252	Abrasive Ale	pours a pale gold with a solid head, lighter than expected. still looks great. smell is hoppy and clean, sweet fruit. the taste is so clean and hoppy, i love it. one of the smoothest dIPAs i've ever had. just amazing stuff, Surly can really rock out a hoppy beer. smooth yet full of hops and slightly boozy. easy to drink and oh so god. definitely worth the price of shipping from MN to NJ	4.68
3253	Abrasive Ale	Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 10/26/16.. A: Pours a hazy, golden, reddish-orange color with a one-inch, foamy, paper white head with short retention. Thin, white, bubbly lacing throughout.. S: Aromas of tropical fruits and citrus. Pineapple, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, guava, and melons. Sweet and caramel malt notes. Milder piney and earthy hop notes as well..  1,178 characters	4.77
3254	Mocha Wednesday	750ml bottle at annual RIS tasting.Absolutely smooth, hint of coffee and lots of chocolate.Black pour with small traces of foam.caramel and boozy notes roond this out. Thick and creamy.	4.26
3255	Mocha Wednesday	Pours a dark and muddy brown with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is mocha, toffee, caramel, coffee and soothing bourbon with a kiss of char. Roasty and toasty malts form a resoundingly steady base. Flavor profile is mocha, toffee, caramel and then a searing slice of bourbon and heat. After the heat subsides, the focus goes back to lightly sugary with a heavy malt base. Malts come by way of roasty and toasty. Sweetness comes from more mocha and chocolate than try to outweigh the lingering bourbon heat. Mouth feel is thick and full with a velvety, heavy creamery texture. Overall, hot and booze with some kisses and glimpses of sweet. Balance may be a strong word here, as it veers pretty far on both sides of the heat vs. sweet spectrum, but it does all net out within each dynamic sip.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.	4.32
3256	Mocha Wednesday	Tasted from 2016 bottle. Pours dark brown with light khaki colored head. Aroma with lots of Caramel and bourbon notes along with cocoa. Very sweet on taste and it hides the ridiculously high ABV extremely well. Brown sugar, molasses, caramel, chocolate and just a hint of coffee. Huge beer that’s very well done.	4.42
3257	Mocha Wednesday	Bottled 11/24/14; drank 2/26/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Opaque brown appearance.. Almost no tan head; almost no lace..  407 characters	3.9
3258	Mocha Wednesday	2015 Bottle. 18.6% ABV.. Dark pour, subtle crimson hue just like the others. Some thin, frothy head bubbles up on the pour, but it’s got a good look and the head dissipates quickly with no lace left behind.. Loads of coffee on the nose with subtle but not unpleasant notes of green pepper. Many more experienced beer drinkers know green pepper to be an oxidation side effect in stouts that have coffee in them. Not abnormal, but not typically preferred. Those subtle hints of oxidation don’t take away from anything, though, with a predominance of espresso, baker’s chocolate, charred oak barrel, and bourbon aromas..  1,087 characters	4.35
3259	Mocha Wednesday	This massive beer has been in my cellar for almost a year. The super high ABV would allow this beast to age for several more years. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A semi-hard pour produced a one finger head that dissipated quickly. The beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearly black beer that is opaque. The has carbonation bubbles pooling in the middle of the beer. Overall a good appearance. With high ABV I did not expect to see a lasting head or lacing.. A very dense rich dark chocolate and espresso aromas are what I initially smell. Additional aromas are bready, vanilla, oak, yeast, dark roasted malts, earth, and raisins.. A very decadent coffee and chocolate flavor with dark roasted malts, earthy, wood, earth, vanilla, raisins, bready and yeast flavors..  1,253 characters	4.69
3260	Mocha Wednesday	It seems like I'm always a day behind when I drink these. Who cares anyway, it's like underwear with the days on them. You honestly telling me you don't just feel like wearing Saturday some Mondays? Anyways, I'm pouring from a 750 ml. 2016 bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and great for the style. Overall, this has probably been my favorite of these so far. But still nothing blowing me out of the water. I guess I'll just keep swimming.	4.24
3261	Mocha Wednesday	Thanks to Chris the local guy for this 750ML bottle. Sampled this previously but never sat down with a full pour & very happy to do so. Split with my wife.. The pour is surprisingly light, a muddly brown rather than abyssian darkness. Head vanishes quickly to nothing. The nose is just as advertised: chocolate, roast, booze, barrel. Meets expectations like rear-ended Ford Pinto.. Mocha Wednesday is boozier than waking up inside a bourbon barrel; now I know how the dwarves felt on the Forest River (well, kind of). Massive hit of alcohol & bourbon in yo face, & my feet feel suddenly further away. Large scale sweetness from the malts, chocolate, roast that’s quieter than the nose would suggest. Underneath the chaos is molasses & something else I could identify if I wasn’t already drunk. Thick, decadent, & would pair well with my wife’s lovely Bailey’s cheesecake. Mmmmm. Love this. Could have taken it solo..  1,241 characters	4.7
3262	Mocha Wednesday	Original black Tuesday is better to me, but this is better than grey Monday. A great tourist beer, as it takes you on a novel taste journey. Really opens up with a bit of temperature.	4.46
3263	Mocha Wednesday	"750ml bottle into tulip. Bottled 3/2/16.. A: Pours a deep dark brown, near black, with raisin color highlights. A finger or two of ruddy brown head foamed up after the pour and quickly fizzed away into a faint bubbly collar. No lace.
S: Rich coffee nose, boozy bourbon, and tons of cinnamon and spice fill the nose. Smells woody, roasted, earthy, spice, and sticky sweet.
T: Huge intense flavors of chocolatey cocoa nibs, rich and bold coffee, and sweet bourbon barrel mix with hints of cinnamon, caramel, vanilla, and a touch of roasted wood and licorice. The finish is full of peppery spice and roasted coffee, and the aftertaste has lingering notes of sticky sweet brown sugar and warming booze.
M: Thick, sweet, sticky, and boozy body, fizzy/prickly carb, and a very sweet and heavy mouthfeel.
O: The coffee and chocolate add a nice depth to the bourbon barrel stout flavors. A couple years of age has rounded off the sharp edges, but this is still a very intense and decadent beer."	4.22
3264	Mocha Wednesday	750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/27/2017. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Mild increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, dark bread, coconut, marshmallow, light licorice/molasses/dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity. A highly enjoyable offering.	4.2
3265	Mocha Wednesday	Giant killer beer that has the amazing aroma of chocolate, bourbon, coffee, oak, vanilla. Very sweet beer with lower carbonation. Tons of chocolate and coffee with strong bourbon. Amazingly this beer hides it's monstrous ABV. There is a little alcohol heat at the end but it is balanced. This is an awesome beer.	4.49
3266	Mocha Wednesday	Cola black with a thin finger of fizzy dark-tan head that's quick to dissipate into a crown.. Big bourbon aroma with cherry, vanilla and a hint of chocolate.. Strong bourbon throughout in the taste with a good amount of alcohol burn. A touch coffee and chocolate on the backend, which do give a mocha impression, as well as a little bitterness, which I attribute more to hops than the additives..  682 characters	4.06
3267	Mocha Wednesday	This actually looks like coffee, except for a webby tan foaminess that quickly dies to next to nothing but a gold chain.. Smell is maple, oak, bourbon, mocha, candied nuts and a hint of dark fruit.. Taste is so strong of alcohol that it leaves only a slim space for flavors of syrupy mocha, candied nuts and sweet bourbon oak..  433 characters	3.69
3268	Mocha Wednesday	2017 vintage (thanks Mike!) . Pours two shade shy of black with lovely ruby highlights when backlit. No head whatsoever on this beer. Nose reveals big ethanol notes (enough to ignite your nose hairs) followed by dark malts. Taste expresses toffee, ethanol and some peppery notes, on a dark malty backbone. Mouthfeel is quite thin with a mild carbonation. This beer is hot!. Overall impressions - young and thin. Let this one sit for a few years.	3.72
3269	Mocha Wednesday	Random preface - Birthday beer. It's a 2016 I've had Cellared for 10 months now but am eager to try it after recently having black tuesday. The aforementioned being an almost transcendent experience slow sipping over several hours. I didn't quite imagine my birthday being as boring as today was when I took a vacation day for tomorrow... but alas I'll make sure it wasn't in vain by facing this monster of a beer.. L - Teku pour. Remarkably lighter than expected. Very thin given the massive beer it is. Head dissipates quickly to all but the outer edges. The lacing runs fast and falls like rubbing alcohol on the sides of the glass.. S - black tuesday. Partially roasted coffee, bourbon and oak. Loads of vanilla. It's incredibly dense and potent smelling. Im getting more raw oak out of this beer than maybe any other I've ever whaffed. The coffee is surprisingly subdued. There's something off though and I'm fighting the urge to believe this may be slightly soured..  1,996 characters	4.05
3270	Mocha Wednesday	Appearance - The beer was a deep murky brown color.. Smell - The nose was light chocolate, but there was also a coffee presence.. Taste - This is a sweet one. At the front, I notice sweet coffee first. Then, sweet bourbon accompanies raisins, figs, and burnt malts. Surprisingly, the beer was not to warm. Not overly cloying, the sweetness continues in the aftertaste..  547 characters	4.59
3271	Mocha Wednesday	This is decieving for a stout. It's more of a dark amber color and has a nice chocolate aroma. Flavor is nice mocha soaked bourbon. Body is thinner than you would expect but this is still pretty delicious.	4.21
3272	Mocha Wednesday	750ml bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a The Bruery tulip glass. Enjoyed on 1.31.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a jet black color, very opaque and thick with a thin tan head that has no retention and yields no lace. The aroma is nice, huge charred barrel character with tons of chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, smooth oak, stone fruits with a lot of hot alcohol as it warms. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, cold pressed coffee, mild acidity and light roast, vanilla bean with smooth and rich bourbon, super chewy oak, light char, lingering stone fruit and very intense alcohol. The mouthfeel is okay, coating, medium body, very active texture which is a bit surprising with a smooth but very warm finish.. Verdict: A decent barrel aged stout from The Bruery but I think I prefer the regular Black Tuesday. The coffee here adds some acidity that just adds to the harshness of the alcohol. Again, with many of The Bruery beers, it's just too massive and too intense that it is tough to handle more than a few ounces.	3.81
3273	Mocha Wednesday	Figured if I was gonna solo a bottle, the least I can do is write a little something. Look: Not the darkest beer ever but pours with a good head and the bottle has one of the more elegantly designed labels imo.. Smell: The smell is true to the name with chocolate and coffee featuring prominently. Smells like an understated mocha.  1,000 characters	4.98
3274	Mocha Wednesday	2016 Vintage.. Poured with quite a bit of sediment(floaties)...this is a dangerous brew, the alcohol is barely noticeable. Delicious brew and very chocolate forward. Only marks down was for the sediment, wasn't expecting as much as there was.	4.51
3275	Mocha Wednesday	2016 offering served in a tulip glass. Sweet Mexican sugary taste up front, w some butterscotch and raisin. Defiinitely oaky backbone, slight bitter taste. Mild expresso taste, w coffee on the nose. Tasted like a piece of fudge melted in your mouth, as you died and went to heaven. Very boozy, watch out.. Day 2- Bitter choco and coffee. Highly recommend killing the bottle on day 1	4.49
3276	Mocha Wednesday	overall the class of the night of the bruery tasting night. a great looking dark pour from the bottle. smells of coffee and chocolate with a little sweet caramel flooding from the glass gets the mouth watering. taste fully follows the nose and does not leave you looking for more. feel is very good with an nice coating left in the mouth.	4.71
3277	Mocha Wednesday	"Pours pretty much the same as Black Tuesday (base beer here) with a jet black thick body and a brown head in the 1/2"" range. Aroma rocks the coffee hard, and then its all bourbon fudge after that.. Taste, decadent, amazing. Thick ass chocolate malt, bourbon heavy notes, plenty of rich coffee. Mild oak. Love the mouthfeel and how it covers up the massive abv relatively speaking. Carbonation on point, some vanilla creeps in as well with the coffee.. I might like this as much as Black Tuesday, but the increase of $10 price wise just because there is coffee is a little befuddling. I mean, its an awesome beer, but I don't understand why the variants are $10 more. . ."	4.54
3278	Mocha Wednesday	"Had this last night at the Bruery Terreux. A 2017, but i have a few bottles that i plan to open at different times in the coming years. This was an opportunity to try it fresh as I've been told the coffee taste tends to drop off the longer a bottle ages.
You have to understand & enjoy Black Tuesday in order to appreciate this beer. Not for the faint of heart, a beer that's best appreciated in a snifter. People have said that it's best served not too cold, but i say pour a healthy amount into your glass right out of the fridge and sip. Different flavors come out as it warms. Who is to say you won't like it cold, cool, warm? You be the judge."	4.55
3279	Gggreennn!	aroma from the pour was a deja-vouz reminiscent of my first Treehouse and brought a 'summer-y' feel to this football sunday.... creamy froth and orange juice.... very nice.	4.71
3280	Gggreennn!	"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
10/08/19
Served in a teku. The cloudy, ultra pale straw yellow liquid was topped by a small, frothy, bright white crown that quickly dropped to a clingy ringlet. Some streaky lacing trickled down the sides of the glass.. The nose contained a really interesting and diverse melding of fruity notes. Like most Tree House beers, honeydew melon seemed to stand out most. Lots of ripe peach as well. Peach candy rings came to mind. Quite sweet but appropriately so for the style. Bit of apricot and passionfruit. Hint of dankness. As the beer warmed, the citrus notes took over. The signature yeastiness found in most of their hoppy beers was also apparent..  1,460 characters"	4.39
3281	Gggreennn!	poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a milky murkey yellow orange with a finger frothy white head. smells of a plethora of tropical fruits with an underlying dank aroma. it’s very much a green nose on this thing. taste is similar with the tropical and dank combination. mouthfeel is slightly less thick than regular green. i feel like this is a recurring theme on the amped up versions of their IPAs. overall i’m a little let down. it’s a really good IPA but it’s not any better than a spot-on batch of green.	4.62
3282	Gggreennn!	16 oz can pours into an oversized wine glass. Canned 10-8, purchased 10-12, consumed 10-25. Pours a glowing hazy yellow-orange with a big off-white head and great lacing. Huge aromas and flavors of citrus, candied tropical fruit, and cotton candy. Just the right balance of hops and malt with almost no bitterness. Not too sweet. The 7.5% abv is nowhere to be found. Delicious.	4.65
3283	Gggreennn!	On tap at the brewery. Has the same beautiful appearance of Green -- opaque muted orange with a fluffy pure white head that lasts forever. Aromas are soft and tropical, while the flavors have more of a leafy bite than regular Green. Fluffy, smooth mouthfeel. 91/100	4.53
3284	Gggreennn!	Tall can from the source ...bottom tells me it was canned 10-8-19. Amazing looking hazed up NEIPA pour, long lasting and frothy cap, leaves a LOAD of all sorts of lacing. World class lacing.. Sweet fruits on the sniff, with melon and lime coming to mind..  426 characters	4.43
3285	Gggreennn!	Pours a very turbid golden hue. No chance of light getting through. Orange and tangerine on the nose. It's got kind of an artificial pez character or at least something artificial. It's dry with some citrus character, but it's got that game over, fatal, acidic hop burn on the finish. Nate, those hops would've been better served in another batch of Green or perhaps Eureka. This is a dud. This has turned Green into an abomination.	3.24
3286	Gggreennn!	Canned 10/08/19, so exactly six days ago.. A: Pours a light creamy orange with two fingers of dense, foamy head. Excellent retention and generous lacing.. S: Tangerine, pineapple, pith, hay. Nicely integrated and decently appealing..  581 characters	4.31
3287	Gggreennn!	16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Same appearance as Green- pulpy golden yellow body, unfiltered and hazy, one finger frothy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell is massive tropical fruit, mildly spicy herbal and floral notes, grapefruit and a bit of resin. It has that richness of regular Green, but the fruitiness is taken up a notch. Flavour follows to an extent- it tastes very much like Green but with a bigger tropical fruit and spicy hop bite to it. It has even more flavour to it than Green, which is kind of crazy considering how multifaceted and delicious Green is. It's a bit less nuanced, being the only drawback of whatever they did to amp up the underlying recipe. Medium bodied, soft and creamy, perfectly carbonated. Another winner from Tree House, but I would be just as happy with regular Green, which is not a bad thing with regards to this particular beer.	4.56
3288	Gggreennn!	Another incredible, outstanding NE style IPA from Tree House. Canned date 7/30/19. Juicy, delicious, hazy, balanced, soft, dank. Just excellent. Pours a great looking very hazy orange-yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and fairly thick spotty lingering lacing. Smells deeply of ripe fruity hops, mainly mango, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, orange, guava, passionfruit and melon. Also malt, vanilla, floral and herbal hops in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the mildly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Perfect amount of dankness. Smooth, sticky, mild, coats the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. One of my top 3 beers from this amazing brewery.	4.49
3289	Gggreennn!	"Canned on 7/30. Poured to TH Glass on 8/6. Was 2 cans per person limit.
A:Light Yellow/Orange. Opaque. Limited clouds and few lacing.
S:Mango, orange and tropical fruite aromas.
T: Felt like a drinking white peach juice. Then
M:VERY smooth and clear. Medium body and low carbo.
O:East to drink. Not sticky and not bitter too much. Nice balanced juicy drink !
Say 7.5% ABV but felt like a session."	4.62
3290	Gggreennn!	Pours an opaque straw yellow with a finger+ of fluffy white head. Aroma has some pineapple and citrus pith upfront with a healthy dose of green melon and cantaloupe. Flavor mirrors the aroma with a heavy emphasis on the melon and cantaloupe notes, finishes a bit sweet. Good mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Overall this is super tasty and has the classic Tree House house character/yeast profile that always expresses to me as melon/cantaloupe.	4.61
3291	Gggreennn!	Nice looking body, perfect milky orange haze. Smells of citrus and some tropical fruit. Drinks similar, with just a touch of rind bitterness. Feel is perfect, big and fluffy. Another killer tree house ipa.	4.73
3292	Gggreennn!	Opaque maize with a tall white froth settling to lumpy uneven islands leaving coral lace.. Aside from being a little sharp and mildly chalky, to my palate, it's better than Very Green and possibly OG Green, but not Very Gggreennn. The added malt and alcohol punch to VGgg seems to balance the extra zip of the hops. Here, it's guava and mango bubblegum with sharp pineapple and eucalyptus, backed by the faintest hint of cracker.. The medium-full body has a soft froth at first, thinning to a finely sharpened carbonation, finishing powder dry.	4.18
3293	Gggreennn!	Poured on draft at the brewery.. Pours an opaque bright yellow gold color with a finger of creamy white head. Excellent retention. Leaves some splotchy lacing.. The aroma brings all the pineapple and grapefruit Tree House had, as well as some key lime pie and oranges. There's some earthy pine on the back..  728 characters	4.7
3294	Gggreennn!	16 oz. can. Very cloudy orange with a pillowy white head. Smells of pineapple and tropical fruit with some orange zest. Tastes much the same. Bright tropical fruit that quickly gives way to hefty orange and orange peel. Back end has tingly orange peel bitterness. It's a little over the top. Medium body. Almost no malt flavor makes it through. Ridiculous, but I'm enjoying it.	3.7
3295	Gggreennn!	A thinner head at first glance and the color of orange juice, very fruity in the nose and first taste, feels soft and smooth on the palate and more drinkable than typical New England IPAs. A good overall drinkable beer from Tree House.	4.75
3296	Gggreennn!	On draft 3/30/19. A- unbiased murkiness unleashes across the body of the treehouse cup. Frothy yellow colors showcase appearance of a can of pineapple juice. The haziness is impeccable.. S- shotgunned pineapple scent with a raw cantaloupe theme. Sticky and forward.  476 characters	4.63
3297	Gggreennn!	I'm going to break with popular sentiment on Gggreennn! Personally, I found the deep earthy flavors off-putting. Unusual, long-lasting flavor that will not have universal appeal, Sorry, purists.	3.52
3298	Gggreennn!	Appearance is a murky hazy yellow - beautiful! An Energetic pour yields a Large head which dissipates to a thin ring.. leaving glass-costing lacing behind. Smell- earthy yeast and grapefruit/citrus zest and rind. Taste is more bitter/hoppy spice than the nose .. pine needles tingle my tongue followed by a wave of grapefruit juice . While aggressive, this is more balanced and less “thick” than regular green, which I appreciate.  546 characters	4.46
3299	Gggreennn!	Canned 3.14.19, poured into a Treehouse Teku glass 3.15.19. “ Magically delicious””. Hazy orange capped by a two finger off creamy white foam cap, active carbonation, sticky lacings.  391 characters	4.63
3300	Gggreennn!	Solid beer. A bit bitter for my liking, but good hop profile and solid taste. Similar to regular green but much stronger. Solid and great if you can snag the rare silent release.	4.5
3301	Gggreennn!	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a custom Sam Adams pint taster; canned on 9/14/18, code SO FRESH AND SO GGGREENNN.
A: Pours a cloudy, light orange color with one inch plus, fluffy white head displaying brief clearing and good retention. Lacing a bit soapy in this glass.
S: Aromas of pineapple, tangerine, fresh biscuit or bread, and mangos with a little white pepper and pine.
T: Fruity and more semi-dry then semi-sweet with palate basically following the nose closely. Bitterness solid and leaning more to cumin than pepper. Definitely a (pleasant) peppery aftertaste.
M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Creamy.
O: This can was brought back from the brewery by a friend (to whom I am grateful). Just delicious. Fruitiness fades a little as it warms, so drink up! Kudos to the brewmaster."	4.75
3302	Gggreennn!	Picked-up four cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton two weeks ago for $4.55 per can. This is my 17th brew from these guys. Drank 1st 3 right out of can, poured last one into glass, which I think improved the taste. Super thick & creamy, never seen a beer like it in a glass. Yummy.	4.5
3303	Gggreennn!	Think I prefer the OG, this one lacked the bitterness to provide the balance the original beer Green has. It's splitting hairs, but somethimes you gotta split hairs.	4.3
3304	Moment Of Clarity	"I really don't get the hype behind this beer. This is big and sweet with a small tan head (even after the hard pour) into my gold TH teku.
Smell is sweet and maple.
Don't get a whole lot of roast or coffee.
Flavor follows with the sweetness. After it warms up I feel like it became a bit more bitter and bakers chocolaty Definitely more dynamic.
I think this is a pretty good beer but not worth any of the hype around a 100 score on BA. I'd much rather drink their IPAs"	3.78
3305	Moment Of Clarity	16oz can, served in a Tree House snifter glass. Pours a dark opaque black body, one finger mocha head, good retention, a bit of lacing. Smell is milk chocolate, thick roast, sweet maple. It's sweet. Not much coffee behind it, but it has a bit of dusky chocolate, like baking chocolate or something similar to that. It's fairly fudgy but not roasty or bitter. Flavour brongs up front maple, milk chocolate, a bit of roast, and more chocolate. It's smooth up front, but has a bit more baker's chocolate, a mild earthy bitterness on the backend. It's very tasty and melds well with the added adjuncts. Full bodied, smooth, creamy and even a bit nutty on the backend. An overall excellent adjunct stout. There is just enough maple and chocolate to satisfy my mildly sweet tooth without being cloying or overwhelmingly sugary. It's delicious and almost ice-cream like.	4.44
3306	Moment Of Clarity	Appearance: Poured jet black and thick with a very rich luscious brown head.. Smell: almost like a chocolate chip cookie. Very rich malted chocolate with tones of maple, and black coffee. Very heavy and quite sweet.. Taste: very sweet and robust with milk chocolate, light maple and black coffee. Each serving its own entity yet coming together forming a desert. Not one adjunct overwhelmed the other. Just perfectly balanced..  671 characters	4.54
3307	Moment Of Clarity	16oz can. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of maple, chocolate, toffee and cream. Sweet chocolate and maple taste with a subtle coffee roastiness.	4.63
3308	Moment Of Clarity	Pours black. Tastes sweet with maple, chocholate and coconut. Well balanced beer and not too bitter like some other well knows stouts. Dark tan head, and a pleasure to drink.	4.68
3309	Moment Of Clarity	oil black with a dark creamy head, looks amazing.. smell is pure chocolate coffee with a slight booze.. taste is full of coffee and chocolate but isn't overly sweet, it has a nice booziness to it. Some maple syrup with slight bourbon to it. Has a nice smokiness to it. Everything together makes this a killer beer, it isn't overly sweet or milky.	4.87
3310	Moment Of Clarity	Silky smooth--you'd think it was a nitro pour, but it wasn't. Big maple flavor throughout, accompanied by chocolate and coffee in support. Almost jet black with a dark tan foamy head. Spectacular consistency from top of the glass to bottom. A true dessert beer, but why not start earlier--in the morning, with a stack of pancakes!	4.59
3311	Moment Of Clarity	16oz tall boy poured into farmstead stemmed bulb.. Canned 07/03/19.. Appearance: Black body with dark brown head that pours several fingers tall with good head retention..  708 characters	4.59
3312	Moment Of Clarity	Canned 07/03/19, it pours pitch black color with a 2+ finger thick solid foamy head that was pack with tiny bubbles, dissipating very, very slowly while leaving outstanding foamy lacing and thick rings as it went down. This had great looks for an imperial stout, so the fact that this is a Milk Stout makes it that much more impressive to me.. Smells of maple syrup up front, followed by caramel or toffee, chocolate like a chocolate milk shake with hot fudge, fresh ground coffee, espresso, piney/earthy notes and a brownie batter sweetness. As it warms the maple syrup gets more intense and the overall aroma shows more depth and chocolate richness. Reminds me of Great Notion Double Stack.. Tastes like the nose with maple syrup up front, followed by dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, toffee, chocolate mousse cake, chocolate milk, fudge, burnt coffee, espresso, brown sugar, mild piney hops, earthy notes, cocoa powder, brownie batter and a general chocolate-y sweetness that doesn't go over-board. Like all Tree House stouts the flavors remain focused and well balanced, allowing the coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup to compliment the roasty stout aspects and blend well with the lactose or whatever was used to make this milk stout so smooth. The feel is perfect as it slides down easy with mild carbonation, a touch of coffee bitterness and lots of chocolate notes that along with the maple syrup hides the ABV perfectly. Top notch for a milk stout.	4.67
3313	Moment Of Clarity	Nose: Maple Syrup, Doughy French Toast, Fresh Cold Brew Coffee. Taste: Sweet Maple Syrup, Cinnamon French Toast, Coffee with Cream, Chocolate Syrup. Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium Body, yet a Heavy Creamy mouthfeel with good Carbonation, Perfect amount of sweetness, a definite breakfast stout	4.11
3314	Moment Of Clarity	Gone are the days of Good Morning; even so, this brew has given me a glimmer of the past despite it being a milk stout. Lots of maple flavor dominates the palate in a way that isn’t over-the-top. Mouthfeel is a bit thin despite it packing a very sweet profile. MOC is a beer that I welcome at all times of the year.	4.69
3315	Moment Of Clarity	Poured gently into a pint glass resulting in a surprisingly prominent head of foam on top of a jet black body. Head retention is more persistent than I personally expected. Nice looking beer.. Nose is fairly heavy on the roasted malt with fudge as a secondary presence.. Roasted malt on the front palate followed by dark chocolate/fudge/cocao as the taste develops. The bitterness is entirely originating from the dark chocolate character. I'm not detecting any hop presence in the taste of this beer. Needless to say, zero alcohol presence in a 7.7% abv milk stout..  794 characters	4.18
3316	Moment Of Clarity	Poured from a 16 oz can into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Beautiful pour... inky black and oily with 1.5 fingers of brownish head. Great ring of lacing.. S: Sweet and chocolatey. Roasted malts, sugars, and cocoa..  544 characters	4.5
3317	Moment Of Clarity	This beer pours out pitch black and forms caramel colored bubbles that disappear as quickly as they generate.. The nose carries maple mixing with coffee and chocolate layers; hugely thick sweetness. This is almost like fresh chocolate chip waffles smothered in warm syrup sitting next to your freshly roasted, hot cup of morning coffee.. The taste follows much in the same way. Thick maple syrup and warm, melted chocolate chips mixing with notes of fresh coffee. Really, once again, reminiscent of chocolate chip waffle or pancakes..  988 characters	4.34
3318	Moment Of Clarity	[IMG] Poured into a 16 oz tulip glass canned on 4/24/19. Pours a very attractive midnight pitch black with a 2 plus finger sticky mocha head that leaves thick waves of lace after each sip, with excellent retention. 4.5. Smell is cocoa nibs, Oreo, toffee, vanilla, and maybe a hint of coffee. 4.5. Taste follows chocolate, Oreo, vanilla, coffee, and maybe some gram cracker. 4.75.  696 characters	4.63
3319	Moment Of Clarity	Can poured into snifter.. Creamy black, opaque, smooth foam cappuccino colored head. Foam sticks around for a while.. Aroma is bittersweet cocoa, sweet and fragrant maple, some roasted coffee makes it way through..  553 characters	4.47
3320	Moment Of Clarity	Pours black and viscous from the can. Dark brown bubbles cascade up, forming a densely packed, rocky, tall, brown colored head. The foam settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer, a thick ring around the edge of the glass, and tons of light brown lace streaking the sides of my glass. Opaque and no visible carbonation.. The nose is maple, coffee, vanilla and some chocolate. It’s a soft aroma. Not too intense, but inviting.. The flavor is maple, coffee, vanilla. Super smooth. No roast and no bitterness, though it does dry out on the finish with some toasty bread, preventing the beer from becoming too sweet..  821 characters	4.44
3321	Moment Of Clarity	My first review after using this site as a resource for many years.. This was my first TH stout after really enjoying their IPAs. A 16 ounce can dated April 24, 2019, and consumed on May 10, 2019. The beer pours jet black with an inch of tan colored head. It's a beautiful beer. On the nose, big coffee and maple notes. It looks and smalls fantastic.. The flavor of the beer, however, falls a bit short for me. It's complex and tasty, to be sure, but it is almost overwhelmingly sweet. Chocolate, maple, and coffee are present, but there's no evidence of roasted malt or any hops. It's a quality product, but it's not my style. I can see why others like it, but if this is the style of Tree House stouts, I will likely stick to their hoppy beers from now on..  1,248 characters	3.85
3322	Moment Of Clarity	"Traded for this beer recently, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/10/19 with ""THE MOMENTS ARE MINE IF I CAN JUST SEIZE THE DAY"" written above it. The name of this beer was a bit of a misnomer as the liquid and taste were anything but clear as this reminded me of something that I'd have in the morning along with pancakes and cereal. If you're looking for a beer to have at the crack of dawn without being overly weak, then you've found your match here!. Nice pour to this as the liquid was chocolatey and silky with a moderate mocha head topping it off. Full of big bubbles, it lasted long enough even though the lacing left behind didn't quite measure up to that. Lots of chocolate and maple in the nose along with a bit of coffee creamer underneath that. Wonderful taste and feel as there was some brown sugar, butterscotch sweetness, honest-to-goodness cream, and a rich roasted undertone that never felt overdone, bitter, or burnt. A bit of dark fruit juice kept this slick as it tied in nicely with the coffee, as the malt was quite recessed on the palate.... Just the right amount of alcohol was in this too as only a bit of warming came over me as I finished this off. Like a morning cup of joe, this was the perfect pick-me-up without even initially coming across as such. So easy to love, this was one of Tree House's best offerings and on par with their more famous IPA's. Get your hands on this for breakfast, dessert, or anything in between!"	4.38
3323	Moment Of Clarity	On tap at the brewery.. Tan head. Dark brown color, black.. Very similar to the other TH stouts. Cocoa powder, chocolate, Hershey’s syrup. This one has a big maple syrup sweetness that I like. I thought I’d like the coconut versions better but they were faint. The maple shows a lot here. Thick and syrupy. Full bodied.	4.41
3324	Moment Of Clarity	L - 2-finger foamy mocha head atop a deep black body.. S - strong maple, milk chocolate, a touch of coffee.. T - follows the nose. Maple syrup, sweet milk chocolate, really good coffee, roast, vanilla, a little dark fruit, molasses. Low bitterness. Moderate-high sweetness. Low booziness..  354 characters	4.41
3325	Moment Of Clarity	Poured into a pint glass via can (dated 3/6/2019). color is mocha brown with caramel foam. smell is medium roast coffee, dark chocolate and maple syrup.  417 characters	4.46
3326	Moment Of Clarity	This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.. This has a moderate dark grade maple aroma to it, with some light creamy coffee, vanilla, and smokey roast.. The maple character is not overdone here - it's there, but doesn't add an overwhelming sweetness at all, which is nice. There's a moderate level of roasty and vanilla-y coffee character, with a healthy roast on the back end to balance any extra sweetness. It's a fudgy stout backbone, too..  632 characters	4.26
3327	Moment Of Clarity	A: opaque; very dark brown in color; 2+ finger dark brown head that receded to a thin cap; very nice lacing;. S: milk chocolate for a moment, then deeply roasted grain - close to coffee;. T: milk chocolate for a moment, the deeply roasted grain with bittersweet chocolate to the finish; mild to moderate bitterness at the end;.  459 characters	4.42
3328	Moment Of Clarity	16oz can. Pours a viscous black color with over an inch of thick dark brown head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of maple, peanut butter cups, coffee and roasted malts. Tastes like maple syrup covered peanut butter cups. Some roasted malts and coffee towards the end along with some earth. Medium to heavy body with a slick mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated. Sweet with a fairly noticeable alcohol heat.	4.06
3329	Scaled Way Up	Bottled 4/8/16; drank 4/21/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Opaque yellow appearance.. Small, noisy white head; strong lace..  348 characters	4.25
3330	Scaled Way Up	"Can from Fort Point.
Pours hazy burnt yellow with nice finger of white head and boozy lacing, smell is candied dank orange peel, hints of orange blossom and ripe stone fruit flesh, taste follows the nose, straight orange juice and peach/apricot nectar with a dank spicy candied orange peel finish that lingers, this beer if full bodied, sticky, and has a spicy/prickly/numbing finish. Sticky candied fruity goodness, yums."	4.38
3331	Scaled Way Up	"Thanks goes out to TheMattJones88 for this brew.. 16oz. Can
Canned On: 01/29/19. Poured into a Trillium glass a very nice cloudy pale yellow/orange color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger plus white head, which also leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a really nice citrus complex (oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerines, peach, apricot), very nice diesel like. The taste is very nice, hoppy, malty, with a really nice citrus complex (oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, apriocot), very nice diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, with a very nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, another very tasty brew from Trillium. Orange Julius! Addictive! MilkShake! Glad I got a chance to try this. Thanks Matt!"	4.84
3332	Scaled Way Up	This one pours a mega hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.. This smells like mango, peach, orange zest, pine resin, and some grassiness. It definitely leaps out of the glass.. This is one of the best Trillium IPAs I've had in a bit now. It's got such a big juicy note with a balancing but minimal bitterness. Fruits noticed included peach, mango, grapefruit, orange, etc. There's no malt character..  589 characters	4.59
3333	Scaled Way Up	L - definitely on the cloudier side of Trillium things. Turbid swamp water with a distinctly brownish milky tint. There was a touch of head at first, but it has since dissipated into a ring of lacing, clinging to the glass.. S - huge aromas. Lights up the entire room as it splashes into my glass. Sticky, resiny, earthy pineapple rind with tingly grapefruit spice. Sweaty onions and dank melon. Hot, humid, tropical.. T - hop saturation. Thick, acidic, yeasty. Somewhat bright grape candy and a floral bite, but the main attraction is pink grapefruit, melon rind, and papaya. Sticky, gritty peach must and pithy tangerine. A light peach halo settles on the hop dust. There's bitterness, but it's not overwhelming. The acidity sucks up any cloying juice, so you end up with mealy, hop-laden deliciousness. Subtle vanilla creamsicle when it's all said and done..  1,286 characters	4.8
3334	Scaled Way Up	"Canned 7 days ago.. L -- Immensely hazy orange body with two fingers off-white head
S -- Pineapple, white grape, peach, passionfruit, orange flesh, honeydew melon, some green onion character
T -- Yellow grapefruit, green earthiness, pineapple, dusty mustiness, unripe mango, papaya, parmesan-like yeasty bite
F -- The most consistent part of Trillium's IPAs is the mouthfeel, for sure. This one has a medium mouthfeel and medium carb, with that classic effervescence of tiny bubbles. The aggressive yeasty (or maybe just hop) bite is a little distracting
O -- Quite good and very in-your-face. Has a little of that cheese-like character that I don't like in Trillium's DIPAs, but it's not too bad. 87/100"	4.33
3335	Scaled Way Up	Pours hazy, yellow gold in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is orange pith, herbal hops, and tangerine. Medium heavy bodied...The body really works for this beer, slightly bitter, with moderate carbonation. Very good beer. Juicy but not overly so. Would get this again.	4.57
3336	Scaled Way Up	04/2016 - This was a delightful mistake; huge fan of the combination of Galaxy, Mosaic, and Nelson to create a balanced juicy yet hoppy bite. Fruit for dayz!	4.6
3337	Scaled Way Up	Canned on 02/09/18, 10:07:39.. Pours an awesome orange color, hardly any head, it dissipates quickly.. The nose is sweet and tropical. Lots of mango, hints of passion fruit , citrus throughout. Not getting any bitterness or booze. Very aromatic..  671 characters	4.36
3338	Scaled Way Up	Thanks for the can Kevin!. A- Tallboy to a small snifter with a murky yellow-orange body and a one finger, frothy cap. Decent head retention as the crown falls to a small ring around the edges. Spotty lacing is seen rarely around the glass.. S- Bright orange juices and juicy citrus fruits (mandarin, tangerine) come out on the front end of the aroma and burst out of the glass. Plenty of other hops to back that with peach, bubble gum, mango, apricot, papaya and dank weedy herbs. Hops hops hops. Bright, clean and fresh..  1,428 characters	4.28
3339	Scaled Way Up	Pours out super hazed pineapple juice like color, thin bright white head recedes quickly, minimal to no lacing. Pretty punchy aromas of grapefruit, lemon, and mango, some pithy and dank green notes as well. On palate is acidic grapefruit and orange juice, pine needles, harsh and almost chalky green herbal quality, hop burn, no real malt to speak of. Mouthfeel is decent but suffers as a result of the chalky and harsh aspects of the flavor profile. Overall this was a decent beer, but not top notch. Had multiple cans and one was compared blind to TH C44 ... no contest at all.	4.2
3340	Scaled Way Up	16oz can dated 2/9/18.. Pours cloudy gold with a moderate head of white. Minimal retention or lacing. Extremely hoppy and pungent in the nose. Quite dank with strong notes of melon, grapefruit, peach, mango, white grape, and pear. Medium bodied with a creamy, almost chalky mouthfeel. An assault of hops on the palate. Grapefruit pith, hard peaches, garlic, and oily weed. Zero malt, quite bitter, and very dry. Finishes with lingering, pithy citrus and some throat warmth.. What a bruiser of a hop- bomb and certainly the hoppiest Trillium I've tried.	4.51
3341	Scaled Way Up	On draft at Trillium-Canton. Appearance is basically orange juice both in color and opaqueness. Tropical fruit and great aromatic aroma. Fruity. Pineapple, mango, peach and juicy. Good mouthfeel with a bit of a dry, mild bitter hop bite at the end. Exceptional.	4.73
3342	Scaled Way Up	Canned about a week ago.. A: Pours a light hazy orange with a finger of bright white, dense head. Very good retention and lacing.. S: Dried potpourri, orange julius and orange pith, hay, and very light grainy malt..  542 characters	4.18
3343	Scaled Way Up	Pours yellow opaque into the glass with a thin head. Light citrus and mango on the nose. Taste is similar without an overpowering hop bitterness. Definitely one worth chasing after.	4.4
3344	Scaled Way Up	"Look: Yellow hazy with small white head. Has low carbonation.
Smell: Kumquat, pineapple, orange, and watermelon.
Taste: Taste follows the nose with Kumquat, pineapple, orange, and watermelon.
Mouthfeel: Light and smooth. No booze.
Overall: An excellent IPA from trillium."	4.71
3345	Scaled Way Up	Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a strong citrus. Taste is also a fairly strong citrus that is very pleasant.	4.49
3346	Scaled Way Up	Giving this one the benefit of the doubt because the bottle was slightly old. But overall still the usual murky fantasticness I've come to expect from Trillium.	4.38
3347	Scaled Way Up	"Big thanks to @my_knew_craft for splitting this one with me!. L: Typical hazy Trillium, but it still glows with a promise of dank flavors.
S: Probably the best-smelling Trillium I've had; onion, mango, juicy, wet hops.
T: Straight-up tropical juice here. Everything I want and more in an IPA.
F: Perfect carb, makes this incredibly refreshing and gives a nice bite to contrast the tropical juice.
O: My ideal IPA, Trillium kills it yet again. I will be heavily searching this one out when it's made again."	4.94
3348	Scaled Way Up	pours a gorgeous murky yellow. smell is big pineapple, orange, and pine, some light peach as well. taste is HUGE and pungent: clementines, pineapples, mangoes, peaches, dank weed and grass, no malt apparent. just the very slightest bit of booze but it balances it. mouthfeel is awesome, killer DIPA fuzz. perfect brew, I know they said it was a one time brew, but this may my favorite double IPA from trillium. please brew it again!! if not, Scaled Up will suffice.... i guess......	4.87
3349	Scaled Way Up	"I was finally able to track this one down… It was definitely not easy as it released a while ago. I knew it would still be amazing as Trillium remains juicy and Dank for months unlike some other New England IPAs that fade in a few weeks
Tons of juicy hops on the nose and the palate!"	4.74
3350	Scaled Way Up	Great beer, it's a shame it was a one time offering by Trillium. But if you're lucky enough to get it definitely try it. Delicious beer. Smells great tastes wonderful, make this again Trillium!	4.65
3351	Scaled Way Up	750 ml bottle was poured into a snifter.. Appearance: A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a hazy golden yellow color with slight vision of tiny bubbles coming up the side of the glass.. Smell: Tropical, citrus, grassy, danky, stone fruit, wheaty, bready, biscuity, and caramel malts..  782 characters	4.66
3352	Scaled Way Up	750 ml bottle. Pours cloudy light orange, big fluffy white head, lasts, tiny bubbly lacing everywhere. Citrusy pineapple aroma jumps out, just wanna keep sniffing this one. Taste bursts with pineapple and mango juiciness, earthy herbal nets round out the taste. Just enough sweet cracker malt sweetness. Thin to medium slick mouthfeel with dry crisp ending. Wow this brew is outstanding!	4.69
3353	Scaled Way Up	A: Another super cloudy beer from Trillium. Hazy kind of dull apricot color with a thin white head.. S: Smells amazing. Lots of candied peach and mango, orange smoothie with just a trace of pale malt.. T: These guys are just so damn good. A fantastic mix of citrus, pale malt and light resin. Tons of pink grapefruit, orange and citrus pulp. Definitely loving this one.	4.59
3354	Permanent Funeral	Bottled 10/4/16; drank 10/22/16 @ the Yarchives.. See-through orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a HUGE eggshell head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lace..  482 characters	3.92
3355	Permanent Funeral	Bottled 6/10/19. Looks great. Slightly cloudy orange gold with a huge frothy head and lots of lacing.. Smells like marmalade and sugar with a bit of grapefruit and sappy pine..  691 characters	3.82
3356	Permanent Funeral	My relationship with 3 Floyds hops has been…tumultuous over the years, so I’ve never bothered to pick this up. Welp, here we are. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife.. The pour is straight Munster orange – no haze, no floaties, no flour, no sediment. The nose is citrus, & I can almost pre-taste the bite in my nostrils. Anticipatory goodness.. Permanent Funeral is a throwback to a gentler time of Casio watches & guitar keyboards. The first otter out of the chute isn’t sugar, but a bracing bitterness baked into a batch of piney citrus. Sharp, slightly swampy, just enough caramel, dry, lemon. The rare IPA nowadays that I’d have a second glass of..  867 characters	4.03
3357	Permanent Funeral	Wow. Another huge thanks to Joe for this, just one of the many incredible beers he's sent over the years. Cheers mang!. Permanent Funeral. A gorgeous and classic looking IPA. Bright burnt orange with an off white cap that won't quit. An eerie clarity, as the shadows of my finger tips look suspended through the amber body, like a hand on the backside of a window from a dimly lit room in a horror film. That froth that was once above leaves a smooth patch on the surface with a blanket of lace on the glass.. The pop of the cap was accompanied by an immensely pungent aroma. Digging in, an orange marmalade dusted in pure can sugar is met with oozing evergreen sap. Toasted white bread crusts and zested tangerine peels represent themselves well, as all of these scents hold true from start to finish..  1,804 characters	4.44
3358	Permanent Funeral	22oz bottled 11/16/18 (17 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp. The beer pours mostly bright orange tinted light amber with sticky off white head. The head recedes to an island and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is major citrus with tangerine, grapefruit, orange and lime all coming through. The taste is more of the same with a semisweet start of candied orange, tangerine, and pine laid over a soft honey malt background. The bitterness really comes out mid-palate on and the finish is mostly dry due to the huge hop oil shellac that coats the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, excellent. Very well made, beautiful, fragrant, delicious DIPA.	4.5
3359	Permanent Funeral	8/1/18: $12 22 oz bottle purchased at Three Floyds Munster, two pours into pint glass. Orange pour, thin white head, heavy carbonation. Strong citrus lemon hops aroma. Very strong dry taste and mouth feel, excellent hops blend, balanced with citrus. Drinks smoother and easier than the strong ABV. Solid mouth feel, bitter, carbonation and dryness holds, Overall excellent offering, worth the trip to Munster!	4.35
3360	Permanent Funeral	5 ounce pour at 3 Floyds in Munster. Nice dark golden orange colour with fruity aroma - grapefruit, hoppy resinous, a little floral. The taste starts more with a sweet malt followed by big citrus notes then pushing into piney flavours. Full bodied mouthfeel to a well balanced finish - pleasant but not over the top bitterness for a 100 IBU beer. Fantastic.	4.34
3361	Permanent Funeral	This is my most favorite beer. It is very smooth with fruity overtone. A beer with a much higher alcohol content and should not be drunk quickly. If you can find this beer anywhere (it's a rarity) enjoy!	4.94
3362	Permanent Funeral	I love a creamy, citrusy IPA and to me this is the premier example. The mouth feel is perfectly creamy and thick with a hoppy, complex nose. It finishes strong all the way through the aftertaste.	4.86
3363	Permanent Funeral	"Now then! This is the real deal. Pours a nice amber/ golden color
Served very cold from a bomber into a curvy pint glass. This beer is where I thought Zombie Dust should have been, given the hypie high ratings. LOTS going on in this glass. Nice hoppy feel- taste- nose. Nice citrusy after -thought. You may need a fork with this one. We’ll done , Triole Floyd!"	4.25
3364	Permanent Funeral	"my first BA reivew. This is the beer I've been yearning for months. Was there a bad crop of hops out there or something? This is really balanced. No medicinal aftertaste that seems to have plagued even my perennial favorites this year. Restored my faith. Maybe God is ok with me loving beer after all. Had my doubts for a while
Have to say the name is odd. I get that Pig Destroyer was involved, but there is nothing ""funeralesque"" about it. Its bright, lots of fruit (tangerine and mango) with just the right amount of malt to balance it out."	4.63
3365	Permanent Funeral	I received this beer from a BIF Lloyd Dobler, thank you. The beer is FAF from the grapevine. The beer is 48 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer has a one finger creamy and airy white head. The color of the beer is SRM 10 a medium amber with copper hues. The clarity of is a touch opaque with a few carbonation bubbles. The head has poor retention and no lacing on the glass.. Tropical, herbal, bready, phenolic, pine, toasted malt, caramel, subtle honey, grapefruit, and floral for the aromas.. The flavors, are tropical, grapefruit, pine, herbal, toasted malt, bread, caramel, subtle honey, floral, and crackers for the flavors..  933 characters	4.48
3366	Permanent Funeral	Thanks to a stalwart BA who gifted this monster to me recently.. 22oz undated bomber poured into a pint glass shows a luminescent, yet clouded, copper-orange body and floats an impressive 2in white, soapy head and leaves plentiful lacing.. Aroma is bitter hops with a citrus touch from orange and grapefruit hints. Under that is a threatening dankness. I wonder whether a hop influence can be so bitter that it pulls the malt base from beneath..  820 characters	4.37
3367	Permanent Funeral	Hazy dark straw appearance with a one finger off white head. Dank, earthy, piny nose that is on the shy side. Maybe as it warms it will get more expressive. Taste mirrors the nose with plenty of earthy, resiny pine along with hints of citrus. Bready malt plays a fairly big role in overall taste. Pleasant bitterness lingers on a long finish. Mouth feel is very creamy. Glad to have finally gotten a hold of this beer - it's darn tasty and deserves its high rating.	4.13
3368	Permanent Funeral	Pouring from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours out slightly hazy, but not New England hazy. It's a golden orange color and forms a half finger of white crown. The smell is dank and juicy with citrus notes. Honey like sweetness coming through as well. The taste comes in with pine at the very beginning but quickly fades into a juicy citrus and then again into the honey like sweetness that it finishes with. Sticky and wet mouthfeel. This is so good, FFF has been doing this good shit for so long.	4.5
3369	Permanent Funeral	wow I can't believe this is at 10.50% really smooth for such a high abv. Very bright, very smooth, good citrus nose on the body. great hop taste. Delicious.	4.65
3370	Permanent Funeral	Bright and citrusy aromas.. Floral and fruity taste.. Creamy feel. Detecable alcohol..  154 characters	4.24
3371	Permanent Funeral	"Poured a hazy dark orange with a dense looking white head.
Smells of citrus, more orange than grapefruit, pineapple, maybe a hint of mango. Catching a good bit of sweet maltiness too. 
Taste follows orange, tropical, a bit piney from the hops that ride a sturdy malt backbone, bitter sweet finish.
Feels full bodied for the style which is definitely an IPA, more likely a double. Very slight alcohol presence. Overall a great beer."	4.44
3372	Permanent Funeral	Tasted from draft. Pours hazy gold with white head. Aroma is citrus and some dank resin. Taste is well balanced with great clean bitter flavor. Flavors of melon and citrus fruit. Excellent beer but I think I like Zombie Dust better.	4.6
3373	Permanent Funeral	"L- Brilliant orange with a large, foamy off-white head with little carbonation.
S- Can smell this from accross the room. HUGE citrus and pine hop with the malt noticeable. Funk as well.
T- Perfect blend of citrus and pine resin and malt. A nice dank bite in which malt continues to go hand and hand.
F- Huge taste with plenty of bitterness, yet all goes down smoothly.
_O- Meets up to the hype."	4.93
3374	Permanent Funeral	22 ounce bomber bottled 5/10/2017 and poured into a 3 Floyds pint glass and consumed on 5/17/2017.. Appearance: Thick half inch white foam head forming spider webs as the head retreats. The beer itself pours a very nice hazy golden orange color.. Nose: Light intensity citrus and pineapple..  587 characters	4.07
3375	Permanent Funeral	Pours a clouded orange with two and a half fingers of off-white head that retains extremely well. Just a little lacing left behind. Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and lemongrass. Extremely hoppy, but well developed. Flavor profile is resin, pine, citrus, lemongrass, and herbal. Lots and lots of hop notes, which include a discernible bitterness. Bready biscuit malts provide some support. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy texture. Overall, a huge DIPA with loads and loads of hop notes. Not close to bitter free, but still well executed.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 22oz bottle.	4.41
3376	Permanent Funeral	Finally got my hands on a bomber. 22oz bottle. Cannot read the date but I am assuming it is relatively fresh as my beer store buddy just got it in today.. Dark orange-1 finger of head. Looks good.. Smell is well...good but weak. Mango, tropical fruits, sweet aromas..  699 characters	3.82
3377	Permanent Funeral	Appearance - Pours deep golden color with nice thick white head. Streaky white lacing down the glass.. Aroma - Just tons of tropical aromas mango, pineapple, orange just a slight hint of alcohol and pine with a touch of sweetness.. Taste - Really great flavors again very tropical fruit forward. Mango, pineapple and grapefruit, a little bitterness on the back end and just the slightest sign of the alcohol..  588 characters	4.88
3378	Permanent Funeral	22 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Cannot read the bottle date.. Pours a sexy orange color that has a little bit of murkiness / haze to it. Cannot see threw the beer too well. Nice frothy two finger white colored head with good retention. Not too much lacing.. Smell isn't very large. I'm picking up mostly citrus and pine notes..  818 characters	4.48
3379	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Bottle at share. Dark brown, oily pour, tiny ring of head. Aromas and taste bring brown sugar, molasses, sweet. Slick and sticky.More roasty malts than coffee.	4.18
3380	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	The last bottle from a beautiful trade with That_Bearded_Guy this summer, which I was saving to pop on our twentieth wedding anniversary. Split with my marvelous wife!. The 750ML bottle has one of those handy tags that rips a hole in the wax big enough to get a bottle opener in, which my oft-punctured fingers appreciate. Silver wax sprays off & we’re into a big, black beer with minimal visible carbonation. The nose is Willy Wonka bar, coffee, & light, warm malts. Nice.. Sump – Barrel Aged Coffee Stout is an odd breed of coffee stout. The coffee shows as roast in the nose & only faintly in the taste, which leans into herbs & dark fruit. Slotting in next is plenty of cocoa, char, lovely shot of whiskey, vanilla creamer, & what tastes like good old Wesley’s Maple Syrup. The Finnish is all NIN bass, dark, driving, tasty. Old school big stout thick (not pastry chef thick), which raises the drinkability level..  1,156 characters	4.35
3381	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	poured into a taster glass via draft at Other Half's Pastry Town (3/16/2019). jet black color with minimal foam. smell is a heavy punch of coffee and bourbon.  305 characters	4.44
3382	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Syrupy, soft, smooth sipper. Like liquid chocolate cake in a glass. Coffee is there, with burnt caramel and dark cocoa. Sweet, minimal carbonation, sweet and velvety. Boozy in a way, but only because you know the alcohol is there - it's hidden, blending with whiskey tones to make one of the best beers I've ever had. The smell is indulgent and dessert-y, intoxicating. Look is midnight black, just like coffee should be.	4.73
3383	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	2019 vintage. Typical black appearance, not much head. Smells great, bourbon barrel, mild coffee. Flavor was great, lots of thick chocolate and bourbon notes. Not a ton of coffee but it was so good that who cares?	4.39
3384	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	2017 Vintage (had with breakfast on a weekend getaway). Pour - heavy and thick like motor oil. Not much lacing and only a thin tan head.. Smell - Amazing coffee aroma. Slight bourbon aroma as well..  523 characters	4.26
3385	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Had on tap. The pour is jet black and emits strong coffee and cream aromas with a burst of rye whiskey booziness at the end. The taste is magnificently focused on the coffee yet pulls in plenty of other rich flavors such as fudge, booze barrel, vanilla, molasses and cinnamon. Can just chew on this beer for hours	4.63
3386	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Smell: Straight Fudge. Big Milk chocolate, dark chocolate. Fresh roasted espresso beans, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, a little pop of dark fruit. This is just a straight chocolate bomb mixed with coffee and barrel. This beer smells like a chocolate paradise.. Taste: Right upfront I get a good amount of dark fruit and dark cherry. Raisin, plum, dark cherry juice. The mid palette the beer just becomes a massive chocolate, coffee, fudge bomb. Melted milk chocolate, rich fudgie brownie batter, dark chocolate covered espresso beans. The finish I get a barrel presence but it isn’t huge. I get a nice vanilla and coconut sweetness with a touch of sweet smooth bourbon and a woody, oaky bitterness to give this beer a balance to counter the sweetness.. Feel: The mouthfeel on this beer is absurd. Full and thick. Chewy, but super Creamy and velvety. This beer coats every inch of your mouth and tongue and never lets go. Just an absolutely perfect mouthfeel..  1,177 characters	5
3387	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Review is for 2018 release of BA Sump.. The pour on this is dark, like motor oil. The syrupy body doesn’t leave much to be remembered , with hardly any residual lace and a very thin head of deep tan foam.. The nose starts with a very strong aroma of dark sweet fruit, swirling with chocolate and finishing with an oakey, tobacco finale..  623 characters	4.37
3388	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Pitch black color. Aroma is essentially coffee with cream in beer form. Taste has sweet malt, bitter coffee, toffee and bourbon.	4.6
3389	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	2018 vintage. Released 2 months ago.. A: Pours a thick black with just a smattering of medium brown head. No lacing and poor retention.. S: Thick, sweet, rich dark cocoa, baker’s spice (cinnamon, clove) infused medium-roast coffee, medium-light bourbon and oak, dry wood, and light prunes..  776 characters	4.49
3390	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Tar black with a dark mocha fizz that disappears quickly leaving a slick, taut black surface.. The aroma is super creamy and fudgey dark chocolate brownie with vanilla bean and mocha, while a fine bourbon oak is smoothly present, yet not overpowering.. Amazing flavors of deep dark chocolate brownie somehow don't come across as too sweet, as rich vanilla accents a very nicely complex charred oak that's simultaneously woody, herbal and spicy. Cocoa dusted prune comes out in the swallow as follow-up sip enhances the dark coffee and measured bourbon presence..  830 characters	4.4
3391	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	"L: Dark chestnut hues with a thin khaki head and ample lacing
S: Tons of oak, fudge, and dark roast
T: Smooth mocha, dark chocolate, and panela notes
F: Thick and chewy - my bottle had some odd clumps in it as well that unfortunately detracted from the experience
O: Elite coffee stout. Odd pour of congealed matter in the bottle but otherwise incredible. Well done."	4.57
3392	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Perennial stemmed wine glass. Thanks Brian for sharing this long-time want.. On the nose I get a lot of vanilla, chocolate, fresh coffee beans, and surprisingly a bit of maple. Smells like an awesome breakfast stout.. Bold, dark chocolate notes, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla-maple coffee, cocoa and bourbon on the follow through. The aftertaste is charred with dark roast coffee flavors lingering for a while. Mouthfeel is good with a medium-heavy body and low carbonation..  655 characters	4.5
3393	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	2017 bottle poured into a tulip. Poured tar black with a mocha frappe head. Smell is of wonderful coffee with barrel character that adds toffee and vanilla. Taste is amazing. Creamy coffee with some bourbon aspects, toffee, vanilla and woodiness. Feel is fantastic. Thick and slick. Coats the mouth. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. One of the best BA coffee stouts I’ve had.	4.75
3394	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	4/22/17 @ MTKATL - Bottle poured into snifter. Thick viscosity, rich dark color. This is full body w/ Coffee on front that blooms on palate at back end. Lovely	4.6
3395	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	"2017
Pours pitch black. Nose is roasty coffee notes with chocolate and bourbon. Taste follows the nose. Rich chocolate, oak, bourbon. Coffee has tamed some on this compared to a fresher bottle consumed earlier this year, but still present, and blended nicely into the beer. Some vanilla noted as it warms. A delicious offering from Perennial, one to seek out.. 2018
Pours pitch black, no head to speak of. Huge barrel notes. Grain alcohol, chocolate, Oak, bourbon. Taste is bakers Chocolate, huge bourbon/Rye notes, smoke. Coffee comes through mid-palate. This beer is soaked with whiskey, very complex barrel notes. Full bodied, thick mouthfeel. Overall, incredible beer. If you like a lot of barrel character this is next level. So impressive."	4.68
3396	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Pitch black and nearly opaque with dark chocolate brown edges and a two finger mocha head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic spotty lace left behind.. Sweet, slightly boozy aroma with a very nice delicate bourbon barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the coffee/roasted malts of the base beer. Bourbon sweetness that's slightly spicy with subtle charred oak but not much toothpick. Really nice bourbon and gourmet coffee interplay along with silky vanilla bean and toasted coconut. Underneath, there's really nice gourmet coffee character along with some toast, oatmeal and dark chocolate. Luscious silky chocolate sweetness balancing out the barrel and roast.. Very similar to the nose with an excellent bourbon barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the gourmet coffee, subtle roast and silky chocolate sweetness of the base beer. Slightly spicy and boozy but mostly smooth bourbon flavor along with toasted oak, faint char, coconut and vanilla bean. Barrel notes countered by deeply roasted gourmet coffee but not overly harsh, acrid or astringent. Slightly green peppery but overall excellent coffee flavor that doesn't get lost under the barrel notes. Luscious, silky chocolate dessert sweetness balances things out. Hints of bakers chocolate, gooey fudge and triple chocolate layer cake. Well balanced with complex barrel flavors excellently integrated into the robust roast, sweeter dark malt notes and intense coffee presence. Great beer.	4.39
3397	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Absolutely delicious beer that I would love to have again. Poured thick and black with coffee brownie aromas. Flavors backed up the aroma perfectly. Drank thick with awesome coffee and chocolate flavors	4.84
3398	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Pours dark black with a small tan head. Smells of dark roasted coffee predominate. Tastes of bitter coffee up front followed by a almost sweet cherry from the barrels. Excellent	4.6
3399	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	"Remember that Guitar Hero commercial from way back when with Heidi Klum wearing nothing but a white button up shirt and socks, jamming out like nobody's watching to Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock and Roll"" holding a Guitar Hero controller?. Well that was pretty much me after taking one sip of BA Sump.. I don't know if it's because I hadn't had beer in a while, or because this particular drinking session happened after three-four weeks worth of very stressful life events, but for some reason I felt a sudden rush of incredible euphoria the exact moment the precious black liquid passed between my lips and my neurotransmitters started firing back signals trying to decode the wonderment beckoning my palatal and olfactory senses -- I guess this is why I'm still obsessed with a hobby that's detrimental to both my health and bank account; which gifts me with nothing but splitting headaches and cottonmouth in the mornings while stealing my gains at the gym..  3,081 characters"	4.99
3400	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	2017 vintage drank on 7/8/17. this beer is the real deal and not overrated in any way. It's about 6 months old and drinking incredible. The coffee presence is fantastic and some age would not necessarily hurt this either. It was a pitch black and thick and creamy beer that came fully loaded with the flavors. The barrel is perfectly present. Nothing too complex, but by far one of the best coffee ba stouts out there. Elite!	4.75
3401	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	2017 Vintage, poured into a tulip. Velvety coffee balanced well with chocolate notes and roasted malts. Super thick mouthfeel, which makes this one elite.	4.76
3402	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	rye barrel aged sump, on tap no less! a real special brew that i have been looking forward to trying for ages now, and only am just getting my first crack. its inky slick black from the tap, highly viscous, shiny, and relatively still after a moment. pretty shine, brimming with black coffee in the aroma. to me, this isnt espresso or cold brew or anything, but distinctly black coffee, almost oozy strong. the nose also shows the spicy sweet rye, with vanilla from the oak and the slight harshness of the whiskey itself, some fusel alcohol, and a wonderful thick black barley malt base that i remember from the original, this barrel aged version has been transformed but not compromised. i love the coffee in the flavor, it has some acidity which i like with all this body, but it has a simple nature to it, quality beans brewed well, but seems less fancy than other coffee beers, just lots and lots of it. the barrel is strong, this is both woody and boozy, and also obviously rye and not bourbon whiskey, less corny and sweet, more character from the grain than that, and the oak with the coffee and the charred grain makes this mighty complex and delicious. its almost too thick and strong to drink a lot of, i find myself lipping it slowly, taking in no more than an ounce or two at a time, savoring it before swallowing it, and almost needing to recover a moment before going back in for more. its special and unique, but man is it sturdy and strong, not for everyone i wouldnt think, and a somewhat more bold and assertive stout than many others in its field. tastes and feels more like 15% abv! loved it, but this one is for sharing! now if i could only find some barrel aged abraxas i would feel like i have the highest perennial beers on lock! this was delightfully enormous.	4.46
3403	Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout	Pours jet black with a touch of mocha head. Nose has big barrel notes up front followed by espresso and dark chocolate. As it warms, you can pick up more roast and some dark fruit elements. Taste is not as coffee forward as regular sump....the age and the barrel has taken away some of the familiar taste. The barrel, chocolate, roast, and coffee are very well balanced. Feel is thick and velvety with moderately low carbonation. Overall, an excellent example of a BA coffee stout but just a tick below BCBCS and some of Perennial's other BA stout offerings.	4.61
3404	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Jet black color, more thick viscosity, tan clumpy head that is champ of retention and stickiness. Aroma was plenty of whiskey, soft charred roast, chocolate malt. Leather and oak show up like its a tree sex party.. Taste is so chewy, absorbs the alcohol for you, whiskey is in a supporting role. Faint honey and vanilla. Caramel present like a boozy cracker jack, mouthfeel amazing that in a SRM this deep, it allows toffee and caramel to come through even through the whiskey and smoke. Amazing stuff, amazing circumstance, I kind of hate that I liked it so much.	4.69
3405	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	A big thanks to Dan for this one. Served in a snifter. Reviewed from notes 10/7/14. Pours minimal head. Beer is pitch black and opaque. Lacing is spotty and sparse but the legs are slick, oily, and coat the glass nicely.. Aroma is a roasted malt, smoke, chocolate, sweet soy sauce, prunes and peat. Robust and very unique..  850 characters	4.09
3406	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	25 cLass bottle poured into a wine taster. 2006 bottle.. Appearance - Viscous black. Small khaki head. Very thin collar.. Smell - Wow. Very oaky. Deep dark chocolate. Roasty coffee. A little bit of smoke. A green woody aroma. Almost like cedar..  590 characters	4.69
3407	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	"I don't review often. But when I do, it's Alexandria Whaelz. HUGE thanks to Bill A for sharing this. Drank along side the non barreled version. Bottle from 2007.. A - Very dark brown, bordering on completely black. Medium tan head that lingers for awhile. I should have used a different glass, I'm an idiot.. S - Not a ton going on here. A good amount of roast, some oaky vanilla notes that come in secondary. As the bottle warmed up, I got the ""Burgundy pepper"" as described below..  1,343 characters"	4.59
3408	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	2007 bottle, generously shared by Sean9869, thanks for letting me try a super long time want.. The beer pours a dark cola brown, nearly black color with swirls of brown, caramel and hazelnut before it all melds together with a slight head that recedes quickly and leaves spots of lace. The aroma is wonderful, wood, char, light chocolate, slightly roasted coffee and toasted grain, sweet alcohol, pitted stone fruit, toffee, molasses, every time I took a sniff, I felt like there was something new, exceedingly complex. The beer really shined on the tongue, bakers chocolate, stone fruit, coffee, barrel character, toffee, mollasses, marshmallow, alcohol and then some, just like the nose, each sip brought out something new and something exciting. The balance is spectacular, the complexity is unending, and the smoothness is hardly matched. The body was great, coats the mouth well, super smooth, rich, decadent without being taxing or too thick.. Verdict: Magnificent, easily the most complex and rewarding RIS I've tried to date and the wood only complimented this further. One of the few beers that has really lived up to the crazy hype, and even exceeded it. Well done Närke.	4.69
3409	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	"This was a long time want, generously shared by Shyne. 2009 vintage. Drunk in May 2012 to get warmed before the epic Sour&Bitter festival. Reviewed from notes.
A: Pours black, dark with faint brown glints. There is a small brown head which settles into a thin collar.
S: The smell is woody, oaky, on vanilla, bourbon and chocolate. Rich and gourmet scene.
T: The taste follows the nose with loads of dark chocolate and vanilla upfront. Next sips bring more roasted and toasted malts, with slightly burnt and toasted bread. A bit boozy on the aftertaste, but nothing disturbing.
M: Mouthfeel is sweet, oily, very smooth.
O: Very smooth and sweet, deep. I would land this again with great pleasure!"	4.77
3410	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	2008 Vintage. Appearance: Inky black pour with a minimal khaki crown that show little retention or lace.. Smell: Lightly charred oak, grainy roast malt, a hint of black strap molasses, faint cocoa powder notes, and a touch of floral heather..  621 characters	4.56
3411	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	07 bottle. Pour is dark brown, almost black with red edges and a tiny bit of tan large bubbled head. Nose is nice, same rich chocolate cake as stormaktsporter, maybe more, and hints of bourbon and wood. Taste is rich, dessert like, creamy full body. Rich chocolate cake and bourbonn blend together adding notes of charred wood. Not sweet but adds some malt berery flavors in back finishing semi dry. My favorite of the 3 I tried.	4.17
3412	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Bottle shared by tlay10. Into a tulip. 2007.. Looks like you might expect, but thinner.. A little oxidized. A lot of the honey, sherry qualities brought on by age. Beneath: assloads of butterscotch, toasted oak, dark chocolate. A little licorice..  547 characters	3.83
3413	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	2008 vintage served at Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fà in Rome.. This is almost a religious experience being able to finally try Kaggen. Pours an intense dark hue with a two inch brown head and good lacing. Immediately get a big whiff of chocolate, vanilla and oak. Very aromatically pleasing. The taste follows the nose with roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. Just a wonderfully smooth integration of all the elements as you sip on this and it feels as great in the mouth as going down. The worst part about this beer is that it comes to an end after 25cl. An absolute classic brew that I am grateful to have tried.	4.85
3414	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Review #1500!!! A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Can’t believe I FINALLY got to try this one!!! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent. So glad I got the chance to finally try this one and would love to do so over and over again.	4.55
3415	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks a lot, Brad! Served alongside Stormaktsporter.. 2009 vintage. The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter..  904 characters	4.85
3416	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	250ml Bottle First try in 2009 a 2006 Vintage. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fulfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful De Molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head. The wonderful roasted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, some distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel like you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anything but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).. Having had this on many more occasions and in many vintages, my original rating hasn’t changed a bit. i wish I could drink this every day.	5
3417	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Bought a bottle of 2008 in September 2011 at Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden.. A: Not as dark as I expected. Dark brown but thick, almost viscous. This looks like it will be a real mouthful.. Smell: Can't smell any of the alcohol.. Recovering from a cold but I know I can't smell alcohol but my senses are slightly muted. I get hints of chocolate, perhaps vanilla?.  699 characters	4.88
3418	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Usual black color for a stout, but the thick dark tan head and the clumpy lace made for a treat in the appearance department. Aroma was very nice as well, well integrated bourbon notes with soft malt roasting, chocolate/chocolate malt. Pair that with a mild oak and leather in the aroma, a very nice beer already.. Taste, wow, beautiful, hides the alcohol well, the bourbon barrel like notes don't dominate, nothing dominates, is extremely easy to drink, especially for the heft of the alcohol. A mild smooth sweetness, almost honey like along with faint vanilla. Mouthfeel not overly thick, allows every component of the beer to come out oh so nicely. One of the more rare things for a barrel aged stout to do is allow for a caramel smoothness to help out, and this one does just that. Its not all about being the biggest and most abrasive peeps!. One of the best bal stouts in the world. Thanks to jh1982, dsgolovin & largadeer for putting together a combo of beers outside of Triple Rock for me and the ladyfriend to join in sampling, best beers of the weekend (well actually 2012 so far).	4.73
3419	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	poured a deep dark color with a coffee creme brown head. Nose is coffee,bourbon, oak, chocolate, roasted malts. Taste is everything in the nose with hints of dark fruits, molasses and some balancing hop bitterness. Hints of soy sauce as well. The aftertaste is full and round, creamy even. The best i ever had in a stout. Mouthfeel is thick creamy and smooth. Overall: even better than the regular, the best out there.	5
3420	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Black body, about 1 inch of brown head.. Aroma has a beautiful smoke and dark chocolate/coffee mixture. Heavily roasted malts and some ashiness. Barrel comes through very well. Charred oak and light caramel.. The barrel is upfront in the flavor. It hides a lot of the depth and complexity that the base beer had. I don’t get as much of the sweetness and the ashy flavor is a little toned down..  597 characters	4.15
3421	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Thanks to johndoe8 for this badass brew. 2009 vintage. A-dark body with a mocha head that disapates slowly. S-smooth oak and bourbon undertones that take a little bit of twirling to bring out.  375 characters	4.85
3422	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. Thanks a ton to Paulmpapp for bringing this out to our whale tasting.. Appearance: Typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace.. Smell: The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose..  1,233 characters	4.58
3423	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Thanks to PaulMPap for bringing out this rarity.. Pours out a thick, dark, dark, dark brown with frothy tan head that laces up and has some retention.. Aroma is intriguing. Lots of dark fruit, mollasses sweetness, some chocolate and rich malt. Subtle bourbon..  498 characters	4.85
3424	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	I purchased a bottle of this (2006 vintage) in July 2011 at Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden for the staggering price of 375 kroner. It was a real bank breaker, but a treat as well. Reviewed from extensive notes. I was skeptical going into this beer, as I feel you have to be if people are claiming it's the best beer in the world (or even for the style).. Served from the bottle into a standard stemware glass (25cl) at Akkurat.. A: Pours a 2.5 finger head of beautiful brown-ruby colour, lovely cream, and brilliant thickness. Retention is excellent in general, but astounding for the high ABV. I love the unique colour of the creamy head. Solid nontransparent black colour. Very fucking appealing..  2,448 characters	4.88
3425	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Huge thanks to Eric for bringing this out to our tasting in Canton on a rainy Tuesday night in August. I was certainly happy to make the trip down to get the chance to try this well regarded brew – I figured this may be my only chance!. 2008 version, 250ml bottle into a snifter.. The pour looked great. There's a dark beer with some chocolate and midnight hues swirling around the glass. A touch of head quickly dissipates but that's to be expected with a big barrel aged brew like this. The beer looks thick and, while there's no lace, this is a very appealing glass..  2,418 characters	4.12
3426	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	"First had this one at the 2010 BOREFTS Festival at De Molen in Bordegrave, Holland. Along with the base beer and two other barrel aged variants, the Narke stouts were one of the highlights of the festival for me. Was also lucky enough to be able to buy a bottle at the festival to take away, and Doopie was so generous to let me have his to take home. Thanks again bro.. From a 25cl bottle bottle into a snifter
Vintage: 2009
Drunk directly after a 2008 base Stormaktsporter. APPEARANCE: A black pour, slightly darker than the base, makes a medium sized, medium-thick tan head that fades rather quickly. A wisp and bubbly ring are left behind. Jet black body and zero carbonation evident. A ring remains until the end and leaves some dots of lacing down the glass. Much the same as the base, though slightly darker pour..  2,462 characters"	4.5
3427	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	2008 version. Big thanks to Masterski for getting me this bottle, one that I've wanted to try for a long time but never pulled together a trade (thanks a ton Alex!).. I shared this at a tasting in northern OH, a pretty exceptional Tuesday night. Dark brown and faintly translucent, with the thinnest of foams on top. The aroma is quite nice, but to be honest I was expecting so much that I was actually a little disappointed. Taking the expectations out of it this was very good. Less roasty than I would have thought, this had more tobacco and leather to it than stouts normally do. Earthy, that's probably the correct adjective.. Some dark fruits in the flavor, plum/raisin type of thing, with lots of earthy character (I think I'm liking this term a lot). Not as strong tasting a stout as I expected, this was nothing like bourbon stouts in the USA aspire to be. Much more nuanced, less easily appreciated I think. That said I enjoyed searching out the flavors..  1,245 characters	4.04
3428	Kaggen! Stormaktsporter	Bottled. Pours pitch black with a little brown head. Nose of raisins, prunes and burned malt. Flavour of caramel, smoke, vanilla, dark malts, dried fruits, dark chocolate and notes of honey. It is full bodied has a oily texture and a soft carbonation. Long malty finish. It is a very enjoyable brew.	4.35
3429	Susan	"Had on tap at HF and grabbed a 750 swing top growler as well.
Stunning looking full creamy head on an opaque hazy soft yellow base. Nose slightly understated but flavor was packed full of mango; pineapple and citrus. Modest dank as beer opened up a bit; but not distracting or overly bitter.
Body was just about perfect and incredibly smooth.
Overall one of the very best IPAs I’ve ever had."	4.54
3430	Susan	I found Susan on tap at Armsby Abbey on a recent trip to Massachusetts - a bit of a detour, but well worth the drive (for food and beer both).. Susan is a tremendous warm day beer - I had no A/C in my car and was quite hot. Susan is tropical, with some pineapple and malt and hoppy bitter fruitiness. It's damned fine and refreshing - I wish that Hill Farmstead distributed or tapped in the Midwest.	4.41
3431	Susan	"Perfect pour from a growler, small fluffy head, lacing all the way down the glass, hazy amber.
Not a strong smell, mostly getting juice some orange juice scent, lots of fruit.
Taste is along with the nose. Lots of orange juice and tropical fruit taste. Extremely smooth and way too easy to drink. You get a little bit of the pine/bitterness at the very end.. One of the smoothest/easiest to drink ipas I've ever had. But it's missing that stone fruit/dank hop flavor that are in my favorite ipas."	4.65
3432	Susan	a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now. it may have been a game changer when it first came out, but it certainly isnt anything new anymore. this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere, and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic, more northwestern than southern hemisphere, but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away, which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa. it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry, while also being drinkable but substantial, round medium body but fast finishing, the right elements of the hops linger too, no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness. it does have some bitterness though, not all juice, and the grapefruity piney flavors, almost assuredly simcoe derived, do have some resolution, but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple, papaya, and juniper that turn me on here. so alive from the tap, almost chuggable for what it is, probably ahead of its time when it was introduced, not decidedly in the middle of whats hot, but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else, including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about. from a flavor standpoint, its great but not revolutionary, but through the lens of quality, its as good as it gets!	4.33
3433	Susan	"On tap Mission Dolores, Brooklyn.
Deep haze; flowers + citrus; big orange juice with flecks of herb + resin; dead smooth.. 4 4 4.25 4.25 4.25. Citra, Simcoe, and Riwaka.  438 characters"	4.18
3434	Susan	Draught: this one pours a murky, golden color. There was a wisp of a white head and some lacing. Nice nose! Grapefruit, tropical and citrus hops. The taste is very good. A faint bitterness, and lots of juicy hops. They blend together to make something that is just excellent!	4.53
3435	Susan	Had on tap. Pours cloudy bright gold color with one finger white head with ample lacing.. Modest aroma of citrus and pine. Very clean smelling.. Hop forward with pine and lemon notes. Super smooth with the lemon kicking in late alomg with a lingrring light sweetness..  436 characters	4.59
3436	Susan	"Lucky enoug that Upright Brew House in the West Village (NYC) was pouring drafts of Susan. Never a surprise to be impressed by Hill Farmstead.. L: approachable orange haziness
S: dank sweet sugary peach pie with a doughy pleasantry
T: clean and easy fruit with peach in the forefront. Almost sessionable
F: hit all parts of my palate with good balance of fruit, slight pine, sugars, and just the right hop notes without being muddled
O: A top go to when I’m lucky enough to find"	4.7
3437	Susan	"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro.. L — Pours an orangey amber haze with a small white head that dissipates quickly but laces well. Doesn’t look as murky as some NEIPAs can - the haze is more inviting
S — Dank new sneaker, orange, pine, chalky yeastiness, hint of weed. Definitely citra-dominant, smells a lot like Julius
T — Crisp, herbaceous, and rindy with nice undertones of tropical fruits, grapefruit flesh, and bready malts. Hop bitterness is more present than in many NEIPAs, but it’s not at all biting or resinous
F — Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. Very drinkable, with minimal bitterness in the semi-dry, fruity finish
O — First time trying a HF brew, and really digging how well put-together all the aspects are. Reminds me of a ‘softer’, ‘updated’ Heady Topper. 90/100.  955 characters"	4.46
3438	Susan	Enjoyed a couple pours from a freshly tapped keg while in Vermont. So excited to try this beer. Sipping on Edward prior to so I already have a hell of a reference point.. OG cloudy, orangish-yellowish pour with a moderate head of tightly packed foam. Beautiful lacing follows the beer’s path around the glass.. Aroma is freshly cut citrus and green leafy hops straight from the vine - orange, tangerine, peach, papaya and subtle pine. Lightly floral. Mouth watering..  763 characters	4.34
3439	Susan	25 cl pour at the brewery. Pours a hazy pale orange in color with a finger+ of white head. Aroma and taste have some stone and tropical fruits with a bit of cantaloupe and a heavy earthy note. Everything sounds like something I'd love but this one is just very good as opposed to great.	4.03
3440	Susan	750ml swing top growler poured into shaker pint, poured on 8/30 best by of 9/6.. A: murky tan orangish buddy, very small wispy white head that settles as a film.. S: light apricot, cantaloupe, a little herbal and earthy..  525 characters	4
3441	Susan	on draft, in a shaker pint glass. hazy, opaque, dark golden orange colored. no head. big well rounded hop aroma- fruity, dank, grassy, floral all at the same time. low bitterness, hop flavors dominate. medium bodied.	4.18
3442	Susan	The appearance was a nice looking hazy bronzed orange color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some messy lacing. The smell started off with some sweet peach, light apricots, light pine blend bittersweet and sound off together really nicely. The taste was bittersweet all of the way through in the previously mentioned flavors running into a nice semi-sweet to bitter citrus aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice bittersweet feel on my tongue. Sessionable enough to want to have with food. Overall, I’d have this again. Its pretty good.	3.99
3443	Susan	"A: Pours a hazy ruddy golden color with a half finger white head.
S: Fairly mellow, but some pretty nice hints of pink grapefruit, orange sherbet, powdery malt and a little mango.
T: Just unbelievably clean. A perfect melding of light pine, mango, light malt backbone, mild kiwi and just a touch of grapefruit pith on the finish. Carbonation is feathery and just barely there. With probably any other beer it wouldn't be enough, but it's perfect in here. Love this one."	4.44
3444	Susan	"Appearance: hazy light orange in color with a 2"" head that slowly falls to a thick surface covering. Nice lace develops.. Smell: oranges, tropical fruit, with a grassy and floral aroma.. Taste: caramel, mango, pineapple, pears, grass, and a floral bitterness..  390 characters"	4.58
3445	Susan	On tap in DC at Churchkey. Hops: Citra, Simcoe, Riwaka (never heard of it). This was outstanding. Incredible body and profile. Tangerine, lemon meringue. Soft carbonation and refreshing.	4.59
3446	Susan	Full pour at CK. Pretty gross. Smells great but has a nasty vegetal note that dominates the flavor. Had this same flavor in an off batch of Edward last year.	3.72
3447	Susan	"Hazy golden yellow, medium head. Dry fruit aroma, apricot, a bit of pineapple with classic HF floral nose on it. Smells like walking through a flower patch after a summer rain. Tons of peach & pineapple upfront, mid palate brings mango and kiwi, some very faint honeysuckle and hibiscus way at the end, finishes with perfect amount of bitter hop and pineapple again. Just a wonderfully delicate citrus hop beer, like ""juice"" but still beer unlike some of these lactose sugar ""juice bombs"" out there. A standard for IPAs. A rare perfect 5 beer in my book."	5
3448	Susan	"After a weekend of tasting some of the top 100 beers on a tour around
NYC. The Wife asked ""What was the best beer you had this weekend? "" Well now you know. Amazing taste , color and feel . Doesn't get much better than this one."	4.93
3449	Susan	On tap at Manhattan in Burlington.. Pours avery hazy orange, completely opaque.. Smell is tropical and a bit dank. Mango, with hints of pine and vanilla..  442 characters	4.5
3450	Susan	"Poured into a tulip. Very hazy and slightly turbid on the pour with a golden straw color. A modest bright white head that left fairly quickly but left the glass with some sturdy, splotchy laces. The nose was bright: sweet grapefruit, grassiness, mango, and a bit of blueberry. I noticed the grapefruit on the palate first. Not bracingly bitter but not ""soft"" either. The mid-palate was more earthy with pine, berries, grass, and dry bready malt. The finish was clean with a rising bitterness that framed the taste for me. Nice and light-feeling on the palate despite it's massive flavor, but not at all thin. A fantastic beer."	4.51
3451	Susan	Completely hazed golden with dense white head, strong lacing. Tropical nose mainly pineapple, other berries maybe. Taste is bitter, not much malt presence, grapefruit juice in an ale. Mouth coating resiny feel with below average body and carbonation.	4.33
3452	Susan	"Hazy orange pour with an inch of white fluffy head
Smells of mango, pineapple, peach, papaya, kiwi
Taste matches the nose with a slight grassy, metallic hint
Pillowy mouthfeel, awesome for the style reminds me of TH feel
Only dinged for the look, but otherwise outstanding -one of my favorite HF!"	4.7
3453	Susan	On tap at Malt & Mold. Poured a completely opaque golden orange with a nice foamy head to it. The nose is very fruity with citrus playing lead. The flavor follows the nose, definitely a juice bomb with the slightest amount of bitterness and malt. The feel is medium, decent carbonation, and a quick finish. This one has been on my list for a while and glad to finally be having it. A northeast IPA done to perfection.	4.6
3454	Hold On To Sunshine	TREE HOUSE HOLD ONTO SUNSHINE MILK STOUT 10/17/19. Acquired at the brewery 9/25/19. Canned 9/18. Interesting can art of a bright space shining among surrounding darkness.. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Samuel Smith English tulip pint..  786 characters	4.21
3455	Hold On To Sunshine	"Canned on 9/18. Poured to Glass on 10/12.
A: Very Dark Brown/black with thin clouds.
S: Coffee, Chocolate,
T: Same with aromas. Coffee+Chocolate+slightly strong sweet milk+
M:Slightly sticky and sweetness is stronger than others.
O: Prefer a little bit less sweet side personally. Light Carbo.
ABV: 7.6%"	4.23
3456	Hold On To Sunshine	Canned 9.12.19, opened 9.21.19. “Find a little space, so he move in between”. Poured into a nonic, jet black liquid, three finger , dense , creamy taupe foam cap, some lacings.  404 characters	4.6
3457	Hold On To Sunshine	16 oz. can. Black body. Smells of coffee, chocolate, a little lactose, and light roasted malts. Tastes of sweet milk chocolate, coffee, lactose, and a roasty finish. I don't get any peanut butter, which I didn't know was in it until reading the description. Medium heavy. Wouldn't want to drink a lot of this.	3.28
3458	Hold On To Sunshine	L - 2-finger hazelnut head rapidly fades down into a cola-black body.. S - coffee, caramel, peanut butter, milk chocolate. Yum.. T - tons of chocolate-dipped peanut butter. Some coffee, caramel. Slightly acidic finish. Low bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness..  338 characters	4.34
3459	Hold On To Sunshine	On tap at the brewery.. Very similar to other TH stout. Cocoa powder, chocolate, Hershey’s syrup, and this one has some peanut butter showing.. Full bodied. Syrupy thick. On point with the others.	4.25
3460	Hold On To Sunshine	Pours very dark almost black in the glass with a thick frothy head, taste is coffee, chocolate, cocoa, creamy mouthfeel, one of the better stouts I've had.	4.58
3461	Hold On To Sunshine	4.56?! C'mon? This is a fantastic beer and I realize treehouse has the ability to unite the Kurds and the Shiites at an open bar Jewish wedding but relax. I've had better. Not a ton, but I've had better.	4.25
3462	Hold On To Sunshine	Tasted from can. Pours black with a thick beige head. Aroma of chocolate peanuts coffee and caramel. Moderately sweet with a nice bitter backbone. Flavors of coffee, cocoa, peanut butter cups, molasses, caramel. An awesome milk stout. May be my all time favorite.	4.82
3463	Hold On To Sunshine	Stark syrupy black with a tall, frothy milk chocolate colored foam that slowly settles, clinging in tall ridges.. Smell has a touch of peanut with dark roasted malt, coffee and chocolate--it's not all that complex and seems more like an old school stout from here.. Taste has minimal peanut butter, and is more coffee forward, with acidity, but also some sweet cocoa liqueur. The dark roast itself is nutty, but moreso from the malt as it's not really giving any sort of peanut butter character..  578 characters	3.81
3464	Hold On To Sunshine	Fantastic Milk Stout, my favorite canned Stout from Treehouse. Nice thick coating mouthfeel with loads of flavor. Slightly sweet but overly so, just right. Great job here.	4.96
3465	Hold On To Sunshine	Very subtle peanut butter which is fine by me as I’m not a peanut butter stout fan usually. Sweet like a milk stout but not overly so. There’s a touch more carbonation than I usually expect from a stout, but I like that as well. So much flavor for 7.6%abv. Glad to have tried it! Will pick it up again if given the chance.	4.25
3466	Hold On To Sunshine	Hold on to Sunshine is quite deliciously chocolate-y - rich. There's also a very nice, light peanut butter presence.. As peanut butter often does not finish very clean, Hold on is something of an exception - the finish actually is clean. While the beer isn't exactly heavy duty - it's no barrel-aged stout - it's definitely not sessionable. As rich as it is, and given the ABV, I feel like Hold on would exhaust the palate - and get you just a bit drunk.. Great beer, regardless.	4.31
3467	Hold On To Sunshine	Really good stout. This batch has more peanut butter present than the last which is very nice. Don’t get too much of it on the nose but the taste is there for sure. “All that is” was a little thin to me but this one is thick and coats your mouth. Love it.	4.53
3468	Hold On To Sunshine	Poured into a pint glass via can. Color is a deep mocha brown. Smell is roasted coffee beans and milk chocolate with a tad of toffee.  323 characters	4.59
3469	Hold On To Sunshine	Pours dark brown, almost black. Smaller dark brown head.. Smells like coffee and a hint of chocolate.. Delicious coffee flavor with chocolate on the back end.  281 characters	4.6
3470	Hold On To Sunshine	"Sampling a cellar temp can poured into my snifter. Beer is part of a trade with @oldlady, thanks man!
The beer pours a dark cola brown color with no light passing through my glass. A creamy tan head of 1cm foams up on the pour and fades to a wispy surface layer with thin lacing on the edge and after each sip.
The aroma is sweet chocolate, biscuity cracker grain notes, peanut husk and shell aromas and a little bit of coffee ground and roasted scents buried in the nose. As expected for this brew, I think I would put gunners Daughter a little favorable for the nose, but this is definitely an appealing one.
First sip reveals a smooth silky texture with very fine and tingly carbonation. Nice physical traits on this one.
Flavor is what the nose advertises with lots of malt profile. Some milk chocolate, roasted notes and coffee grounds mixing with some sweet brown sugar and peanut butter hit here. I dont get any hop presence and find that the booze is well hidden too. This is a sweet malt lovers beer and ya gotta like peanut butter too. Im a fine and would buy this one again, but I dont think I would drink more than one at a sitting. Another nice stout from TH."	4.38
3471	Hold On To Sunshine	Picked-up two cans at the Tree House Brewery in Charlton last Saturday. My 23rd brew reviewed from these guys. Canned-on date of 11/2/18. Enjoy, but rarely drink stout, always enjoy peanut butter. This smells and tastes delicious, nice to see an IPA factory can put out great brews from other styles.	4.5
3472	Hold On To Sunshine	Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is decadent milk chocolate, caramel, and slight taste of peanut butter at the finish. Silky, medium bodied, sweet, roasty, with low carbonation. Maybe my favorite stout/dark beer from Tree House. The body is amazing--the best body I have had on a stout in some time. Super tasty dessert style beer. Need to get more of this.	4.64
3473	Hold On To Sunshine	Nose is dark and milk chocolate with a hint of peanut butter. Creamy, decadent. A liquified peanut butter cup with a shot of black coffee, in all the best ways. Long, delicious finish.	4.74
3474	Hold On To Sunshine	09/2017 - incredible nose of peanut butter, coffee, vanilla, and chocolate; flavors are akin, with more roast and a touch of bitterness coming out; the body is sadly thin - like TWSS. Yum still!	4.44
3475	Hold On To Sunshine	Didn’t get as much peanut butter as I was hoping here but tasty nonetheless. I also feel like TH is splitting hairs with their stouts. They gotta get out of their comfort zone ImO	4.4
3476	Hold On To Sunshine	"L -- Very dark black body with a finger and a half of brown head produced with fairly gentle pour. Some retention and lacing
S -- Coffee syrup, peanut, hazelnut, walnut, milk chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, booze
T -- Tastes like straight up melted coffee ice cream. Hint of umami and rich nuttiness
F -- Soft, silky, and creamy. Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. Pretty minimal bitterness throughout, but could be a little thicker
O -- Reminds me of Trillium's PB PM Dawn. Quite crushable. 87/100"	4.35
3477	Hold On To Sunshine	Bought a can at Tree House. Pure black appearance with no head. Roasted dark chocolate, maybe hazelnut, and black coffee aromas. Taste follows the nose with a warm, light boozy coffee flavor. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall, fantastic across the board.	4.64
3478	Hold On To Sunshine	Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a very pleasant blend of coffee and chocolate. Taste is a very smooth pleasant coffee and chocolate.	4.54
3479	The Abyss	"2016
Jet with mocha foam; licorice + meat nose; anise, soy, jerky, roast, some wood, mellows into dark chocolate + cherry stones, ashy end; round + chewy.. 4 4.25 4.25 4.25 4. Far too savoury - big hit of Bovril. My first Abyss (after years of chasing) so I’m not sure if this is supposed to be a lean, not-sweet RIS, but it’s showing signs of autolysis. Does get some chocolate, but something went wrong in the barrel..  462 characters"	4.19
3480	The Abyss	"2014 vintage (best after 11/10/15).
A 5 y/o beer, Bomber into tulip.
As black as they get, with 1/8” light brown layer of foam.
Aroma is heavy on chocolate toffee and licorice.
Taste is very slight dark and mild coffee with a bit more barrel and whiskey note, and tons of milk chocolate, toffee, and licorice
MOuthfeel is right between KBS and BCBS, so we’ll call it perfect. Great balancing bitterness with a pleasantly present carbonation. Zero oxidation (must be the wax).
Just fantastic, not much else you can say. I’m sad it’s gone."	4.64
3481	The Abyss	"Look: Appears viscous pouring from the bottle. Pitch black in the glass, with a light brown, craggy, two finger head. The foam settles and leaves a lot of lace in its wake. As I drink down the beer a ton of lacing. Opaque and no visible carbonation.. Smell: Milk chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, raisin, prune, coffee, chocolate covered raspberry jelly rings, plum, chocolate berry cordial.. Taste: The tip of the tongue is sweet cherry,
dark chocolate, sweet and juicy plum with some acidity. These sweet and dark fruit notes yield mid palate to the wine barrel influence on the beer. Rich notes of tart blackberry, leather and tobacco. Bitter, toasty, woody and oak forward. The finish on this beer resembles red wine more than most other beers I’ve had..  1,254 characters"	4.5
3482	The Abyss	I think I have had this beer many times, with many vintages. I have had them fresh, and I have had them aged. And for some reason, I have not reviewed it until today.. So I am rating a vintage bottled on 10/30/17. First pour was from a bottle that had been at room temperature for years and the second pour was after refrigerating for a half hour. I know, not much.. Appearance is a dark brown more than black, with a very frothy and creamy tan foam and lacing. Smell is wet boozy oak and bourbon barrels first, followed by dark fruit (wine grapes and raisins), then mildly sweet vanilla and molasses, and finished with a hint of cherry. The feel is sublime in an excellent way, easily the best thing about the beer. The almost light body and slightly dry finish gel extremely well with the heavy booze presence in a unique fashion. You just don’t expect what you get here..  977 characters	4.62
3483	The Abyss	"22oz bottle. Waxed and capped bottle. 2014 vintage. Best after date of '11/10/15'.
Black colored body, with a thin brown back lit edge. Two fingers of tan head, which settles down in a few minutes. Leaves spots of lacing on the glass.
Aroma of rich dark roasted malts, with dark molasses, black licorice, and barrel touches.
Taste emphasizes the molasses and licorice, and ends with a chocolate note. There are small nuances of cherry and vanilla. Dry at the end.
Medium plus mouth feel, with a smooth texture. Good carbonation in presentation, but not so much in feel.
This beer has aged into a real blend of the dark flavors as dominant. The higher ABV% provides that vapors that sit above the body, but do not burn. These vapors result in clearer nasal passages. Quite easy to drink, and because the end is so dry, the urge is to take another sip (or medium quaff). Barrel expression is minimal, but I do get a touch of the oak wine barrel. Bitterness is less than medium, and is a little surprising considering the dense dark smells and flavors."	4.48
3484	The Abyss	I have tried several different vintages, only the 12 month 100% Barrel aged versions were any good. Deschutes needs to step up. I still see bottles of Abyss on the shelves.	3.83
3485	The Abyss	The abyss pours a black color, small lacong tan head. Aroma is rich, dry oak. Flavor is dry very rich, hi ts of nature and lictorice. Great heavy thick body. Overall great beer very flavorfull.	4.55
3486	The Abyss	"The Abyss 2015 Reserve. Pours thick and dark, nearly impervious to light. Thin mocha head recedes quickly. Aroma opens up nicely as it sits. Lots of dark chocolate, loads of anise, tons of molasses. Just smells so dense and rich. Flavor is very intense: the anise dominates but there is still a big showing of chocolate, dark molasses, bitter espresso, ample barrel presence. Fairly thick feel. Overall this is a fantastic BA imperial Stout. I bought 6 of these in 2016 and so far it has aged beautifully. Highly recommended.. 5/1/19
Bomber
4.5 rating"	4.56
3487	The Abyss	Poured a motor oil black with minimal tan head that left lace spots. Aroma has minimal booziness with a mix of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, hints of vanilla and dark cherry (which I assume is the licorice (black cherry licorice?)). The beer has an oaky smoothness with a mix of chocolate and cherry/licorice like sweetness, balanced by a roasted coffee edge and a note of booze.	4
3488	The Abyss	2018 vintage had on 4/18/19. The heavenly aroma just doesn't translate over to the taste, which is barely there even when its just a little below room temperature. Molasses, a hint of bourbon and then dark chocolate hit the palate in quick succession, then fade into a tannic mouthfeel after a minute or two between sips. While brewed with the ingredients for a stellar BA imperial stout, this one comes up a bit short.	3.82
3489	The Abyss	Review/rating logged about two months after having it.. Had this at about 3 years old, with a number of other imperial stouts. Although it was a great imperial stout, considering the price, I was disappointed.	4.13
3490	The Abyss	"pitch black, fine beige foam
chocolate, booze, licorice
booze, chocolate, licorice, coffee
fine gently carbonation, substantial burn from the Bourbon
Certainly a top Bourbon Barrel aged stout. However, it is not overly expressive and leans more towards coffee and licorice than chocolate which I would prefer"	4.04
3491	The Abyss	This is a beer that I haven't previously reviewed because I never it liked as much as the score indicates I should (it's got a strange bitterness to me). This time, I opened a 2014 bottle in 2019, and though it's slightly better, it still has an odd bitterness for me.. Appearance – Pours a nice black color with a surprisingly thick chocolate colored head (surprising due to the aging on this bottle). Slightly larger than normal sized bubbles in the head that stick to the walls of the glass. A nice looking beer!. Smell – Malt, molasses, licorice, cherry bark, oak, and red wine. A very light hint of bourbon and vanilla..  910 characters	4.01
3492	The Abyss	"2015 vintage enjoyed February 2019. Pours a deep black with short lived tight brown head. Aroma is complex with molasses, dark chocolate, licorice, but with strong notes of dark fruits.
Taste has the dark fruits and molasses up front with licorice, bittersweet chocolate, but a strong sense of coffee as well as cherry in the back. Bitterness lingers in the smooth full mouthfeel, increasingly complex as it warms. Wonderful beer."	4.34
3493	The Abyss	"2017 bottle. Thanks to Phil for this one.. Dark brown body with a brown two finger head. Soapy, foamy, creamy. Its it an intense looking beer.
An equally intense aroma. Roasted malts, dark molasses, very woody with lots of anise, dates and dark currants.
Aggressive yet balanced taste. Roasted malts, dark molasses, oaky, intense spices, a solid dose of valilla, espresso bitterness and barrel char in the finish.
Surprisingly smooth mouth feel, drier in the finish. A good nip of alcohol. Tannins and cherries in the after taste. Heavy body medium carbonation."	4.46
3494	The Abyss	"1 PINT 6 FLUID OUNCE bottle
Served in a snifter
2014. This beer pours dark and foreboding. It is topped with a couple inches of deep mocha head that clings to the sides of the glass as it recedes like my hairline.. I notice dark fruits at first. Cherry and plum come to mind. Anise is the next thing my schnozz detects. Dark chocolate and coffee round out the aroma..  650 characters"	4.27
3495	The Abyss	"Bottle Date: 2015
Palate Contaminants: none. Here's hoping I didn't wait too long. I'll revisit if I think age is too much of a detriment.. Color is that opaque dark brown that doesn't really let any light through. Head is a very fine light brown that looks like a mousse. A reasonable amount of lacing considering the type..  1,295 characters"	4.54
3496	The Abyss	Date: Bottled on 10/30/17, savored on 12/05/18.. Appearance: Pours black as night with a dark mocha head the barely cover the top of the beer. The lacing clings to the glass beautifully when I give it a swirl before slowly cascading back down.. Aroma: The aroma is a large amount of vanilla bean, dark chocolate, bourbon sweetness, roasted malts, chocolate covered fruit, coffee, some licorice, and syrupy molasses..  1,675 characters	4.75
3497	The Abyss	Pours a deep, thick black with no head or lacing.. The smell is oak and red wine with a little chocolate and bourbon.. The taste shows the red wine and some black liquorice. There's also a strong leather/char taste. It's pretty bitter on the finish..  417 characters	4
3498	The Abyss	A very nice imperial stout but the stronger flavors of raisin and licorice were just a little too much for me. Pours a deep, rich dark black color with great dark tan head and sheets of lacing. Smells of deep rich chocolate and coffee, along with fainter dark stone fruit, malt and caramel. Tastes of deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate mocha, vanilla, caramel, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, malt and licorice. Just too much raisin and licorice for me. Smooth mild mouthfeel, surprisingly not that creamy. Clean and silky, just enough carbonation. A strong beer but a little disappointing given the huge ratings and reviews here.	4.18
3499	The Abyss	A lot toastier and maltier with some good dark chocolate taste. Not sweet like so many in this style but in a good way. Oddly, I drank the bottle over two days and it actually tasted better after being exposed for a day.	4.5
3500	The Abyss	Smells like hot caramel. Looks quite alluring in a sniffer. Wow. Intense flavor here. Obvious roasted malts, but something else...maybe kahlua-like. Very thick. Super alcoholic. Delicious. Like hot fudge. Rich.	4.39
3501	The Abyss	2016 Bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a small amount of caramel colored head. Laced the glass with each sip. Scent was roasted malt and some excess booze. Taste was strong of cherry and a slight roasted malt aftertaste. Smooth for the ABV and alcohol scent.	4.31
3502	The Abyss	Abyss 2015. Pours a pitch black color with a small brown head. There is decent retention with good lacing, Deep roasted aroma with red wine and slight cherry. Smooth taste - mild molasses, roasted, red wine and cherry. Medium to heavy bodied with mild carbonation.	4.47
3503	The Abyss	Beautiful dark and rich looking Beer. Good thick and creamy head. Great lacing. Rich aromas of molasses and licorice and so many to ponder. Taste is lots of molasses and enough bitterness to know this is a beer. The alcohol is strong and that adds to the overall flavor. Overall this what we dream about in craft beer. On draft at Ron’s Corner Tavern. The 2016 version I’m told.	4.43
3504	Darkness	750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/25/2019. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky tan head with amazing retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Amazing appearance. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Mild increasing booze as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with big strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery, roast, charred bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, dark bread/crust, licorice, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with an awesome hop/char bitter/sweet balance; and no minimal acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 12% after the finish. Overall this is an amazing Russian imperial stout. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV with the modestly bitter/charred/resinous/drying finish. Nicely soft, and not overly bitter/charred. Definitely needs a bit of age for the freshness. Perfectly balanced between super rich dark/black/roasted malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast. Mild residual sweetness with lingering hop/char bitter dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing spot on style example as expected. Reminds me of Old Raspy a lot on the fresh hop intensity.	4.36
3505	Darkness	I tried a bottle of this at the brewery whilst in town for a work conference with my co-workers. The beer poured an opaque dark and had thin tan head that did not leave much lacing. The scent had dark fruit and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast malt base and dark fruit and raisin highlights. The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.	4.33
3506	Darkness	2016 version, Hades Cerberus bottle art which is superb. No abv indicated on the bottle, this is evidently a 12% RIS.. Aggressive pour yields a one-inch head of creamy tan foam. Body of the beer is predictably pitch black. This is a great looking beer and after you blow through a little bit of it you'll observe some really unique lacing out of a clean snifter.. Nose is heavy chocolate, some tobacco and maybe a little molasses. Detect no alcohol which I rarely do from beer anyway..  1,315 characters	4.75
3507	Darkness	2010 Vintage (Vampire artwork)... poured from a black waxed bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Dark, dark mahogany pour.. nearly black with thin off-white head. Nice ring of lacing.. S: Rich and roasty... cocoa, dark fruit, aromatic wood, and burned sugars..  718 characters	4.5
3508	Darkness	Tasted from bottle aged 4 years. Pours black with thick beige head. Aroma is raisins, cocoa and molasses. Thick and chewy. Lots of cherry on the flavor. Some coffee, cocoa, raisins. Awesome RIS.	4.73
3509	Darkness	Pours black with a finger of dense, khaki foam. Head retention as a whole is moderate, with the final ring lasting a long while after the pour. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts with heavy raisins, molasses, brown sugar, and toffee. It smells sweet, and nears on a sickly cloying level of sweetness straight out of the fridge. As it warms, the heavy raisins and dark fruits subside a touch, and with the gritty roasty malt bitterness, reaches a more favorable balance. Flavor profile is raisins, plums, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and smoke. Malts hit notes of roasty, toasty, nutty and caramely adding depth and darkness. Initially at fridge temperature, the balance is skewed towards a cloying level of sweetness, but as the beer warms, melds into a more favorable balance. A bit of residual malt bitterness helps taper the sweetness off the tongue at the end. Mouth feel is medium-thick, and turns to thick as the beer warms. It has a silty, very fine granular texture that adds to the weight of the experience. Overall, a stout with depth that remains dynamic every degree or so of temperature change. At the colder temperatures, it’s not much to talk about it, but as it nears the suggested serving temperatures, it really opens up and reveals its personality.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle. 2016 vintage reviewed in May of 2019.	4.37
3510	Darkness	Thick, chewy, roasty beer with lots of vanilla, cherry, raisin and dark chocolate. The beer finishes bitter. Shell is the same as the taste. Since this is 4 years old (2015 version) I am not getting much coffee but really good anyway.	4.63
3511	Darkness	"From the neck: ""10/27/16"". Appearance: The body is pitch black and the head is thick, large, frothy, creamy textured, and light khaki colored. It has amazing head retention and lacing. It is picture perfect.. Aroma: The beer smells like alcohol, a strong wood scent, chocolate, coffee, and burnt sugar..  792 characters"	3.86
3512	Darkness	The sum of all parts is pretty excellent. Really complex stout with waves of licorice, tobacco, dark fruit and sweet toffee. Little bitter finish rounds it out.. This 2016 was not as thick as the big boys of today, but drank really nice.	4.59
3513	Darkness	A - Pours motor oil black with a two finger tan head. Decent amount of soapy lacing.. S - Aroma is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts and cherries.. T - The taste is dark chocolate, coffee, cherries, raisins, plums, molasses, black licorice and light char..  423 characters	4.38
3514	Darkness	"On tap; poured into a snifter.
Appearance- jet black, thick consistency. Thin tan head that was fairly long-lasting for an RIS in a snifter; moderate lacing.
Smell - dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, raisins and molasses!
Taste - some chocolate covered cherry, light toffee, with a boozy, winter warmer style coffee; rich and bold flavor!
Feel - full-bodied, and slightly boozy; a definite sipper!
Overall- certainly a cinch up your big boy pants style RIS; better take it slow and steady with this one!"	4.16
3515	Darkness	I was happy to receive this beer through a BIF last year. Today was a great day I am going crack it open. The waxed cap gave way to a hiss and then the Russian Imperial Stout found its way to my nostrils, the smell was intoxicating. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour on the beer produced a two finger head with exceptional retention. The head medium tan dissipated slowly leaving heavy thick lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 dark brown nearly black. The beer is opaque. The beer has a beautiful appearance.. The initial aroma is dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. Next, I smell dark cherries, figs, anise, burnt sugar, toffee, herbal, bready, earthy, and malty sweetness.. The flavors in the beer are raisins, dark chocolate, coffee, tart cherries, herbal, spicy floral, resin, anise, char, a touch of smokiness, bready, earthy, malty sweetness, toffee, and a hint of soy sauce..  1,357 characters	4.53
3516	Darkness	"2016 version. I found this at a liquor store just north of Minneapolis and I am drinking it now because it's -35 degrees outside and getting colder. Thanks Fargo, ND for amazing drinking weather.
Smallish dark brownish tan head sit above a super dark coal black beer. Burnt malts, licorice, and I think maybe a bit of prune coming through in the nose. Dark rich malt with light licorice taste laced with very light hints of prunes, raisins, and undetermined attributes. I loved the aftertaste that was really dry without being really dry, caught me off guard in a weird way. The thing I liked most about this beer was that it had a great stout taste without shoving coffee, chocolate, or barrel aging down your throat. Don't get me wrong, I love those too, but this was a great beer that doesn't need to rely on those tricks."	4.43
3517	Darkness	On tap at Mikkeller & Friends in Copenhagen.. Pours jet black with a little halo of chocolate colored foam.. Smell is roasty with notes of coffee, cocoa, molasses and a hint of cinnamon and licorice..  537 characters	4.43
3518	Darkness	Pours pitch black with a brown head.. Roasted notes, slight cocoa note.. Roasted grain, cocoa, dark fruit. No trace of alcohol. Flavors were nice, but not what I would call flavorful really..  398 characters	4.42
3519	Darkness	Jet black beer in a glass. Dark khaki head with a 2 finger head (aggressive pour). Laces the glass well.. Smell of dark fruit, chocolate and dark malt.. A bit raw on the tongue (because of freshness to my knowledge). Still an outstanding brew at the moment. Will only get better with time..  362 characters	4.5
3520	Darkness	My quest is to try as many Russian Imperial Stouts as I can before I die, and find the best one. This one is now in the top two. Outstanding flavor. Kicks your ass like any superior RIS should. Worth every dollar I paid.	4.87
3521	Darkness	Pours a thick viscous black with a tan finger head that leaves substantial lacing. BIG aroma of dark (almost baker's) chocolate and cherries. A huge, complex flavor profile includes figs, raisins, dank earth, tree bark, light roast coffee, and dark chocolate. Smooth, silky, full body with moderate carbonation. The best example of the style I've ever had. Absolute perfection.	5
3522	Darkness	"A-Pours a very dark opaque color with a generous head and lacing
A-Aroma has chocolate, coffee, cherries and raising hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a nicely balanced chocolate, coffee, cherries and raisin flavors. The chocolate flavor stands out more as the beer warms to room temperature
M-A medium bodied moderately carbonated beer
O-A very well balanced stout with a strong kick"	5
3523	Darkness	L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a jet black color and a thick consistency. There was an inch of foamy, tan-colored, fairly long-lasting head. Good lacing.. S: A very nice aroma of chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee, and hops.. T: Tasted of a mild amount of hops (mainly in the finish), some dark fruit (raisins, mainly), some cherry notes, lots of dark chocolate, a fair bit of roasted malt (present throughout), and light toffee. Definitely a rich, bold flavor here. This is more or less what you think of as an RIS flavor, but it's also quite subtle. Quite flavorful and complex..  728 characters	4.27
3524	Darkness	I think when it comes to the look of a stout, the only real make/break is the quality of the head, and this was certainly nice with a thick beige head that leaves behind a creamy looking layer and some decent lacing. Big fragrant beer here, as raisin, molasses, fig and vanilla dominate the smell. The taste starts out abrasive with a bitter coffee upfront that turns towards dark chocolate and hints of vanilla and fig. Under it all is a touch of alcohol heat that plays into the aftertaste	4.29
3525	Darkness	2010 bottle (Vampire). This was quite simply the best tasting non-barrel-aged stout I have ever had. Although a little light on the nose, the taste came through with the most wonderful combination of intense black licorice, raisin, tobacco, and bitter chocolate (in that order).	4.66
3526	Darkness	This beer is amazing. I look forward to October every year to drink this beer. The barrel-aged Darkness is just as good. Let the Darkness flow through you.	4.93
3527	Darkness	Finally! After all of these years, I finally get to knock this one off of my Want list!. Had the opportunity to try this beer at the Great Taste of the Midwest parties on the night before the festival in Madison, WI. Surly did a tap takeover and I got the chance to meet Omar as well as lots of the Surly crew... it was a really cool night that I won't forget.... They tapped the 2015 version and I was able to grab a couple of pints of it to sip on while enjoying the night....  714 characters	4.5
3528	Darkness	This might be my favorite non-barrel aged imperial stout. I usually age all of my imperial stouts at least one year to kill off the hops to get that dark, chocolate-y, coffee-like, malty profile. This beer is a little hoppy, but I actually enjoy it. I haven't found another beer like it, so I'll continue to pay the hefty price (~$20/bomber). Wish they did 4pks!	4.56
3529	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	16 oz. can. Hazy pale orange. Smells of zesty citrus. Lime, tangerine, etc. Tastes of the same citrus peel. A little bit of malt, but it dries out. Boozy back end. Medium body. Big on booze, but not on sweetness. Good, but couldn't drink much.	3.8
3530	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Very cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Very strong and pleasant grapefruit aroma. Taste is a very smooth prominent grapefruit that exceptionally goid	4.73
3531	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	L - 1.5 finger dense offwhite head atop a dirty yellow body.. S - grapefruit, cotton candy.. T - dank grapefruit. Cotton candy, orange slices, tangerine, a little dirt. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness..  328 characters	4.02
3532	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; canned 02/06/19 and obtained at the brewery on its release date. Note, my friend got on line at 4:45 am when there were already at least 200 people there (thanks MB!)
A: Pours a cloudy, golden color with a less than one finger head with retention to no more than a rim and spidery lacing.
S: Cracking the can, I got immediate tangerine and ripe peach. Aromas range through tangerine, ripe peach, mango and a very strong showing of caramel. Pine and grapefruit also evident, but in the background a bit.
T: Semisweet. Palate largely follows the nose, drinks down to only a hint of sweet peach and juniper lingering deliciously on the tongue, followed by a peppery close.
M: Light to medium bodied with light to medium effervescence.
O: A complex and evolving flavor experience. Missed it on the 3rd anniversary proper, glad I was able to get to try it."	4.71
3533	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Canned 02/01/18, ‘3RD TIME CHARM’.. Pours very similar to the 2nd. Hazy golden yellow color. Frothy white head, full even lace.. The nose on this is super tropical. Sweet citrus, mango, pineapple. Hardly any bitterness or present hops..  451 characters	4.63
3534	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	16oz can into a snifter. Thanks Ryan for sharing.. Super hazy orange body, orange juice. Big fluffy white head.. Tangerines and citrus on the nose, dank fresh hops. Tropical citrus and raw hops on the tongue, green and fresh. Creamy mouthfeel, orange creamsicle. Medium-low carbonation.	4.5
3535	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Pours out a super hazed golden orange color, thin layer of dense bright white head leaves some lacing - it’s a beautiful brew, glows in the glass.. Nose is dominated by orange creamsicle, ripe mango, and peach, also some sugary bubble gum like notes and leafy herbal character playing in the background. Smells great!. Palate follows with a huge blast of tangerine, grapefruit, peaches, and lemon up front. Definite mango and pineapple notes give this one a super tropical flavor. There is some dankness in there as well, and sweet bready malts almost matched by a hit of pine resin on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full and very fluffy and smooth ... speaking of smooth this one drinks like it’s around 7-8% and the booze is nowhere to be found. Crazy good!!	4.75
3536	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	16 oz can poured into a tulip. Very opaque. Looks like pulpy orange juice. Aromas of tropical fruit, especially pineapple. Taste is pungent tropical fruit...sweet pineapple and some mango. Delicious. Feel is very full bodied. No sign of the 10% though. Overall, very well done beer for the abv. Super tropical and juicy!	4.66
3537	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	2018 release (4th anniversary). Canned about a week ago.. A: Pours a hazy, pale orange color with a tight ring of bright white head. Swaths of lacing and very good retention.. S: Creamy mango, sharp pine, a bit of dankness and candied citrus..  737 characters	4.25
3538	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Great murky color, super smooth! I would have bet anything that this wasn't 10%. Complex, danky, citrus, tropical aroma, and flavors that match. There was an enticing sweetness to the aroma and flavor as well. Made it smoother. Among my top IPAs all time!	5
3539	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	murky orange in color, taste is bitter citrus with some sweetness on the backend..this is a bit more dense than most, but that should be expected with a 10% IPA..drinks like a 7 or 8% thou..very smooth scant traces of the 10% ABV..upper echelon Other Half Beer	4.43
3540	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Canned 2/1/18 (3RD TIME CHARM), Enjoyed 2/6/18, Acquired in a trade.. Very smooth and creamy, super hop aroma and taste that is spectacular. Great haze and foam that lingers. Highly recommended.	4.66
3541	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Fun beer, but the mouthfeel is a little too much, maybe too much lupulin powder. Mind you, this beer was still tremendous. Not a beer you want to drink all the time, but fun to pull out for an anniversary.	4.41
3542	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	I really liked this one. It's packed with hops and there's Galaxy in there. It's a 10% very high for an IPA and you can tell as the abv is noticeable. I don't think it was necessary to make it that high so i downgraded because of it.	4.53
3543	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Can shared by jc1762. Thanks Jon!. Hazy, bright yellow body with a soapy, bone white head. Grandiose hop scents. Lemon and melon with prominent alcohol in both the nose and flavor. Lovely pineapple notes. That said, the heat doesn't bother me. Tons of flavor. A well executed beer.	4.5
3544	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Luckily for me I have friends who go to almost every OH release and are good enough to share. This was exactly what I expected. Another very solid - juicy IPA from OH. Not their best - Like Whoa is - but still very good. The NJ/NY craft beer scene is exploding and OH is one of the best. Well done	4.54
3545	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Poured into a 16 oz Troegs Snulip canned on 1/27/17. Pours a murky bright yellow, almost looks like orange pinapple juice, with a massive 3 finger sticky white head that leaves thick patches of lace.. Smell is guava, papaya, mango, pinapple, and grapefruit rind.. Taste follows nicely tropical all the way, a nice dose of pinapple and grapefruit in the slightly bitter finish..  748 characters	4.91
3546	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Hazy orange yellow color after being poured in to a pint glass. Tropical fruit smell with predominantly pineapple. Wonderful taste with nice bitter hop finish but has a balanced alcohol presence. Excellent	4.84
3547	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Probably the BEST Other Half offering I have had from them....and I have had some amazing Other Half Brews! Huge Juicy Hop Bomb!!! Glad I have a 2nd can to save for another sitting :)	5
3548	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	"This might have been the beer from Other Half that I was most eager to rate, as there was quite a bit of anticipation for this. Without a doubt, this lived up to those expectations as the beer was one of the smoothest and most complex that I ever had from them, easily exceeding the high standards that they've set over the last three years!. Nice can design to this with lots of ""3""'s on it with ""It's the Magic Number"" on the bottom above the date of 1/27. Of course, the pour was on par with that as the beer had a dank, peach hue to it with a head that held it's own and a nice web of lacing left behind on my Teku glass as I worked my way through this. Wonderful nose here as there was plenty of orange, tangerine, and citrus that could be smelled from halfway across the room once I popped the top. Plenty of those in the taste along with hop oils, pine, resin, a bit of earthy dankness, stone fruit, Other Half's yeast, and some garlic to round things out. Incredibly complex under the surface given how simple this seemed up-front though the juiciness, use of lupulin powder, and moderate, bready malt allowed the full range of flavors to really shine through. A low amount of carbonation and high amount of juicy slickness allowed for this beer to fully shine once it warmed up as the underlying candied sweetness and marmalade allowed everything to mesh well together. The earthy dankness that lingered in the aftertaste served as a metaphoric reminder of how the full range of flavors all left the ""party"" in unison as the liquid faded away.... This may have been the easiest beer of double-digit potency that I have *ever* reviewed on here as this was deceptively easy to quaff and leaving me want to pop open another once the can ran dry. While I admit that I""m a home for Other Half, it's beers like this that kept me waiting in line for hours and coming back for more. I can only hope that they make me eat my words in 2020 when I say that this may be the best that I've had from them and the apex of their brewing resume up until this point. Cheers to all they've done for beer snobs like myself!"	4.68
3549	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	fresh can drank on 2/16/2017. overall this kind of sums up a lot of the OH beers for me. The flavors are on point, especially for a high ABV IPA and the Lupulin powder certainly shines here. It does, however, have a boozy harshness to it that has to take it down a notch for me. I did enjoy this quite a bit, but it was boozy, which I tend to find common with the OH high ABVers. It's nitpicking because it was a really enjoyable beer.	4.4
3550	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	I think this beer is top notch. My only complaint is i think they could hide the 10% heat a little better. Everything is there for this beer great citrus/floral notes and taste great mouth feel, Just tastes a bit boozy. I almost want to put it into the triple IPA category. If it was it would be the best out there.	4.59
3551	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Big juicy beer - looks like it and tastes like it - opaque gold, grapefruit-orange-looking body, two fingers of off-white foam that slide down the glass with sheets of lace trailing behind. Pungent aromas of rich citrus and orchard fruit, like orange and grapefruit; flavors follow in kind but with tropical impressions like pineapple added to the mix; moderately bitter and sweet, full-feeling and medium-weight, cushy carbonation and soft - yet another NE-style winner - 10% abv and an barely legible canning date - presumably 1/27/17.	4.5
3552	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Received in trade. Pours a hazy golden straw yellow with hints of orange. Pulp like look in the glass. After cracking the can open you get citrus and light tropical fruit wafting from the can. The nose post pour is fairly bold and large. The nose is of citrus both grapefruit and orange as well as light tropical fruits, pineapple and a bit of very light pine. While the nose is a bolder citrus I felt like I was picking up the tropical fruits Upon first taste, fresh tropical fruit/pineapple juice led way to a citrus pith/rind. At 10% and triple dry hopped plus the addition of Lupulin powder I still feel like I found a bit of a sweet doughy malt hint altho it was very nuanced and disappeared quickly. The alcohol hides well at colder temps but as the beer warmed the alcohol seemed to become more pronounced and a bit hot. I'm not sure the triple dry hop did much for the beer but I get why they did it. Overall it was a fairly smooth with a medium body and easy to drink for a 10% imperial triple dry hopped brew. Very good.	4.56
3553	3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA	Look is orange juice. It's hazy and super thick- I love it. Smell is very fruity and juicy. I assume that's citra Hops? Taste is also juicy. It's surprisingly not very bitter for a 10% DIPA. World class. Other Half, you rock!	4.87
3554	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Becoming somewhat more accessible, I had this at Brick Store Pub (ATL) on draft for Zwanze day 2019 and in a bottle at Porter Beer bar. Amazing balance of sweet, sour, and funk from a knock punch of Cherries to the palate. Would have a third time if I see it up north.	5
3555	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Batch 6.. A- 500ml bulbous bottle to a snifter with a deep cherry red body. A half finger foam pink cap with little retention. Lacing spots are rare.. S- A boatload of cherries. Fresh black and red cherries, cherry jam, herbal fruit stems and leaves and some lactic tartness. A touch of funk and vinous oak..  774 characters	4.17
3556	Montmorency Vs Balaton	500 ml bottle. Pours deep cherry red, a little cloudy. White lacing for a head.. Aroma is of mild cereal malts and hints of citrus over a tart cherry..  395 characters	4.49
3557	Montmorency Vs Balaton	"$ 25.43 (Including shipping and PA tax)/500 mL bottle ($ 0.762/oz) from Tavour, Seattle, WA. Reviewed 8/23/19.
“Bout Six February 2019” on back label. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 45 degrees in a hand-washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Cerise pink, clear.
Body – Between barn red and maroon, opaque. When held to the light, maroon and translucent.
Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), pink, dense but fizzy, gone nearly concurrent with the end of the pour, leaving a few tiny bubbles as a partial crown, and no cap. Continuous effervescence feeds the crown.
Lacing – None
Aroma – 4.25 – Cherry.
Flavor – 4.5 - Begins and ends with tart cherries, no hops, no malt, no alcohol (6.1% ABV) flavor or aroma, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl. A bit of the tartness may come from the tannic acid from the barrel aging, but the barrel is otherwise not noticed.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium, watery, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation – 4.5 - After missing the first five years of this blend, I’ve finally been able to grab a couple of bottles! And I’m not disappointed!"	4.31
3558	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Appearance - The beer poured from the bottle a hazy reddish pink color with white bubbles crowning the glass.. Smell - The nose radiated fresh cherries. It was more tart than sweet, but amazingly fresh.. Mouthfeel - as with my notes about the smell, the taste was fresh cherries. The leaning was more tart than sweet, but very pleasant. I would compare it to cherry preserves. The overall profile was a little more acidic than I would normally like, but the sweetness provided good balance. The taste was tart all the way through to the aftertaste..  813 characters	4.44
3559	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Montmorency vs Balaton is one of the best cherry sours I've ever had. Look: dark red with brown tint with a very quickly disappearing head. Aroma: lot's of cherry, maybe some red wine.  330 characters	4.55
3560	Montmorency Vs Balaton	500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 5, bottled in 5/2018. Pours fairly hazy deep reddish orange/amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy pink head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing eventually. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge sour/tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of leathery/musty Brett funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Amazing aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of cherries, fruity/funky/acidic/spicy yeast, wine barrels, and moderate pale/wheat malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge sour/tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of leathery/musty Brett funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness, fruit tang, and yeast/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, white bread, light funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of cherries, fruity/funky/acidic/spicy yeast, wine barrels, and moderate pale/wheat malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/tartness, tangy fruit, and yeast/oak spiciness balance; with no puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering tart/tang/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth and moderately grainy/acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 6.1%. Overall this is an amazing fruited sour/wild ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of cherries, fruity/funky/acidic/spicy yeast, wine barrels, and moderate pale/wheat malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly acidic/tangy/tannic/drying finish; not overly lactic/tannic. Amazing balance of super juicy/jammy cherries, and Brett/Bacteria complexity; great oak presence, and pale/wheat malt backbone against acidity. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing top tier quality style example as expected.	4.37
3561	Montmorency Vs Balaton	L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a bright, cherry red (duh) color and a hazy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy / fizzy, off white head that quickly dissipated. Not much lacing.. S: A very nice aroma of cherries, yeast, citrus fruit, an earthy quality, and some other berries.. T: Tasted of a hint of citrus fruit (lemon, orange, fleetingly), light raspberry notes (always nice), a ton of cherries (the dominant force, of course), a little yeast and a light earthiness. This is a tart, sweet, and surprisingly subtle flavor. It's not nearly as tart / sour as some wild ales, but it definitely has some force behind it. Tasty..  772 characters	4.28
3562	Montmorency Vs Balaton	"L - Nice translucent cherry red appearance, almost no head that lingers
S - Wonderful opening shot aroma of the cherries... layers of breadiness
T - Where this shines - like the champagne of cherry wild ales/sours - fantastic. Crispy, dry.
F - Great carbonated, fermented, bubbles here - crisp, gorgeous, finish ends with class.
O - one of the best wild ales I've had. Stunning."	4.36
3563	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Pours a deep burgundy with a ruby pink foamy head. Head retention is good. Aroma is cherries - big and bold. There is a little lactic tartness, but it's smoothed over by the cherry sweetness. Hints of rye bread and earthy malts and hops round it out. Flavor profile is cherry puree. Woah. Hints of lemon, lime, and yeast smooth and balance it out, but the storyline is cherries. Mouth feel is medium with a fuzzy, velvety texture that makes for playful sips. Overall, big cherries with a tightly controlled saison underneath. Really well done.. Served from the bottle at Jester King. Reviewed on Beers by BeerAdvocate.	4.47
3564	Montmorency Vs Balaton	"Got to have this last week at the Hops & Pie Sourfest 2019 in Denver, Colorado. What an epic day of drinking that was. You know what I liked there more than any other American beer? This one.. Pours a light reddish/purple and pink- color with 1/3"" lighter pink head. The aroma is heavy on the cherry, quite nice. Go Balaton!. Taste, wow, just wow. Feels like they used 3lbs of cherry per gallon or some absurd metric conveying a shit ton of cherries. So much cherry, but there isn't an equally thick viscous cold medicine like feel to it. They draft up a relatively innocuous body for the beer. A lot of beers talk about their pie like qualities but this one pushes cherry pie weight like no other. Any acidity is restrained as can be. Oak is mild, spontaneous funk notes are as well. Easily my favorite Jester King beer, and there have been a few excellent ones along with this one. Good cherry skin and pit dryness complimenting it all the way down..  1,057 characters"	4.53
3565	Montmorency Vs Balaton	"Look: Pours a vibrant pink color with minimal head
Smell: Cherries, a touch of oak, and some acidity
Taste: Follows the nose, tons of cherries. There is a good amount of tartness to this beer as well, with just a little bit of the barrel coming through on the end.
Feel: Fairly light, good carb level, if anything a bit low but works in this beer
Overall: This beer is a great example of cherry in a beer. But it doesn't do much else. It somewhat one noted and a bit on the tart side. It's a nice sipper that may not quite live up to the hype for me."	4.07
3566	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Look: The beer pours a cranberry juice color. Light pink head that leaves no lacing, but a thin film across the top of the beer and a thick ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Crimson. Dark, but translucent. No visible carbonation.. Smell: Sweet cherry pie. The fruit compote and flakey crust. Slight cherry acidity. Cherry skin. Floral aromatics. A slight mustiness. Flares of manure seem to come and go. Touch of melted plastic.. Taste: Upfront the beer has a cherry sweetness and manageable lemon acidity that hits the tip of the tongue. As the beer washes over the back and sides of my palate the two cherries truly fight it out. Cherry pie sweetness competes with bracing and gritty cherry acidity. All natural flavors. It reminds me of randomly pulling a sweet or tart cherry from the plastic container and being surprised. You get both here. The finish is very dry, and as the beer lingers on my palate I get some C. Howard Violet Chewing Gum. Quite floral and a bit powdery. A faint hint of herbal, earthy bitterness on the very end..  1,446 characters	4.75
3567	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Look – A dark ruby red color with a surprising amount of sediment. Nice head and good lacing.. Smell – Has a very nice Raspberry scent. It's not overly sour (I dislike too much sourness in wild ales).. Taste – Raspberry flavor with just a touch of sour. It's a really great lambic.  549 characters	4.44
3568	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Bout Six/February 2019 bottle.. Pouring from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a wine glass, this beer pours out a light pink color and forms in the glass a color resembling a rose. It has sea foam pink bubbles that are noisily popping the whole way through the pour.. The nose brings a very real cherry element; tamed and subtle. It has a slight acidity. I like the realness aspect but it does seem to be underwhelming overall in the nose..  1,094 characters	4.32
3569	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Poured a deep red fruit punch color with no head. Aroma is very sweet and juicy with heavy notes of tart cherries. Even picking up the sweet maraschino cherries from the jar. Not much barrel character though. Then at first sip, it starts dry but as it warms up, it immediately showcase the sweet, juicy tart cherries. Very fruity, like sweetened cherry juice added. The sour is is not too harsh, allowing the sweet malt to carry through, making the beer almost drink like candy. There is heavy carbonation that oddly seems to reduce at room temp. Overall, a very approachable sour that doesn’t fall short on the added cherries!	4.5
3570	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Blend 3. Nice cinnamon to the nose - slightly unexpected in a cherry beer. Rich and thicker than most cherry beers - none of the thin cough syrup that I've come to expect from cherry fruit beers and sours. Light barrel notes. Quite good. Really bucks expectations - I like this beer as much because of how it surprises me as how genuinely good it is!	4.5
3571	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Red Session. Bright pink color. Aroma has juicy cherries and acidic fruit juice. Taste is really dry, mineral with wet stone flavor. Fruity but not too intense with light cherry pit notes.	3.9
3572	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Red pour, smaller pinkish head, small globs of lace. Tart cherry aroma and taste, mild cherry pie, fruit juice. Light to medium body, cherry pie aftertaste.	4.25
3573	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Pours a clear amber with little to no head (ok no head). Aroma is juicy cherry (very layered), some nuttiness underneath. Flavor is tangy and cherry forward, with more tart cherry. Clean and crisp, somewhat light body. Tasty sour!	4.14
3574	Montmorency Vs Balaton	"Blend #3.. A: In low-light, it looks magenta, deep violet with some red hues thrown in. In proper lights, it's reversed, a bright ruby red with just a touch of something darker in there. Pretty much no head on the pour, save for a few stray bubbles and a thin, persistent ring of foam clinging to the edge of the glass. Looks like cherry juice.. S: Wow. A smack in the face with... wait... is that clove? And tons of cinnamon?! Wintery spice explodes out of the glass, accompanying a more expected blast of bright, ripe cherry. The two aren't necessarily disjoint--it's like pureed cherry baked with those spices, dare I say cherry pie?! Seriously, though, that is by far the dominant aroma in this. There's some other ""funkier"" scents deeper down... Maybe a hint of wood, something verrry lightly barnyard-y. But way more cherry and dessert-like than I expected. Really hope taste follows........  2,170 characters"	4.57
3575	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Cherry red appearance with reddish head that desipates quickly. Aroma is a slightly sour cherry. Taste is a dry cherry with a little bitterness that has plenty of carbination.	4.43
3576	Montmorency Vs Balaton	"Look: Red with a purple hue. Tiny head that recedes quickly.
Smell: Cherries, jam, and raspberries.
Taste: Cheerries, tart, funk, and jam.
Mouthfeel: Complex.
Overall: Excellent sour from Jester King."	4.52
3577	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Batch 3, poured into a taster. Tart cherries well balanced with a natural cherry-pie sweetness and a bit of spice and oak. Very well integrated and clean...highly recommended.	4.67
3578	Montmorency Vs Balaton	Not impressed with this given the hype. Nice cherry flavor, but not too intense, mildly tart, a little barrel. It's well balanced with no off flavors, but nothing jumps out.	4
3579	No Rules	2015 vintage; drank 8/12/16 @ the Yarchives.. Brown/black appearance.. Minimal dark tan head; minimal lace..  342 characters	4
3580	No Rules	"Orange ball!
Looks like a big stout- jet black, tan head, not much retention or lace
Smells like dark fruit, rosewater, hard candy, and a bit of chocolate
Tastes like sweet dark rum, maple, a bit of coconut, a bit buttery, hint of chocolate, too sweet for me
Hefty mouthfeel and low carbonation. Pretty damn sticky
If you like drinking creme liqueurs, this would be pretty good. I like drinking beer"	3.07
3581	No Rules	Bottle aged a year. I like some sugar but hate the overly sweet that still seem to score pretty high. This brew was the sweetest thing I've liked. Interesting. Bravo.	4.5
3582	No Rules	A- Pours truly like motor oil with a body as dark as darkness itself and a small brown cap. The frothy foam slowly falls and lacing is sparse with some webs and sheets.. S- The dark roasty grains really shine here with deep cocoa powder, pure roast barley, espresso and char notes. With warmth the barrel and coconut open up quite a bit but in the end the aroma is rather balanced. Toasty coconut, oaky vanilla, smooth bourbon, milk chocolate, slight dried dark fruits, sugar and toffee.. T- This is a big boy. Honestly doesn't drink even close to 15% with the coconut and roasted grains coming out as the main flavors in the brew. Luscious toasted coconut and medium dark chocolate leads into vanilla oak bourbon, dark roast coffee, charred grain, toffee, slight dark dry fruits, toasted nuts, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla bean, fresh toasted woody oak and peppery whiskey..  1,144 characters	4.49
3583	No Rules	2016 bottle. L - 1.5 finger dense hazelnut head atop a pitch black body.. S - caramel, bourbon, coconut, chocolate. Yum..  384 characters	4.36
3584	No Rules	The look is much the same as any oily slick, pitch black stout. Minimal tan mocha head with lacing like a mother. The nose is CO CO NUT. Fuck I hate coconut, it’s more of a texture thing so the rest isn’t so bad. But that’s definitely all there is on the scent of this one, it covers up any chocolate or coffee that may be lying beneath it cold. The taste is YUUUGE coconut up front which is followed closely by decadent sweet chocolate, light roast coffee, and some lactose. Mouthfeel is decadent, not quite chewy, but nosing right up to it. Overall this is fantastic, they hit the nail on the head and I can appreciate that even if I don’t necessarily like coconut.	4.51
3585	No Rules	I find this beer to be like John Mayer. Is your body a wonderland? I dunno. Great aroma, great taste, but the body... yeah, a work in progress like your little brother that is in his 4th year of undergrads.. I think I’m lifted.	4.24
3586	No Rules	"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. Purple bowling ball (2016 bottle).. A: Very dark brown, nicely opaque, with a thin tan head that fades to a ring along the sides. Low visible carbonation.. S: Big bourbon up front, with less, but still big, oakiness. As the bourbon punch fades the coconut, vanilla, and chocolate malts show up. Roasted malts, cacao, mild char, and dark roasted coffee. Light tobacco as well. Definitely booze-forward, but yet still not a particularly ""alcoholic"" smell. Really nice here..  1,692 characters"	4.24
3587	No Rules	2016 purple ball. Sweet coconut milk. This is really sweet; probably due to addition of turbinado sugar in addition to the coconut. Slight alcohol burn on the back end. One dimensional pure coconut with a slick mouthfeel that lingers. Very enjoyable.	4.26
3588	No Rules	"Bought in 16oz bomber. Color: Black as the soul
Smell: Delicious. If this beer was a candle, I'd buy a crate of them. Coconut and vanilla
Taste: Coconut, caramel, vanilla. Bourbon flavor is wonderfully subtle. Sweet. Aftertaste is pleasant. Minimal bitterness. Overall: SMOOOOOOOTH and sweet (with a capital S). Not overly boozy. Easy to pound and crush.
A new favorite."	5
3589	No Rules	"Orange Bowling Ball. Poured into a KBS extended tulip.
Syrupy almost-black body that is steadfast in its presence. Mocha brown head starts strong, tapers down and settles into a good routine with a decent layer that clumps and drifts even moreso along the edges. Some intermittent lacing.. Very sweet off the bat and an almost burnt character. Some nutty/roasty coconut husk, but I'm not really getting any of the meat/*coconut* coconut that I was looking for. Fleeting touches of licorice and almost cinnamon (but like... candy cinnomon. Red hots, not actual cinnamon sticks)drift by. Interestingly I don't feel like there's a lot of the classic PORTER flavours jumping out either... mainly the sugar and some woody/nutty husk. I'm actually pretty underwhelmed by the aroma.. Ah, now that's more what I was looking for. Well, first the two things that jump out right off the bat are that it is very sweet and there's a lot of alcohol. This is definitely 15%. Moving beyond these broad strokes, we focus in and find sweet candied coconut (think mounds bar) with creamy cocoa. Blends into bourbon notes of vanilla and caramel and just a faint hint of mash before committing again to its sugary beginnings.
Finish carries the sugar sweetness but leaves the coconut primarily on the back burner, leaving hints of creamy chocolate and a little bit of coffee and maaaybe char just peeking in at the edges. Final note brings back some of the bourbon mash..  1,924 characters"	4.03
3590	No Rules	"2015 vintage
22oz bottle poured into a tulip. A- pours a deep brown color with a one-finger creamy khaki head that reduces to a thin film floating on top, some lacing left behind. S- big malty nose with caramel & toffee leading the way, along with lots of dark fruity aromas of raisin & fig. Undertones of coconut and brown sugar are definitely noticeable. Not picking up much barrel aroma except some earthy wood.  1,028 characters"	4.39
3591	No Rules	22 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2017 edition, had 1/6/18.. Pours dark, opaque, with no real head and some spotty lacing. Smells of roasted malt, molasses, bourbon, cocoa, coffee, some coconut, light toffee. A light sweet aroma. Smells great. The taste is less roasted malt than the nose, also lighter bourbon, coconut, coffee, chocolate, some oak, light caramel, a solid sweet note. Tastes pretty great, too. Really smooth for the very high ABV, a solid medium to full body, well carbonated.. Great blend of flavors and aromas, the Turbinado sugar and coconut star. Lighter bourbon than I recall from 2016, but only had a taste of that one. This is one you want to try annually, if you get the chance.	4.49
3592	No Rules	Look: Dark cola brown with a thin line around the rim of a head. No activity.. Smell: Heavy and cloying on the nose. Sweet. Let’s of dark chocolate, coconut, bourbon, alcohol, a hint of cinnamon, condensed milk, and more chocolate.. Taste: Much like the nose. Heavy on the palate. Milk chocolate, dates, honey, cola, coconut, a kiss of cinnamon, big smooth bourbon, and a big if smooth alcohol..  644 characters	4.3
3593	No Rules	"One of those beers that, upon first sip, totally stopped me in my tracks and had me lean back in the couch and just say - ""wow."" Delicious beer. Simply delicious.. Not sure of the bottling variations or release date but this Vietnamese Coffee version was picked up in Ohio during Thanksgiving, stored appropriately since and enjoyed three months later. I'm never too concerned with some age on coffee beers as most hit me as being a little to acidic.. Coal-black pour with a thin head that fades quickly to fait wisps of brown bubbles. On par with the normal look of the style..  1,326 characters"	4.61
3594	No Rules	Pour is black, leaking to dark mahogany on the edges, and a tan head. HUUUUGE barrel notes up front, then oak and coconut aromas follow.. The barrel is prominent on the taste, but the oak and coconut mellow it a bit. The star of the show, though, is the turbinado sugar, which adds sweetness (duh) to the beer, but also depth and balance that really elevates this.	4.5
3595	No Rules	Purple Bowling Ball, so 2016. Consumed on 2/9/2018.. Jet black beer in a glass, tiny head.. Straight brown sugar on the nose. Almost a milky type sweetness (you will need to try to understand)..  576 characters	4
3596	No Rules	Purple bowling ball so it must be the 2016 version. This one has been on my once list for a very long time so I am very excited to try it. The smell is very much like German chocolate cake. The sweetness of this beer is something that really grips you right off the bat. Smooth astringent, cordial like alcohol blends nicely with cocoa and chocolate icing. This brew is very cake like throughout. Lots of dark chocolate with hints of black cherry. I would love to try maybe a rye barrel aged version of this.	4.44
3597	No Rules	Diabetes in a Bomber, Schedule you dialysis appt. before you drink this. Way, way too sweet, if like myself, you like B.A stouts that pours like 50W motor in January.. If I had to use two words....Pixie Stick	3.47
3598	No Rules	Appearance: initially very thin when poured, which, strangely, transforms into a thick, luxurious and silky 30-weight. No carbonation or head; nearly flat in appearance. However, for they style of this beer – or rather for what this beer is – I think the addition of a head would be detrimental to its appearance. The beer coats the glass when poured, and recedes slowly down the glass (legs).. Aroma: heavy oak in the nose, sweet smelling. Light bourbon, molasses and raisins.. Flavor: holy shit is this sweet! It’s almost on par with drinking natural maple syrup. This is so sweet, I can’t imagine serving it anytime other than desert. That said, the beer is very good – though no more than a snifter in volume. This beer is sweet and complex like certain types of custard or a sticky bun perhaps. This beer doesn’t yield any cinnamon flavors, but each sip conjures thoughts of cinnamon. Maybe that is where the custard and sticky bun come from. Brown sugar, light molasses, raisins and oak. Light alcohol in the flavor but no heat, although there is a light warmth in the finish. Despite the bourbon barrel aging, this beer more resembles a brandy..  1,562 characters	4.32
3599	No Rules	12/7/17: Monk's Pub 10 oz pour into snifter. Dark black pour, bourbon aroma. Rye, bourbon, somewhat sweet taste, chocolate subtle. Thin, mild carbonation, very smooth going down. Overall good beer!	3.83
3600	No Rules	Woah this is huge for a porter. Vanilla, oak, bourbon. The coconut hints are small but this is a very complex beer. I love it. Wouldn't change anything about it. The world needs more porters like it.	5
3601	No Rules	Medium roast coffee poured over sticky highly frosted cinnamon roles with hints of coconut creamer. Topped with a hint of alcohol notes. I don't think I've ever been more descriptive with so few words or literal.. Dark roasted stout (they call it a porter?) looks, and finishing notes.. Anyway overall really dessert like beverage. I'll decline on another bottle at 14. It's interesting and certainly out there.	3.73
3602	No Rules	"Dear Lord. This is straight up, AMAZIng!!! Purple Ball = 2016 vintage
Thanks to @rypkr for putting this on my radar, and in my hands.
This deep dark brew brings a khaki head and the most glorious nose. Toasted sugars, deep, rich malts. Not quite chocolate, not cloying sweetness... just a deep round sweetness with a hint of toast.
Flavor carries a rich, round, full slightly roasted sweetness, that backs off on the roast. Subtle hues of toasted coconut peek through. But overall, it's hard to nail down all of the beauty herein.
Mouthfeel is plentiful for a porter."	4.51
3603	No Rules	"2016 into a snifter. Pours lighter but with good head and lacing
Smell is actually sweet coconut and, well sugar
Taste is all sugar. Diabetes in a bottle here. Not getting anything except sweetness...
Feel is thickened by the sugar - nice heft to it. Overall a sugar bomb. Not balanced and flavor/barrel character completely obliterated by the sugar. At a tasting this would stand out. Into a snifter it's a terribly flawed beer"	3.05
3604	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Got this one from Gary and Carrie this past summer. Thanks, guys!. From a 16oz can into a pint glass. APPEARANCE: A hazy pour yields a two finger, medium looking, frothy, slightly foamy white head with good retention. A cloudy, muddy amber orange with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a faint cap and leaves some foamy lacing on the glass. A decent wisp remains until the end leaving touches of lacing on the glass as it empties..  1,275 characters	4.19
3605	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	A weird airy spit bubble head quickly dies off in fits and starts over an opaque Tang and mango puree looking dark neon orange body.. Spicy, peppery and dank allium pairs with tropical citrus and a hint of cracker. The hop overload brings an acidic sharpness.. The medium-thin body is crisp and finishes paper dry with a little heat and a piney aspirin bitterness.	3.84
3606	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Beautiful pour of milky orange, medium head and lots of lacing. Nose is grapefruit juice, a bit of resin. Flavor has the hop resin more forward, with herbal notes over a powerful pith core. The finish is surprisingly mild, given the grapefruit emphasis. Tasty and beautiful.	4.5
3607	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	I picked up several cans and the beer is almost perfect. The fruit taste and aroma stand out. I loved the beer but the staff at the Canton location were not friendly. A simple thank you would have gone a long way to enhance the experience.. Note that the staff at the Greenway Beer Garden location were professional and friendly.	4.91
3608	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Simply slathered with Mosaic hop character, the uniqueness of Melcher Street New England styled IPA by Trillium doesn't stop with simple brewing techniques, but rather a double dry hopping addition of the coveted hops for extra tangy, green and fruity complexity.. The Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street pours with a standard yeast extract appearance on a goldenrod backdrop. As a rich ivory froth builds on top, the perfume of succulent tropical fruit, citrus and herbal notes swoon the nose. The taste jumps right out with a shortbread type of bready sweetness that hinges on light caramel, honey and a slight cakey texture.. And then the true and radiant character of Mosaic hops shines on the middle palate and once the sweet maltiness begins to recede. Strong overtones of passionfruit, under ripened orange, gooseberry and lime show off the unique charm of the hops with a tangy, green fruit citrus and tropical medley. Trending peppery, botanical and nearly tangy, a grass filled late palate sheds the light on sassafras, white grapefruit, green tea, hemp and verbena..  1,367 characters	4.49
3609	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	"A: Murky orange/ gold with rich white head and great lacing.
N: Very fresh citrus, hops, pine, and malt.
T: Follows the nose, very nice citrus hit with smooth hops, some resin hit, slight malt and melon notes.
M: Medium
O: Really great beer, loads of flavor and ultra smooth with just a hit of bitterness to round it out."	4.35
3610	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Dive Bar, Worcester, MA.. A- Draft into a goblet with a hazy golden yellow body and a inch creamy head. Good retention and tons of lacing in sheets.. S- Big hop quota in the Trillium way. Fresh citrus and stone fruits stick out with tropical, herbal and floral. Ripe mango, apricot, peach, grapefruit, zesty oranges, creamsicle and pineapple..  926 characters	4.28
3611	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	L - 1-finger sparse bright white head atop a milky orange body.. S - tangerine, pineapple, herb, grapefruit. Yes!. T - very tropical. More tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit, plus melon, cotton candy, a bit of dank, a slight earthiness. Smooth middle. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Low booziness..  399 characters	4.23
3612	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Canned on 10/9/18. Pours a bright, deeply hazy orange with over a finger of semi-thick, pillowy white head; decent retention with fair bits of lacing trickling around the glass.. Aromas of creamy orange, candied pineapple, melon, bits of fresh grass and light, plush herbal tones; the citrus punch to this bouquet is level, pointedly hoppy, and incredibly enjoyable and easy to nose..  1,112 characters	4.3
3613	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Had this on 2018-10-31 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2018-10-09. A - Very hazy orange with a 1/3-finger white head and good lace.. S - Melon, pineapple, peach, orange, biscuit, mildly dank. Sweet and inviting..  620 characters	4.42
3614	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Pours an opaque orange with nearly two fingers of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, papaya, pine, dank, and tangerine, mingling tropical fruit juice with biting Northwest hops. Wheaty, biscuity, toasty malts shine through in the middle. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, peach, pine, and light dank. Aside from the abundant hops, wheat and biscuity malts show through. Mouth feel is lightly effervescent with a chalky, grainy texture. It has a medium viscosity. Overall, flavorful and dense, bit less juicy and smooth from other Trillium offerings.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.	4.46
3615	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Looks great and smells OK but compared to DDH Fort Point this is kind of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Stillings Street, this was the worst of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!	4.17
3616	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	3 days old. Frothy and hazy. Sweet citrus, honey, resin - juicy. Taste is sweet with tons of light malt. Grapefruit and honey. Hardly any bitterness. Legitimately one of the best IPAs I've had	4.86
3617	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned July 30th 2018.. Frothy and sudsy off white tall reaching nearly four finger tall head. Slight swiss cheese bubbles in its makeup, and a slow dissolve. Mild turbid body, a bit brown dull with a hint of lifeless sense to it and dull lemon yellow as well. Faint soapy cling to the glass.. Aroma is dank earth and a soft sense of malt. Hints in the weedy range quite easily but is rather one dimensional but a good simple one..  1,362 characters	4.15
3618	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Tropical tropical tropical! Great hazy IPA. Pours with a thick head that retains. Smooth and not at all bitter. I get a very small touch of dryness at the end of the taste. But all around this is a fantastic beer and one of my favorites. No complaints with this beer at all.	5
3619	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Appearance: Pours cloudy and goldenstraw color with a thick two fingers of foam; webby lacing and good retention. Smell: Melon, pineapple, papaya, tangerine and a hint of green onion. Taste: Pineapple and tangerine forward, with melon and papaya undertones; a growing bitterness, through the middle, with the pine tones emerging to produce a somewhat dry and biting finish.  473 characters	4.27
3620	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Tasted in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a one pint can on May 14, 2018. A double dry hopped version of Melcher Street this amped up American IPA features a heavy dose of Mosaic hops. The spicy, resinous, herbal aroma bursts with nuances of tart citrus, tangerine, clementine and subtle green onion. Bold flavors of under-ripe melon, cantaloupe rind, and pineapple are highlighted with gentle bitterness and delicate, biscuity malt character. Awesome.	4.5
3621	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	16 oz canned 2/28/18 delivered into an IPA glass. A hazy orange with active carbonation, a three finger white head that rises before receding. Pine, earth, and tropical fruit on the nose. The taste retains the dirt, some of the citrus/fruit elements, pine/mint, and grains. The feel is soft, carbonation medium low. Had this and Sleeper street, each a little different, but definitely recommended.	4.2
3622	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Pours a murky yellow to orange with a billowy white head on heavy pour. Nose is citrus driven. Orange juice, grapefruit peel and tangerine. Taste follows nose. Very citrus forward with notes of ripe tropical fruit and earthy tones of malt grasses and dankness. Medium bodied with a light carbonation bit. Finishes crisp and dry. Enjoyed DDH Melcher Street.	4.49
3623	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Tied for first in a blind taste test with 7 similar ABV IPAs. A lot going on with Fruity fruity tastes on the front end and some butter dankness on the finish.	4.66
3624	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	16 oz. can dated 4/4/18, purchased from brewery. Poured into Belgian ale glass.. L: Hazy golden-orange. Nice 3F fluffy head upon pour, good retention, leaves soapy lacing and a cap and ring.. S: Lots of orange-related citrus - I'd like to go with tangelo, please - and some earthy dankness with a hint of ripe tropical fruit..  663 characters	4.28
3625	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Been drinking Trillium from the get-go; been drinking NE IPAs before it had a name. My palate is toast at this point, but even still - this is the most tropical, fruit-forward, resiny, pungent IPA out there. Looking for low bitterness and a humongous tropical fruit-taste? This is your beer.	4.27
3626	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	Look: comes in a beautiful straw gold color. Bright white head. There wasn’t much head retention.. Smell: Up front you get huge bursts of pineapple, mango, tangerine, ruby red grapefruit juice, some papaya and unripened melon. You are then hit with the classic mosaic berry note and dankness. Some onion and pepper in there as well. The aroma is absolutely outstanding.. Taste: up front you are hit with all of those tropical and passion fruit from the aroma and then right away you are hit with a huge, almost chemical tasting dankness. You also get the onion/pepper taste left in your mouth. Medium bitterness on the finish. The taste is not as balanced as the aroma, and the back end is alittle too overpowering with that chemical tasting note. Still very nice overall..  852 characters	4.56
3627	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	On draft at Trillium-Canton taproom. This has all the color and appearance of orange juice. I had this after Scaled Way Up, and this was a bit more citrus juicy (as opposed to tropical fruit) than Scaled Way Up. But it was also sweeter and smoother on the end (not as dry as Scaled Way Up).	4.58
3628	Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped)	"16oz can, dated 8.24.17, poured into a Trillium Permutation Series stemmed glass. Enjoyed on 9.11.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a turbid copper color with orange hues and a fizzy white head that offers little retention and little lacing. The aroma is pleasant, super green hops, definitely getting that Trillium ""overhop"" aroma, a floral bouquet helps to soften things up, but there is also a nice amount of citrus and pineapple forward tropical fruits to keep things interesting and forgive the punishingly bitter and piney green hops. The flavors are nice, juicy and tropical, lots of fresh fruit flavors though as it warms, the greener, earthier and pinier flavors start to develop and dominate the beer. A soft bed of pale grain offers little in terms of balance, but does add a nice flavor to the finish with offers some mineral water as well. The mouthfeel is good, bone dry medium body, chewy but with a bit of a lively prickle as it finishes which is bitter and dry.. Verdict: A good IPA from Trillium. The aroma is pretty intensely green and harsh, but the flavors really open up and develop into a very refreshing and rewarding beer."	3.88
3629	Everett Porter	Smells of chocholate with some coffee flavors. This beer is definitely bitter and embodies the true porter feeling. It's not sweet at all. Robust, and a good portrayal of this style.	4.5
3630	Everett Porter	poured from a 500mL bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a deep black with mocha colored head that settles into a thin film on top and leaves lacing as the beer is consumed. beautiful looking beer. smells chocolatey and smoky with a hint of hops. taste is similar with a dry, hoppy finish. feel is decent, especially so for a porter. overall, fantastic rendition of the style and extremely flavorful and drinkable for such a dark beer.	4.49
3631	Everett Porter	Classic, oldschool porter - quite hoppy, very roasty, lots of bitter, dark chocolate. It's not tremendously thick, but you don't expect that from a porter.	3.96
3632	Everett Porter	Bottled 2/24/16; drank 5/13/16 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Brown/black appearance.. Big, noisy tan head; nice lace..  417 characters	4.5
3633	Everett Porter	Dark and thick for a porter. Dense creamy tan head. Smells roasty and sweet with coffee, malt and chocolate. Tastes like it smells with a nice bitter finish. This is an amazing porter.	5
3634	Everett Porter	"Yeah, this was my first HF beer. After trying it, I must admit that I understand why people consider HF the best brewery in the world. Here goes:. 
A: Pitch black; huge, white head that lingers. The head leaves great lacing. Against the snowy backdrop, the beer certainly looks spectacular.. S: Absolutely perfect. Tons of chocolate; milk-chocolate and dark-chocolate sweetness; surprised if the beer doesn't contain any lactose. Burnt malts give the smell a coffee profile, too. Absolutely stunning..  739 characters"	4.99
3635	Everett Porter	Look: Very dark black color with a small amount of dark tan head. Decent lacing.. Smell: Getting a ton of chocolate malts and coffee, followed by the slight hint of vanilla and some dark fruit notes.. Taste: Coffee is big and dominant when cold. As it warms the more chocolate taste there is and a decent amount of vanilla flavors..  477 characters	4.61
3636	Everett Porter	A: Pours pitch black with a mocha colored head. Head is quite creamy looking with decent retention. Average lacing. Good looking but nothing special.. S: Well, this smells like a very traditional but intense porter. There are chocolate malts, coffee notes (but not espresso), leather, pecans, vanilla and some very light cherries. This a dark, round and complex smelling porter.. T: If the smell made me think of coffee without being espresso, the taste really puts the espresso right in the front and center. There is cacao powder, vanilla, leather, cherries (much stronger than in the smell), oak like tannins, pecans and a little bit of earth. The balance is wonderful and with very little residual sweetness..  1,294 characters	4.51
3637	Everett Porter	Appearance - The beer poured a very dark brown color with an off white head.. Smell - The beer had a big bold roasty color.. Taste - The initial taste was the big bold malts accompanied by coffee. Toward the back, there were nice hints of burnt sugar and perhaps caramel. The malts stayed strong throughout.  476 characters	4.28
3638	Everett Porter	Pouring from a 500 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out dark brown and forms black in the glass. It forms one finger worth of dense and creamy caramel colored crown. The smell is roastiness with some hop presence almost bringing a resin element into the mix. The taste brings a creamy note into the roastiness, while still delivering that hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy. This reminds me a lot of Pappys Porter. Must be something about Vermont.	4.38
3639	Everett Porter	Appearance - Pours jet black with big fluffy mocha colored head that leaves tons of lacing all around the glass.. Aroma - Big coffee, roasted malt, char, rich milk chocolate, light vanilla, very bold and rich.. Taste - good bit more smoke on the taste than the nose, coffee, roasted malts, decadent chocolate flavor it is almost like a smoked chocolate dessert. light vanilla on the finish the roastiness carries on and on..  605 characters	4.51
3640	Everett Porter	"On tap at Beer Shop, NYC.
Pours a thick, viscous dark brown/mahogany with hints of ruby. Modest creamy head that quickly dissipates, leaves a thin ring of lacing.
Nutty, chocolate and cocoa, coffee and roasted malt aroma. Also, a touch of alcohol and dark fruit.
Complex taste that masterfully alternates between the sweetness of the chocolate malts, dark caramel, dark fruit and the bitterness of the espresso roast and earthy hops. Bright and creamy finish that is also sticky, dry and bitter.
Full bodied, rich, robust, yet easy to drink. Smooth and creamy.
Wonderful porter that feels bigger than its 7.50% ABV."	4.5
3641	Everett Porter	Pours a twilight brown, half inch of creamy head, good retention. Aroma is a very smooth roasted malt, milk chocolate, espresso beans and creme fraiche. Taste is simple but evocative - the malt backbone is deceptively clean, highlighting that roasted malt flavor perfectly, elements of cappuccino, foam latte, burnt nut and pumpernickel. One of the best porters out there	4.72
3642	Everett Porter	"Served on tap in a 10 oz (296 ml) snifter at Beer Noggin in Bronxville, NY.
A: Pours an opaque, very dark brown to nearly black color with a mocha brown head with limited retention (in that style of glass, but modest soapy lacing.
S: Malty with aromas of milk chocolate >> coffee and molasses.
T: Sweet with a flavor melange of dark chocolate and black coffee. Maybe a blackberry note. Light bitterness offsets any excessive sweetness.
M: Full bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy, feels substantive on the palate.
O: Really a delicious porter, almost a stout. Very enjoyable."	4.55
3643	Everett Porter	"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro. L — Quite deep black for a porter. Tiny tan head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Just a bit of spotty glass lacing
S — Dark chocolate, cold brew coffee, barley malt, apple peel, hint of caramel
T — Lots of well-roasted barley, bittersweet chocolate, char, dark roast coffee, bitter hops. Touch of brown sugar as well. Easily the most roast-forward porter I’ve had to date
F — Big mouthfeel, medium carb. Mouthfeel doesn’t jump off the palate as much as it could. Has that signature Hill Farmstead effervescence of remarkably tiny bubbles
O — An interesting offer from Hill Farmstead that definitely doesn’t fall into the common issue with many porters of being too thin/watery in the mouthfeel. Sadly the flavors and aromas are fairly nondescript and lack a certain ‘character’. 81/100"	4.04
3644	Everett Porter	In review is a 2012 vintage from the cellar.. A - Very dark brown pour that's borderline black, thick and creamy caramel colored lacing. Thick and viscous on the sides of the glass with lots of legs.. S - Nose is dominated by chocolate and cocoa with a slight hint of dark fruit..  614 characters	4.24
3645	Everett Porter	Enjoying a 2013 vintage obtained in trade, which is apparently not recommended, but I still find it one of the best porters I've ever had. No signs of significant oxidation, and the floral hop character is extremely delicate, surrounded by dark chocolate, earthy cold-brew coffee, and oats. Moderately full body and luscious, silky mouthfeel. Perfect degree of carbonation and a light, medium-dry finish.	4.41
3646	Everett Porter	This is an extremely good beer. Drank it back-to-back with a 2018 Victory at Sea and in no way does this take a back seat. Dark brown, half-finger head with an aggressive pour. Perfect roasty nose. Not coffee, not shoe leather, not chocolate, maybe a combination of all three? Not sure but a very pleasant and unique aroma.. I love this beer. Medium mouth feel, equally superb after an hour in the refrigerator as it is as close to room temperature. Easily sessionable. goes great with semi-sweet chocolate. My can was about 4 months old. I've also consumed this extremely fresh, loses nothing with age although the can recommends to drink fresh.. Recommend highly and also recommend a trip to the brewery. Superb value at six 12-ounce cans for $16.	4.63
3647	Everett Porter	At last: Everett. After so many missed opportunities - here he sits, in a chilled growler not more than two weeks old. Welcome to my home, brother - please make yourself comfortable; we’ve saved you a seat.. Split two ways; enjoyed by all.. Pours a charcoal black with a cardboard-colored head that lingers. On par with the good looking crowd of the style. Neither outstanding nor detracting..  839 characters	4.51
3648	Everett Porter	12 oz. Can.. Pours or slides out with a total opaque blackness. Just about as thick and oily looking as any Imperial Porter or IRS.black liquid, mocha chunky foam cap, short, well retained with lace leftover. Plenty of bubbly suds for coverage.. The aroma is simply awesome! As complex as any RIS or Baltic porter. Dense, and I mean, heady chocolate, dark roasty coffee beans, vanilla, charred oats and grains, dark, wild berries, blueberry pie, rollo's, peanutbutter cups, sandy, wet grass hops under the intense malted barley grains and smoked sweetness..  1,128 characters	4.68
3649	Everett Porter	Out of the bottle, this pours a swiftly moving, slick but stark black ribbon, filling the glass with a thick and densly growing dark tan to mocha head that leaves some craggy lace.. Smell is chocolate milk as it pours from the bottle, but coming in closer it becomes very roasty, nearing smoky, and a little acidic, like as from coffee. Woody hops plus a touch of molasses and cedar take supporting roles. Everett really smells like a walk through the fall woods, where maybe a woodstove chimney billows away, far in the distance.. Taste is tangy and simple, yet multifaceted. Dark chocolate cut by woody hops. Deeply roasted malt with mocha coffee syrup. A bittering dark cocoa finish..  819 characters	4.14
3650	Everett Porter	Poured from a 500mL bottle into a Hill Farmstead bulb glass. December 2015 bottle purchased at the brewery.. Pours a deep brown body with a huge, fluffy cappuccino colored head that reduces slowly to leave great lacing and retention. This is what a porter should look like!. Aromas are coffee and chocolate heavy, cocoa and coffee grounds dominate. Taste is rich with coffee and roasty malts, milk chocolate, bittersweet bakers chocolate on the finish. Medium body and medium carbonation..  529 characters	4.22
3651	Everett Porter	Tasted from draft. Pours black with a beige soda like head. Aroma is dark chocolate, coffee, and tobacco. Taste is moderately bitter with mild malty sweet backbone. Flavors of coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and licorice. Pretty full bodied. Excellent porter.	4.53
3652	Everett Porter	I like Hill Farmstead's offerings, and it is certainly worth a stop at the brewery when I am in the Northeast Kingdom but... I had always considered them just one of the many excellent breweries here in Vermont. This weekend I had Everett, fresh, and my entire opinion of their enterprise changed. This is, quite simply, the best tasting thing that I have ever had... it is perfect in every dimension. The taste starts with chocolate and coffee and a glorious warmth sustains like the tone of a vintage Les Paul through an old tube amp.. I have never been this happy drinking a beer. Beyond perfection.	5
3653	Everett Porter	The appearance was a nice looking dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light lacing surrounded the glass, thick yet not too thick as it showed enough spliced delicate thin-ness to it (adequate). The smell started off with sweet to robust and roasty coffee and cocoa moving slowly into a real nice malty aroma. The taste rolled into the sweetness nicely with a fairly sweet to roasty with a tad of bitter coffee blending nicely. There’s a nice semi-sweet to roasty aftertaste bleeding into a semi-dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fairly nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nicely underneath fulfilling a fairly light quality but not too light. Overall, as an American Porter, it works. Its nice and definitely one to have this time of the year.	4.41
3654	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	16 oz can, dated 7/11/19, been in my fridge since then. hazy, mostly opaque medium yellow color, foamy white head. aroma is nice well rounded fruity hop aroma - orange, papaya, mango. taste is similar, somewhat sweet, but with an underlying medium bitterness. medium bodied.	4.04
3655	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	"This beers pours hazy orange with moderate white head. Not super thick hazy like some NE styles. But you can't see thru it.
Big smells of that vegetal onion mosaic pineapple that is typical from that hop. The flavor follows the nose. All Mosaic. Kind of disappointing because the dry hopping over powered the entire beer. It is a mosaic bomb unfortunately, and I do not love that hop.
Love the Galaxy version of this"	3.98
3656	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Canned on 05/06/19 and picked up at the Fort Point/Seaport brewery. Nose and flavor are inviting and delicious, with lots of those Mosaic qualities. Pine, pungent citrus fruit like mango, and fresh spring grassy goodness. Soooo smooth and creamy in the finish and feel. One of the finest examples of a properly-hopped APA with everything you look for in the style and in a craft beer in general. One of those beers you could drink every day without complaints.	4.65
3657	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Yeah, this is old as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/4/17 and yes, I have a ton of beer to get through here at my house. With that being said, I wasn't sure why this was rated so high. Maybe it's the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall, this was an average beer that didn't stand out in any particular way to me, even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time.... Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a deep apricot with enough fluffy head to top it off. Quite cloudy, only a bit of sediment floated in it and hardly any light got in around the edges. Very little soapy lacing was seen along the back of my pint glass as I worked my way through this, which was a bit of a surprise. Loads of Mosaic, dankness, grass, and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste. Nothing heavy here and the Barley stood out more than anything else in the taste, as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time. A lack of easily discernible bitterness stood out to me as this went right down and although it wasn't bad, it needed quite a bit more to stand out from Trillium's other offerings that I've had.. Not a lot of booze here either as this was the epitome of what a generic American Pale Ale is, in my eyes. I need to get a fresh can of this but given how well their other offerings have held up well over time, this one was a bit of a letdown. I prefer the regular Fort Point and know that it's me, and not them, when it comes to how low I rated this. Needs another go before I fully write it off!	3.78
3658	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	I've been on and off with mosaic for a few years now - I'm a fan of how soft it makes a beer, and Fort Point is no exception. This beer also exemplifies the mosaic effect - it's quite green and grassy, and while that's great, I am not sure that I get the hype. The beer is quite drinkable and tasty, but it's certainly no Citra-hopping.	3.68
3659	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Kids! Always bring back Trillium when you visit Boston! Like you didn’t know that. 16 oz. can dated 10/4/18.. The pour is thick, phlegm-like yellow that smells like grapefruit perfume cut with pine. Not bad.. Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point leans hard enough into grapefruit it might fall out of the car. Grapefruit for kilometers, kiwi, spring florals, touch of mint, with a nice bitter finish. Dry. Easy enough to drink, which might be its calling card..  714 characters	3.6
3660	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Thank you Jon for hooking me up with this one!. Pint can dated 10/04/18 pink dot. Poured into a tulip at 44f. Pours a pretty hazy, rich honey golden, with a fluffy, two-finger ever-so-slightly off-white head, slowly slinking down to small patchy islands of film, and a little collar. Some spotty lacing. Absolutely beautiful color..  1,956 characters	4.38
3661	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Another winner from Trillium, this looks good, smells delicious and has a ton of citrus notes that showcase grapefruit, clementine, guava, orange peel, lemon, tangerine, biscuit, toasted grains, faint caramel and piney notes. Well balanced and smooth, delicious as usual.	4.44
3662	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Very nice APA. Slightly pinkish in color and very fruity, with melon and passionfruit standing out on the nose and palate. Nice soft texture. Delicious and quaffable, though it escapes me why this beer is rated higher than many of their other IPAs and DIPAs on this website.	4.28
3663	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Can from the brewery in Fort Point in Boston, MA, whilst in town for EBF. Pours a hazy bright orange with a white fluffy head and soft lacing, smells like guava-peach grape must and pine resin dipped citrus candy, taste is biscuity malt sweetness with hints of nectarine and tangerine, finishes with a mildly bitter white wine mustiness, light bodied. A dry and fruity pale ale.	4.13
3664	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	This beer pours a cloudy, deep golden orange color with a creamy, frothy, bright white head. Retention is excellent and there are many webs and rings of lacing left on the glass.. Smell is grapefruit, herbal earthiness, lemon, tangerine and mango.. Taste follows suit, but the fruit mixed with the herbal, earthiness and bitterness seems to get muddled a little bit. It is still very good, but not as robust as the smell suggested..  645 characters	4.35
3665	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Canned 11/15. A nice murky honey-tea color with a tall, tall poofy head of 3 fingers. Tons of gobs of lace left behind.. Such a refreshing nose. Should be made into a summer candle. Effervescence of pear, spritzer, honey, apple, melon, and lemon float up to the nose in an ocean wave-like wafting. Ever so slight dank at the tail end of the nose.. Flavor is juicy, although I can tell it has faded just a touch as there's some notes that I can sense the shadow of but not quite full-on. Nice pineapple, banana peel, oranges, bubble gum, starfruit, and mango all form together for a soft but easy profile..  874 characters	4.35
3666	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	"A: Hazy yellow gold with nice white foamy head and sticky lacing.
N: Hops, citrus, floral, and biscuit.
T: Follows the nose, very clean and refreshing Pale Ale.
M: Medium
O: This is a very nice APA, clean and loaded with flavor."	4.25
3667	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Canned on 11/15/17 Opened on 12/6/17. Pours out a rather sexy orange hued gold with yellow highlights. Hazy...practically opaque with a white, bubbly foam matter that fizzles slow. Only the slightest scattering of foam andva minimal but present ring around tge edge of the glasd remains.. The nose is overwhelmed by dank hops....freshly crushed up whole cone hops, very earthy....wet forest on a mid july morning, herbal and spicy, hefty grains of the harvest, lightly sweet fruity notes, grandma's spice rack and a sweet, but light honey bite from the malt. Extraordinary..  1,690 characters	4.17
3668	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	"Thank you to my friends at Carmine Street Tap Room. I will always patronize an establishment that just does't sell beer, they love it.. There is something pleasant about balancing the undeniable greatness of bitterness. This is something that Trillium might do better than any other brewer. Bitter is the quintessential taste that complexity finds in mastery. Well done.. L: Thick like honey appearance
S: Tropical almost cherry served the middle of a grapefruit
T: Great fruity upfront, lingers to bitter rinds of melon, to a hint of dough, to the last drops of squeezed by hand creme
brûlée grapefruit finish
F: Lighter than I expected, almost session like. Clean, with dank undertones
O: Trillium is a masterful brewery, this mosaic dry hopped Fort Point pale ale is a highlight in my beer repertoire..  966 characters"	4.79
3669	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	16oz can purchased at the brewery dated 11/15/17. Hazy orange color and a fruity/hoppy nose. Flavors such as peach, mango, pineapple and a touch of grapefruit come through. A very tasty, smooth and enjoyable beer with very little bitterness on the finish. One of our favorite Trillium offerings.	4.66
3670	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	"Thank you CanConPhilly for this
16 oz can, dated 10/4/17, poured into a teku. A- A hazy golden orange with a two finger white head.. S- Really big and abrasive hops, tropical fruits, citrus zest, mango, grapefruits..  430 characters"	4.35
3671	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is lemon, herbal and some tropical notes. Well balanced. Flavors of citrus, a little pine and some melon and other tropical notes. Awesome pale ale.	4.43
3672	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Hazed dark orange with a finger-and-a-half of antique white head. Thick lacing. Mango, peach and a peppery-burnt-herbal thing in the nose. Similar tasting with a sweet tea impression on the back end. Medium bodied with heavy carbonation. Not my favorite in this series. 10/4/17 canned on date.	3.81
3673	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	"Went to Boston from Alabama with the express goal of getting the New England IPA experience (this is an APA I know). Almost every IPA lived up to their hype; however, I must say this one was riding Trillium's hype train. That said, everything else from Trillium nailed it.
Look: Moderately hazy darker orange with several smaller floaties. Only Trillium beer tried with any distinguishable sediment. Still a very pretty beer.
Smell: Citrus and earthy flowers. No grass or weed.
Taste: Citrus with significant bitterness. Not the juiciness found in their other beers.
Feel: Great light body for an APA. Almost heavy enough for a lighter IPA.
Overall: Definitely a great beer. No doubt there. I must say, after having their other beers, Trillium offers significantly better. One issue was that there was no date on the can, but it was bought directly from the brewery so assumed a couple weeks old maximum.
If anyone in the Southeast would like to know what this is like, go grab a can of Tropicalia from Creature Comforts. That's what came to mind while drinking it."	4.19
3674	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	A: Body is a very orange juice colored body. There wasn't much head or lacing in the beginning. Enough carbonation to keep a small head and a light lacing while drinking. Color is good but head/lacing is lacking.. S: Big fruity smells out of the can. Grapefruit seems to be the predominant smell. Also picking up some oranges and lemons. Very good aromas.. T: The tastes mimick the smell well. However, the oranges seem to overpower the grapefruit..  714 characters	4.47
3675	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	From an undated can (which I bought at the brewery 2 days ago, so assuming it's very fresh), pours a deep, hazy orange. Minimal head and lacing. Smell is incredibly complex, with a big blast of strawberries, followed by passionfruit, orange, tangerine, lemon and mango.. Taste is initially a huge hit of fresh pink grapefruit, like fresh-squeezed juice, before transitioning to a parade of other citrus and tropical fruits. Earthy notes, a hint of malt. Big, dry, wonderfully bitter finish. Feel is on the light side. Of all the beers I had from a recent trip to Trillium, this is my favorite. Wish I'd bought more.	4.71
3676	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	"Trillium - Mosaic dry-hopped Fort Point
Pale Ale - 6.6% abv
Canned 10/4/17 (11 days ago). L - sparse 1-finger head recedes quickly, leaving little lacing. Dark orange body.. S - orange, grapefruit. Wonderful nose..  426 characters"	4.27
3677	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Nice cloudy straw/amber color with white head. Aroma ma is a very pleasant citrus hoppy. Taste is a very smooth and pleasant combination of citrus and hops.	4.52
3678	Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point	Canned September 8, 2017. Poured into tulip. Pours orange with gold and amber highlights. Solid finger of head that sticks around, pun intended. The nose is amazing. Grassy, dank, mandarin orange. OMG, the taste is out of bounds! So crisp, floral, citrus abounds. Juicy orange leaves a bitter but juicy finish. Mouthfeel is great, leaves my mouth crisp with just a delicious linger. I need this everyday.	4.59
3679	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	I thought superior to base. Bold coffee taste dominates the bourbon barrelling character. Carbonation here beyond four years. Glad I went for this, glad I shared it.	4.14
3680	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2018 edition. Beautiful beer, with excellent head production for the style (more than a full finger), and very good retention as well; 10 minutes after the pour, there is still a thin layer of dark foam covering almost the entire top of the ebony body, and a fairly thick collar lining the edge of the glass.. The nose is promising: initially sweet, with chocolate, brown sugar, toffee, red grapes, cream, vanilla, coconut, and light bourbon mash, it quickly turns sharp and aggressive, with coffee, oak, and bourbon mash. This hits all the right notes, and implies that one should expect the full weight of the 13.6% ABV to fall upon the palate..  1,914 characters	4.41
3681	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2017 vintage.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light lacing and a thin blanket. Excellent lacing.. S - Big aromas of barrel notes galore. Tons of wood, almost dust level, great bourbon notes. The chocolate malt is subtle, almost licorice like an Abyss. The alcohol is nonexistent. There is light oat in the background as well..  933 characters	4.43
3682	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	"Big thanks to rudzud, 2017
Pours a very dark thick foamy rich 1+ finger head with great retention and sticky lacing, pitch black thick beer good legs. Nose big barrel, tons of toasted and vanilla oak barrel, with some bourbon, almost wood dust, big baking spice and licorice, spicy hop notes and roasty dark malt but not char level, some fudgey dark chocolate and chocolate marshmallow, little mocha coffee note,. Taste big barrel, big charred oak, dusty oak tannin and vanilla barrel, some bourbon whiskey, then fudgey dark chocolate, but not a ton, a strange vegetal peppery like baking spice on the middle I don't like as much, earthy coffee, some vanilla, light alcohol, later gets drier but spicy earthy roasty finish that gets a little difficult, with some alcohol too.  908 characters"	4.43
3683	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2018 release. Received from @woemad in a BIF box. Poured into a pub glass. It pours a dark walnut with cola hues at the bottom of the glass. The creamy, medium mocha-colored head faded slowly leaving a thin film of lacing inside the glass. It's highly aromatic with roasted malt, oatmeal, bourbon, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel, nuts, cocoa, tobacco, and earthy char. The taste opens with notes of both fresh and burnt coffee, oats, bakers chocolate, burnt nuts, leather, and char. As the glass breathes and warms, I'm noticing more caramel sweetness and just a hint of black cherry on the tip of the tongue. The bourbon is clearly evident but it doesn't overpower the other flavors, which are nicely balanced and nuanced. Despite the burnt notes there is surprisingly little bitterness at the finish. This Stout has a thick, creamy mouth feel with low/moderate carbonation. There is no escaping the 13.6% ABV, which is more than just warming. Sip this one slowly. Savor it because it is one of the best Oatmeal Stouts you'll encounter. Thanks, @woemad for the chance to drink this exquisite Stout.	4.59
3684	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	22 oz bottle poured into a snifter.. Near black with a thin tan lacing.. Nose: coffee-forward but still with a strong bourbon and oak presence..  311 characters	4.58
3685	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	Poured from fridge temp. Pours black and night, with very little dark head. The coffee is dominant on the nose. Chocolate, maple, vanilla, fudge, roasted malts. Taste is super intense. Lots of roasted malts, burnt wood, coffee grounds, vanilla, and chocolate. A nice bourbon backbone is throughout. The alcohol is definitely prominent - a slight bourbon aftertaste. Mouthfeel is actually a bit thin - not as creamy as expected. Overall, amazing.	4.51
3686	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tan head. Nice amount of sticky lacing.. S - Aroma is coffee, vanilla, coocnut and bourbon.. T - The taste coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, cocnut, toffee and bourbon..  389 characters	4.57
3687	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2018 Dark Star Coffee Edition from Freemont. Pitch black, thick, and oily. Dark dark dark brown around the edges and no light coming through. Half finger of mocha colored head dissipated quickly into smaller islands of lace that rest on top. The aroma is crazy layered and intense. The slightest hint of bourbon tickles my nostrils first, followed quickly by fudgy chocolate and a bitter roast underneath. Layers and waves of flavor hit some warmth and bourbon tingle the tongue to mix with dark chocolate, bitter coffee roast, and fudge. The mouthfeel is tricky, feeling chewy at times, but never thick. There’s no trace of the alcohol content in this. The barrels have lent the perfect amount of bourbon flavor without overpowering other elements. This is fantastic, and has achieved perma-want status!	4.79
3688	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2018 release, obtained in a trade from raticus. A superb BBA oatmeal stout with coffee, where all of the elements contribute just what you want and expect from a top-notch ale. Prominent barrel character, with oak, vanilla, and boozy heat, layered on an excellent base stout, rich and chocolatey with a full, smooth mouthfeel from the oats. The coffee accentuates the rich chocolate notes while adding an earthy bitterness and lightly nutty flavor. World-class, for sure.	4.34

3690	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	L - 1-finger dark mocha head takes several minutes to recede, leaving behind a pitch black body.. S - coffee first, then bourbon, chocolate, vanilla.. T - lots of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and barrel, all in perfect balance. Booze is present but restrained. Secondary flavors of oak, figs, anise, smoke, caramel, and tobacco. Low bitterness. Low sweetness. Moderate-low booziness..  482 characters	4.49
3691	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	"A fantastic BBA imperial coffee stout.
L - Dark as night, thick lacing around glass, black as Satan's bunghole
S - Where the nose hits the road; fantastic roast/coffee aromas, a little bourbon in the background
T - Fluorescence of the full taste; not hot, smooth, balanced. Definitely a bit coffee-sweet but so good.
F - Nearly perfect, great carbonation, not overly so. Not cloying.
O- Still one of the best coffee BBA RIS out there. Nicely done."	4.44
3692	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	On tap at Imperial on Alberta for their Fremont event.. Black with a dark brown head with good retention and lacing, this looks solid. Huge coffee notes with cream, chocolate, earth, medium roast. Mild roasted Brazil and macadamia nut. Mild coffee bitterness pairs well with buckwheat honey, earth and leather. Licorice and anise less pronounced than the regular BA DS. Excellent	4.39
3693	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2018 edition (blue wax)- adds 24-month aged (oatmeal) stout, and uses barrels that housed 7-12 year old bourbon; 13.6%ABV.. Poured from a bomber into my Bruery tulip.. Opaque bistre body, camel foam, resolving to a rouse-able surface slick and lasting collar. Fine sandy lacing, viscous but thin tears..  903 characters	4.39
3694	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	L:. Pours a pitch black with a small white tan head and no lacing on the glass.. S:. Strong notes of bourbon vanilla, chocolate and coffee, with notes of some cherry.. T:. Strong notes of bourbon and vanilla mix with a earthy and slightly bitter coffee, some chocolate and a note of cherry to make a truly luxurious stout. Alcohol is a bit noticeable..  458 characters	4.5
3695	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	"Bottle Date: 2017
Palate Contaminants: other beer. Very dark brown, very little light around the edges. Virtually no head, and even less lacing.. It's surprisingly buttery for a dark brew. Lots of clove, too. Both of those scents are really heavy. There are some other things on top of that, cinnamon, herbs, and molasses. It's a little strange to not get the usual suspects in something so dark and rich. It also volatilizes better than I expected..  953 characters"	4.38
3696	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	Well, the rule of thumb seems to be “Anything from Fremont with wax will be excellent.“. It’s always great to experience another stout in the rarified Abyss, Parabola and Wootstout world, and this one makes it there with ease. Beautiful blackest brown with only a tiny light leak at the meniscus. Subtle, rich and arresting aroma full of dark chocolate made a little milky by the oatmeal, french-press coffee with cream and tangy molasses. The taste is almost indescribably wonderful. An imperial coffee stout, yes, but so perfectly blended, so deeply complex, so rich and sweet yet dry in just the right places, it succeeds on every level. The feel can only be described as chewy, wonderfully, wonderfully chewy. It’s so beautifully blended it tastes like it’s had a couple of years in the bottle, but this is on tap at Beerworks in Medford (because they are so awesome). I do have one in the cellar...	4.56
3697	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	Can't believe I've never rated this one before now. 2018 bottle bought at the brewery like a week ago.. Body is rich and just this side of black... like blackstrap molasses. Large soft dark dark brown head swells up... I may not have left enough room in the glass. Oh well. Good lingering retention.. Nose has notes of fudgy dark chocolate and some bourbon spice and oak and of course black coffee..  1,175 characters	4.61
3698	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	"On tap at the brewery.
The aroma of this beer is one of the best. Bourbon, coffee, roastiness, and a hint of some cinnamon.
Taste follows the same, but it's so perfectly balanced between the competing flavors. Every flavor compliments the other, leaving no flaw for me.
I did expect it to be a bit more thick, but it still leaves a nice stickiness and the bourbon and coffee linger for a while."	4.71
3699	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2017 Vintage. A: Black, lingering medium brown head, lacing. S: Bourbon, fruity coffee, roasted malt, sweet chocolate, oak, mocha, brown sugar, bright fruity.  385 characters	4.48
3700	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	"Look: Poured into a Goose Island snifter. About a cm of head. Looks like espresso crema.
Smell: Lots of coffee! Not a lot of bourbon smell though.
Taste: Again coffee. Chocolate too. Reminds me a lot of KBS. Very smooth. Bourbon comes through over time.
Feel: I think a little thin for a big beer like this. Warming feel.
Overall: Very enjoyable beer."	4.43
3701	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	I receive an abundance of Fremont bottles in the last year, both from scavenging around Denver during GABF, and from a regular trade partner on BA. I've let many of them sit for a bit - and I'm now regretting that. Whatever made me sit on beer, I'll never know.. Dark Star Coffee is a gem of a beer. It features a rich chocolate-coffee nose and a creamy taste and mouth feel. There is a wealth of oak and bourbon to the taste, and I never thought for a moment that it was even sort of thin - the oatmeal stout characteristics of the beer are strong, resulting in that amazing sweet, creamy, rich, dense, complex taste and mouth feel. When chilly the beer even has a bit of a dark fruit note to it. This smooths right out in tremendous coffee - no bitterness or acidity of note whatsoever.. I regret sitting on this one - it's nothing short of fantastic. Dark Star is such an underrated, undervalued beer, and I really respect that Fremont has kept the quality high, given the quantity they are cranking out. The differences between variants, too, is noteworthy - they're all their own unique beast and definitely require review..  1,191 characters	4.68
3702	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	Pours black and despite pouring straight into the glass at a moderate pace, only a half finger of khaki fizz rose up at max. Head retention is poor. The second pour from the second half of the bottle headed a slightly larger and foamier head, but still not great retention. Aroma is dark, rich coffee right on the nose with rich roasted malts behind. Additional notes of toasted, caramel, and bread malts mingle with toffee, bourbon, and char to form a hearty, dark aroma. The 13% ABV peaks through the aroma letting the drinker know what they're about to consume. Flavor profile lands notes of roasted, toasted, and caramel notes right up front. Coffee, with a decadent chocolate note, and toffee, caramel, bourbon, and a bitter sting of char at the finish round out a deep, dark flavor profile. It hides its 13% ABV well. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a hearty, velvety, smooth texture that is warming and welcoming. Overall, a hearty stout with delightful notes of coffee throughout, exactly as the label would suggest. Great beer.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 22oz bottle.	4.64
3703	Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition	2015 vintage.. Look: Barely any head, very dark black body.. Smell : See below..  314 characters	4.97
3704	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Pungently funky with very light fruit notes. Vintage 2013. Pours quite surprisingly clear, pale pink-orange. Taste notes are quite light, carbonation is much like champagne.. Not exactly the revelation that I'd expected, but it's still quite good. Still trying to land myself a framboise - very excited about that beer.	4.5
3705	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	"2009 Sticker
Cork seemed to have dried out, when I opened the bottle some of the beer was on the inside of the cap, the cork was all wet.. Orange color with a white head that diminishes quite fast (I guess because of the open air cork?)
This is exactly what you want to smell from a Gueuze, huge array of complexity right up your nose, funk, slight acetic acid, lactic acid.
One of the deepest layered flavors I've ever had in a Gueuze, so much going in there but at the same time so mellow!
This bottle was a real treat!. We can see how Cantillon moves up their game with their Lou Pepe series!"	4.74
3706	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Clear orange pour. Nose full of citrus including lemons and oranges. Mouthfeel is not overpowering, with a decent citrus aftertaste. Overall very strong lambic beer.	4.5
3707	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	2010 vintage at Akkurat.. Pours a clear golden orange with thick, soapy foam.. Smell is very tart with notes of lemon, Seville oranges and grapefruit, covering a slight funkiness..  517 characters	4.73
3708	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm. I think this was a 2011 Akkurat blend. So perfectly balanced - not too sour and not too funky. The Lou Pepe are really a step above the standard Cantillon releases and that is really saying something.	4.5
3709	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Bottle of the 2013 split 3 ways at Hill Farmstead. Poured a lightly hazy reddish copper with maybe a finger of white head. This was incredibly delicious. Pleasantly funky, with some green apple, and a bit of acidity. Far too drinkable.	4.71
3710	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	2013 bottle from The Sovereign in DC.. Pours a reddish golden hue, minimal head. Nice funk on the nose. It's a delicately composed blend of funk, apple, and grape skins. It's well rounded, not too acidic. A beautiful beer worth of its name.	4.43
3711	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	"Poured from the 750 into teku glasses. 2010 vintage.
Pours a clear and sparking medium honey color with one finger of head.
Aromas are lots of yeast, bread, tart sourness in the nose.
Flavors are perfectly balanced tart sourness, salt and bread.
Mouthfeel was excellent. Finishes clean and dry.
Overall, a perfectly crafted gueuze."	4.44
3712	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	2009 sticker opened 1/29/2017. Loads of lime on the nose. Some hints of apple and oak. Green grapes in the flavor with some oakiness. Very wine like. The body is a tad thin bordering on watery.	4.25
3713	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Had this at Hill Farmstead last week. Amazing funk notes on this. Super perfect gueuze, The funk is awesome and sour. Looks great. Pours perfect. The taste is even better than the smell. This was the 2013 LPG.	5
3714	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Sparkling gold, off-white collar.. Holy funk! It's a challenging, confusing nose--I'm getting a patch of weeds, acetic olive brine, sherry vinegar, and cedar.. Taste is oak and tannin funk, white grape skin, grapefruit rind, brine, and black peppercorn. Pungent hoppiness seems to develop as it warms, and maybe a little kerosene..  361 characters	3.6
3715	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	"Not a gueuze guy, I rate this below Lou Pepe's average.
But if ever dryness could coexist with full flavor, it was in this 2013 vintage.
Never will I pay $40 again for a 1/2 bottle of beer... albeit a bomber I shared. But Lou Pepe is on the ""1001"" list and this bottle pushed me over the top of my 502 goal... so I guess the value has been rationalized."	4.16
3716	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Definitely don't get to drink Cantillon as often as I would like and when I do, its usually a treat. This was no exception; a solid gueuze that was enjoyable from start to finish.	4.57
3717	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	A 750ml bottle at Nüetnigenough. 2013 sticker, bottled on 27th April 2015. Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass.. Appearance: It poured a clear golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left some sparse lacing.. Aroma: Apple, floral, lemon, hay, grass, barnyard with a touch of light funk..  630 characters	4.5
3718	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Having had all Armand'4 last week, plus various other 3F goodies, I was curious how i would feel about a 2010 LPG this week.. Looked beautiful clear and gold, poured with moderate carb and a bit of head. Smelled like tart Cantillon, rather sweet and a bit fruity. Taste followed suit. Delicious tartness, a bit more tart than apple cider. Perhaps some wine barrel. I didn't find it as bitter as the classic bio gueuze. Fairly sweet and the mouthfeel was incredible - had nice body and quite sufficient balancing tannins. But...very little depth or funk. Found the drinkability high, but the complexity lacking. Perhaps, as others have stated, it needed more time. I plan to never open a LPG this young again (I believe it was the 2013 bottling of the 2010 vintage, opened July 2016).	4.37
3719	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Pours a hazy golden color. Aroma is tart and funky. Flavor is smooth gueuze tartness with a smooth acidic finish. Tastes like it as a little fruit in it. Feel is excellent, very velvety. Overall delicious.	4.43
3720	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Honestly was a little bit letdown with this one. To be fair, I had it at a share that included four other Cantillons. It's still a very solid Gueuze, but the lesson learned is that Cantillon simply makes much better beers than this one.	4.17
3721	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	2010 Sticker, poured into a taster. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation, funky, some oak and a bit of fruit. Sour but not puckering. Overall, a world class gueuze!	4.59
3722	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	2011 sticker. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Cantillon stemmed tulip glass. Acquired in a trade.. Pours a dark orange, pumpkin colored body with a big white head that reduces fairly quickly but leaves a nice layer or retention and some lacing.. Decanted and allowed to warm.. aromas of oak, funk, barnyard, hay, cedar, citrus, lactic.. aromas are potent and waft through the room, much more inviting than regular gueuze, definitely more wood character!.  863 characters	4.66
3723	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	"So I'm going to blend the scores here. Aged LPG and fresh LPG are two different animals. This is comparison of a 2010 sticker vs. a 2007 sticker. Had the 2010 on 12/21/15 and then 2007 on 1/1/16.. 2010 L: Looks like carbonated apple juice. Copper/amber hue with plenty of carb. 4.5.
2007 L: Looks like carbonated apple cider. Incredibly murky. 5.. 2010 S: A bit more mild than I expected. Close to regular gueuze but a bit more unique. Some apple, mild vinegar. That cleaner Cantillon funk, but a little dirtyness. 4.5
2007 S: Wow, that is mouthwatering. Granny Smith apples, plenty of dirty funk, but more lemony and lactic forward. 5..  1,560 characters"	4.58
3724	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	2013 vintage drank out of a chalice on 3/19/2016. Funky and tart, but not overly tart at all. Very refreshing and tons of crisp apple and grape flavors. Well balanced with some grassiness and nice oak as well.	4.43
3725	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	75cl bottle. Golden orange with a short-lasting white head. Smells like vinegar, macerated grapes, barnyard funk. Sour taste all the way, with interesting notes of mould, barnyard funk, apple vinegar and grape juice. Good stuff - probably the best gueuze I ever tried.	4.35
3726	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Pours an almost brown color, with a slight head. Smells a bit funky and citric. There is an intense early tart flavor to this, but it mellows out very nicely. Not overly tart at all. Lots of wood barrel in there also. Some slight carbonation rounds this beer out beautifully. So glad to have tried it.. 2011 750ml bottle	4.43
3727	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	"2011 Vintage
L: Apple juice color
S: SOUR
T: Seriously Sour!. Jaw locking type, absolutely loved it! Citrusy, pear, oak, TART
F: Medium bodied. Decent legs on the glass and nice carbination
O: This was fantastic...nuff said"	4.91
3728	Lou Pepe - Gueuze	Enjoyed out of a classic green glass 750 mL bottle with a 2011 sticker on the neck area. Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack tulip glass.. Appearance (4.5) - Fairly classic look, with a brassy golden, mostly translucent liquid with just a bit of haze on the first pour, and a bit more on the second (sorry, no lambic baskets lying around...). The body is capped by a two and a half fingers of creamy, slightly slick looking foam that is barely off-white. A few larger, sudsy-looking bubbles, but mostly composed of tight microbubbles. Retention is better than I expected, but still doesn't last long, , leaving just a few soapy wisps of lace on the glass after it recedes and some intermittent swaths of film on the surface of the liquid.. Smell (4.25) - Many of the elements of Cantillon's taste profile, but all more muted, or rather, mellowed than a gueuze containing younger lambic. Notes of oak and wet hay as well as an almost sugary sweetness that I don't recall from other Cantillon offerings. Some acidity that brings the impression of preserved lemon and there are also hints of ripe stone fruit as well. Lastly, an undercurrent of soft oak brings everything together. It's very integrated as an aroma--nothing individually jumps out, instead creating a cohesive aroma that really comes forward all at once..  2,611 characters	4.29
3729	Double Stack	A pitch black pour with virtually no last head. Just a thin ring of brown and off-white foam around the rim of the glass. The nose is intensely floral with a concentrated maple syrup aroma. I love that smell and I can't stop sniffing it. The drinking hits with big waves of lovely chocolate malt upfront. The mouth feel is very noticeable with just a thick, and full bodied feel that really coats the mouth and lingers well after each sip. Despite the nose the main flavor on the drinking is the coffee. Big and roasted coffee grinds that finish nicely bitter. I'm mostly getting the syrup note on the finish but its very pleasant and not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated it to be or what the nose suggests. Additional notes of caramel, brown sugar, smoke, charred oak, burnt toast, vanilla, and molasses. Despite it's feel and abv the brew is super drinkable and I'm starting to feel it.. Overall, WOW, just fucking wow. I love everything about this beer. Its big and brash but yet very refined with some many flavors going on. This is why the nbs bif is so worth it. A borderline 5 for me players. I could drink buckets of this.	4.79
3730	Double Stack	16oz can, dated 9/6/19 (I think, the first digit is smudged. Happens when you dat eon the shoulder of the can instead of the bottom) poured into 14oz teku. Poured the expected and typical solid black color, with 1/4 inch of light brown head that had low retention and lacing.. The aroma was all coffee. Full on burnt Folgers. No maple scent, and no beer aromas either.. Pretty similar on the tongue, with the maple showing up at the finish. There was also a noticeable alcohol hotness that lingered on the back of the palate..  1,038 characters	2.65
3731	Double Stack	Appearance: poured pitch black. Appeared slightly thin while pouring and with no presentable head.. Smell: heavy aromas of maple. Almost intoxicating with notes of pancakes. Coffee is kind of hard to pick up, likely due to overpowering maple. There is a slight mocha to the nose. Overall very sweet and robust.. Taste: sweet sticky maple. Just a touch more bitter than I expected. Coffee a little more noticeable with is slight char and roast, yet the maple still dominate. There's also bakers cocoa and notes of caramel throughout, adding a little more complexity..  835 characters	4.3
3732	Double Stack	Poured from a 16 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Dan! The taste of this follows the aroma with a nice mixture of maple and coffee. Thick. Very enjoyable.	4.5
3733	Double Stack	"16 oz can from Oregon via a friend. Pours a rich thick black with half finger of medium brown head. Aroma on opening can hits with maple syrup evoking a full pancake breakfast - in the glass the aroma remains strongly maple but with definite coffee notes and hints of chocolate.
Taste is sweet maple, vanilla, balanced by coffee/cafe au lait, minimal bitterness, milk chocolate.
Smooth sweet mouthfeel without ever being cloying - creamy with pleasant carbonation. Absolutely fantastic beer."	4.49
3734	Double Stack	Tasted from can. Pours dark brown with tan head. Lots of maple and coffee on aroma. Taste is sweet with a chewy and sticky mouthfeel. Flavors of maple syrup, molasses, coffee. Awesome breakfast style stout.	4.77
3735	Double Stack	Every Summer, I make this frustrating mistake of thinking that I’m actually going to spend the entirety of the three four high climate months crushing can after can of refreshing Pale Ales or IPAs. This misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers, and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time, while completely discounting such variables as (1) the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons; (2) my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer; and, (3) regardless of the season, I’m usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work, so I tend to reach for the higher ABV beers than the lower.. So until those three variables are somehow resolved internally, I usually find myself doing the exact opposite of what I think I would normally be doing in terms of drinking during the Summer months: instead of crushing session IPAs, wheat beers, and bretty saisons, I end up fruitlessly trying to solodome bombers of BA stouts and passing out with over half the beer still left in the glass; or drinking one 12oz bottle of a high ABV stout and trying to start another lower ABV IPA and then passing out with over three-fourth of the beer still left in the glass; or actually finishing two tall boys of an IPA, going to bed at like 12:30 AM and waking up tired and hungover.. My idiosyncratic drinking habits formed from my highly functional alcoholism aside, it seems like a single 16oz can of a moderately high ABV stout is usually right around my happy spot of where I want to be when I’m too tired to do anything productive yet not tired enough to go to sleep—lucky for me my favorite brewery has made the ingenious decision of canning their most famous beer in tall boy format; unlucky for me, it’s so rich it’s almost taken me 5 weeks to finish a four-pack by myself..  3,926 characters	4.43
3736	Double Stack	Pours really nice with a relatively thick tan head. Smells wonderful, tons of maple followed by roasty coffee. Taste is underwhelming compared to the smell. Neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose, and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up. Some bitterness comes through, but it's almost burnt-tasting, not sure if that's from the malts or the coffee. Feel is not great. Not really very thick for an 11% stout, and it's a little over-carbed too. Overall, a fairly good beer, but disappointing. I would probably like it a lot more if I hadn't tasted other far-superior coffee/maple stouts like ISLBS and Imperial Falling Colors.	3.96
3737	Double Stack	Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger thick foamy tan/light brown colored head that faded slowly and left very nice foamy lacing that did not slip down back into the glass.. Wow, the nose is like a fresh plate of pancakes with a whole bottle of syrup dumped on top of it. Aromas of fresh ground coffee, molasses, brown sugar, burnt coffee grinds, maple syrup, butter, cocoa powder, charred wood and sweet caramel or toffee notes. It teeters on too sweet, but is so rich and like an actual breakfast that it's wonderful to inhale. You can smell the brew in the glass from across the room.. The taste lived up to the hype. It was like dunking a syrup drenched pancake into a stout, then pouring the rest of the glass into the leftover syrup on the plate and tossing some coffee grinds in it. The roasty aspects and slight bitterness of the coffee dial down the sweetness to a reasonable level, but you'd better love maple syrup to drink this. The chocolate, roasted malts, burnt coffee, molasses and buttery notes from the aroma are also present in the flavor. This is craft beer at it's finest, as it's the total opposite of a macro brewed lager and yet made so well that it's delicious while hiding the 11% ABV masterfully. A nice chewy feel to the brew, it's so thick it has a syrup like resemblance. Outstanding overall.	4.85
3738	Double Stack	Pours with a dark moderately thick stream and forms an enticing dark khaki head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice ring of bubbles around the edge. The smell is very pungent and is dominated by maple. Taste follows the nose with tons of maple and hints of coffee, which comes out more as the beer warms. The body delivers about a medium mouthfeel, which might be this beer's weakest point. The carbonation is medium to high and the alcohol is well-hidden.	4.5
3739	Double Stack	Thanks to Jim S. for this 16 oz. can, a long-time want finally coming off the board.. The black pour looks sticky & swishing like a wine snob proves it to be true. The nose is spot on as advertised: coffee, roast, sweet syrup. Lovely.. Double Stack is more subtle than I expected (with no basis for my assumption). The maple syrup & roast blend seamlessly, neither more dominant than the other. Beyond the core there is a deep bitterness from the coffee, cocoa, touch of vanilla. No hint of booziness, but smooth, sticky, & very easy to drink. Not too sweet at all..  708 characters	3.97
3740	Double Stack	"I had on tap a couple of weeks back, but happened to be in the Portland area during a release. Naturally, I grapped some cans to go. It was good on tap, but couldn't help but think the feel and aroma were weak compared to the hype. Let's see how the can compares, shall we?
L: The beer pours our a uniform dark brown and near black. A 1/4 finger of a tan head formed from a standard and straight-centered pour. Moderate amounts of spotty lacing marks the glass as I consume this novelty beverage.
S: Holy fuck. As soon as I opened the beer, it was like being exposed in a room filled ankle-deep with maple syrup. The maple is unreal, and honestly fills the surrounding space of my humble abode. Even my wife noted the maple smell from a distance. Despite maple being the star of the show, roasted coffee and malts are also detectible on the nose.
T: As expected from the nose, the amount of maple makes you question if your existence was previously based on a maple tree-based beetle. Maple is present from the initial flavor to the very finish, and resides in an abundance in the aftertaste. Second to maple, molasses and coffee come next in a cascading order of events. The finish comprises an abundance of maple with underlying chocolate malts, molasses and nice black-coffee bitterness. Milk chocolate flavor also linger in the aftertaste.
F: Full in body, heavy in weight. The carbonation levels are at the perfection point- slight fizz on the tongue but the beer still approaches chewy status. It is creamy, full, thick and delicious. Alcohol is completely hidden, making this beer a sweetly lethal offering. Zero alcohol presence, which is testimonial for an 11% brew.
O: Can't say much other than this beer is phenomenal from the can. I am a huge fan of maple flavoring, and thankfully, the maple out weights the coffee by a long shot. On tap, I really enjoyed the beer; from the can, this beer is amazing. For 11 percent, this beer is the definition of a lethal weapon. Chocked full of sweet maple flavor and subtle milk chocolate with a malty finish. From the can, the beer tastes much more balanced and places a greater emphasis on maple syrup and other flavors than what I experienced on tap. I disagree with those that say it is unnatural tasting- its tastes natural, just with an abundance and overload of natural flavors than could be perceived as overwhelming. This beer is fucking great. I am very grateful I returned home with a couple cans. Cheers!"	4.55
3741	Double Stack	Poured into a tulip glass via can. color is motor oil black. smell is sweet maple syrup(almost overpowering) burnt coffee and traces of butter toffee.  481 characters	4.36
3742	Double Stack	On tap at the brewery.. Black with a thin brown head that leaves little lacing, this looks decent. The nose is loaded with maple and coffee with lots of chocolate and sugary sweetness. Sickeningly, syrupy sweetness. Mild vanilla, maybe a little dark caramel? The palate is insanely sweet with tons of maple, so over the top, with a syrupy coffee sweetness. This is like a Vietnamese coffee with more maple syrup than would be advisable, with a shot of vodka added. Boozy, sweet, astringently so on the finish, this is a chore.	3.01
3743	Double Stack	Pours a coffee black. Wow, what an aroma! Maple syrup and vanilla bean and some French press all meld together. Sweetly sippable and dangerously decadent. The coffee gives it a sharp edge that's balanced by the sweet side of things. Fantastic.	4.84
3744	Double Stack	Very maple. Very very maple. Look is very slippery for a stout - light brown trim on a dark pitch brown body. Maple dominates the nose with some light woodiness on the taste. Kind of has a bottler pitch quality to keep it on the family. I was warned about this beer and made some waffles to go with it. Wise choice.	4.39
3745	Double Stack	Appearance - Pours black with a big mocha colored head that settles to a thick cap great retention. Lots of stringy lacing around the glass.. Aroma - Wow huge amount of maple syrup, vanilla, coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. Smells like breakfast in a glass.. Taste - While the maple is more powerful in the nose the maple and coffee are equally strong in the taste. light vanilla and big roasted malts add great balance..  653 characters	4.71
3746	Double Stack	From a 32oz crowler, filled 10/25/18. Served in a tulip.. Pours impenetrably black with two fingers of fluffy brown head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thin webbery of lacing.. Powerfully intense nose of industrial strength grade b dark maple syrup..  996 characters	4.02
3747	Double Stack	this is a beautiful looking brew that is wildly aromatic. reminiscent of a sweet and roasty sunday morning breakfast in very way. creamy flavors throughout invoking buttery maple syrup drenched pancakes, roasty coffee is definitely there but it takes the back seat in a way, blending beautifully though. mouthfeel is perfect.	4.71
3748	Double Stack	Remember being a kid and having pancakes on the weekend and dousing them in syrup and getting everything sticky? It basically that and it’s wonderful. Not only is this an outstanding beer with amazing balance, it also is nostalgic in what I think of and for that it is unbelievable.	4.7
3749	Double Stack	Like eating maple pancakes for breakfast. Had this at Extreme last year and these guys make top notch stuff. Can’t wait to have more soon. Highly recommended.	4.5
3750	Double Stack	just full on maple as soon as the can is opened, taste and nose is all maple and the finish is toasty coffee. thin and not very creamy. imperial bean spirit is a better maple coffee stout in my opinion. but still absolutely awesome	4.41
3751	Double Stack	What a great stout. Looks are pretty standard on the imperial stout front: dark, thick mocha head and lots of lacing. Holy hell is there a ton of maple on the nose. As soon as I opened the can I thought I was smelling the inside of a breakfast restaurant. It’s like a stack of buttered packcakes/waffles with loads of maple syrup poured on top. I honestly can’t stop smelling this, it’s fantastic. Dark chocolate and strong coffee, as well. It reminds me of a Sunday morning. Creamy, too, like coffee and maple ice cream. Taste follows through with maple, especially as it gets warm. Also getting some espresso, Vanilla, bakers chocolate and a balanced sweetness. Feel is a tad thin for an 11% stout, but I can’t knock it too much. Overall, this thing is great. I’d love to trade for more of it. If you like maple and are seeking that adjunct in your beer, I’m not sure it gets any better than this. It’s one of the best beers I’ve had	4.77
3752	Double Stack	Poured from a 16 ounce can. Pours black with just about half a finger of brown head. Smell is huge on the maple syrup. It's strong enough I can smell it while it sits on the table. Very cool. Beer is chocolate on the front end but all syrup on the back. It's a full mouth feel with the syrup lingering for quite some time after. A nice sweet stout.	4.5
3753	Double Stack	"Wow factor. True imperial stout with tons of flavor with a chocolate finish.
On tap or in cans. This beer is...
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"	5
3754	Congress Street IPA	"A: dark orange orange like a pumpkin in November
A: light, hoppy citrus like the Easter bunny on vacation in Malibu
T: dry, pithy orange juice with a dollop of alcohol - Minute Maid has nothing on this
F: beautifully soft like running your hands through princess jasmines hair.. I really like this beer. It’s not the best of the best, but it’s damn solid for being a flagship."	4.23
3755	Congress Street IPA	Drank on 8/6/2019 - traveling hotel beer. Classy plastic glass at the Holiday Inn. Lots of mango, a bit pithy. Both juicy and resinous AND lightly bitter. Good one. I like this a lot. Beautiful hazy pour with tons of mouth feel.	4.5
3756	Congress Street IPA	World class, indeed! Beautiful foamy white head, hazy golden pour. Tropical fruit, citrus and pine flavors all vie for attention on your palate. The flavors that unfold do not attack you, they draw you in with understated subtlety.	4.56
3757	Congress Street IPA	"L- Hazy orange with frothy white head
S- Sweet papaya, Jamaican pineapple
T- Tropical bomb
F- Slick and refreshing. Perfect carbonation. The only bitterness is a deep mineral bitterness.. One of my favorite IPAs. The drinkability of a witbeer with the flavor of a DIPA. Amazing"	4.66
3758	Congress Street IPA	A - Hazy medium orange color with very sticky lacing.. S - Juicy peach and passionfruit slams the nose. The nose is pretty awesome overall.. T - Dank, juicy with a little but of spice. Peach, passionfruit with a little bit of citrus. The fruitiness carries from start to finish and ends on the sweeter side with very slight bitterness..  456 characters	4.31
3759	Congress Street IPA	Dark orange body, thick but slightly translucent, with a short white head and extravagant tiny bubble lacing. Nose is orange juice, slightly funky, with mango and other tropical notes in the background. Stronger tropical flavors, pineapple and passion fruit with the mango and citrus, and a close that is mild and clean. What a strong showing. This beer is so tightly dialed in, it is remarkable. Truly a great one.	4.8
3760	Congress Street IPA	Two finger head with retention on a beautifully light-hearted hazy hue. Nose and taste is a little tropical but mostly pineapple and pine with some great and subtle herbal qualities. Shared with a friend then immediately went to work for a Trillium trade! I've tried to do it again with no bites, I won't give up - this place lives up to the hype!	4.62
3761	Congress Street IPA	"L: pours thick and pale orange in color. Complete haze with 2 fingers if fluffy foam
S: oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, lemons...sweet but with the Rhine peels to balance it with slight twangy bitterness.
T: awesome balanced beer. Lots of citrus, but it has slight peel dank and bitterness near the end but not off putting and actually love the balance. Slight cracker malt in there too. Just awesome.
F: wow, an awesome drinker. Thick, velvet smooth, pillow soft. This is an absolute crusher"	4.79
3762	Congress Street IPA	Classic New England IPA looks with that yellow gold color and a massive 2 finger off white head that faded slowly and left really nice spotty lacing. Trillium IPA's keep the looks at the highest standard.. Smells super dank with fresh weed, orange peel, tangerine, guava, fresh pineapple, mango, wet citrus hops, floral notes, very light peppery spices, sweet malt, caramel and gummy bears. Not the most balanced brew, but super juicy smelling.. Tastes as good as it smells with everything listed in the description above plus grapefruit, lemon, Razzles candy, faint piney notes, orange juice and fresh cut grass. The same dank qualities from the nose come through with the flavor and add nice complexities.	4.44
3763	Congress Street IPA	Yeah, my can of this is old - really old (7/21/16) but this is a classic and I vowed to have it, along with everything else in my basement, before it burst or broke. Even though this was quite a bit of a malt bomb when I opened it, it wasn't bad and was still enjoyable to a large extent. Very little sediment was poured out as well, which made the experience that much better!. Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted peach with a ton of cloudiness to it. The head was sufficient and there was a bit of lacing here and there after the thin collar at the top, but it wasn't terribly thick or bright. Not a lot of pine in the nose but there was enough orange, tangerine, and cream in the nose to keep this soft. The clementine and rind came through in the taste along with a citrus sweetness that made this quite soft and easy to drink. A mild dank hop presence came through in the aftertaste and it was no secret that this felt like a malt bomb, given how much was in here. Loads of wheat gave this body as this was not terribly juicy nor dry from start to finish.... Just the right amount of alcohol was present too, as I felt a bit of warming but not enough to serve as a deterrent. This was a nice beer that had everything in proportion and was quite easy to quaff. I have no idea who Paul and Jess are but if they had this at their wedding, it would have been a great choice!	4.02
3764	Congress Street IPA	Canned 10/27/16; drank 11/5/16 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque light orange appearance.. Huge, fluffy white head; thick, frothy lace..  321 characters	3.84
3765	Congress Street IPA	16oz can. Pours two big fingers of fluffy white head into my willi becher glass. Dissipates a little bit, bit half a finger hangs around for quite a while. Body is redundant at this point – juice. Overall looks good so far.. It’s beginning to get very difficult to describe the differences between these NEIPA’s, they all smell so similar. Grapefruit, citrus dominate. Mild notes of dank/earthy hops in the background. Some sweetness muddling in here. Smells fine, I’m getting quite bored of drinking these though..  1,311 characters	3.86
3766	Congress Street IPA	Columbus Hop is biting right up front. Not a huge fan of this hop. It’s creamy. Opposite beer for me. Dulled when it warmed up. Showed it’s single hopped “ Sheare’ness “. Very good. Another good one from Trill. Need to try the Dub version of this!	4.29
3767	Congress Street IPA	I expected a little more for the price they are charging. Solid IPA, nothing more. The price gouging makes a ride to Charlton or VT for true world class beer a lot more appealing	3.77
3768	Congress Street IPA	Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.	4.5
3769	Congress Street IPA	Appearance: the body is a cross between baby yellow and tan. Totally opaque with haze with a 1-finger white head with good retention.. Aroma: super hoppy, but there this is an off aroma of ammonia and Windex.. Flavor: sticky lupulin that overpowers any other flavors that the hops might yield. There are no standout distinctive flavors to speak of – really just generically hoppy. There malt base is a very good start point; I’d try this beer repeatedly using different hop combinations..  748 characters	4.17
3770	Congress Street IPA	Very solid smooth IPA. Contains Australian galaxy hops with peach Clementine fruit and pine. Didn’t think it was amazing compared to other offerings like DDH fort point but solid.	4.28
3771	Congress Street IPA	Tastes and smells like biting into a citrus fruit on a freshly cut lawn beside a copse of pine trees. Great mouthfeel, very drinkable. Enough bitterness to balance out the juiciness nicely. A stalwart in Trillium’s awesome lineup.	4.53
3772	Congress Street IPA	Deep cloudy orange with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of orange cream soda, lemon skin. Tastes of orange cream soda, grass, lemon skin. Heavy body with light carbonation.	3.48
3773	Congress Street IPA	This should be top 10 ipa. Had in draft at the Greenway beer garden and in a 4 pack from the Congress st Brewery. Got a mixed case and no surprise , they are all incredible.	4.73
3774	Congress Street IPA	Can from brewery, package date 4/17/18. Pours a golden, glowing hue; head dissipates quickly, some lacing left behind. Smells of grapefruit.. Taste entry is a perfect balance of carbonation, citrus, and bitterness. Very drinkable — perhaps dangerously so, for a 7.2% ABV! Long finish on tip and middle of tongue. Really nicely done.. Brewery in Canton, MA is worth the trip. Lines are segmented into “pour line” and “can / bottle / growler line,” which keeps things moving. Fort Point location (Boston) sells beer, but not for tasting on premises. Their Boston “Beer Garden,” which I visited in fall ‘17, was a really nice outdoor venue (separate location from Fort Pt.)	4.6
3775	Congress Street IPA	Appearance - Pours murky cloudy deep orange color with nice fluffy white head. Lots of streaky lacing around the glass.. Aroma - Light orange, mango and tangerine mixed with some citrus peel, hops, pine.. Taste - Light citrus flavors mostly tangerine and pineapple not overly sweet. Nice hop bite flavor leans more to the bitter side than sweet..  499 characters	4.46
3776	Congress Street IPA	Poured a light gold and hazy with a small thumb of head. Not great retention and lacing is not really there.. Smell is fruity and yet grassy at the same time. I found some nice e tropicals in there, but also a bit of grassy hop as well.. Taste was similar to the nose. I really expected more from this one. It was tropical but there was an underlying vegetal taste that took away from it..  672 characters	3.9
3777	Congress Street IPA	Poured into a 13 oz Tired Hands Teku glass canned on 2/14/18. Pours a beautiful orange yellow with a massive 2 finger head that leaves plenty of thick lace behind.. Smell is guava, passion fruit, pineapple, mango, and grapefruit rind.. Taste is tropical front to back, a little hint of grapefruit and really juicy..  511 characters	4.5
3778	Congress Street IPA	Canned on 2/6/18 . 16 oz. Can. That was popped on 2/14/18. A murky..lo.k hazy....white gold that has an orange tint. I swear, Trillium IPA's look the same. NEipa. A finer than usual, white foam keeps a solid ring and light cover. Minimal lacing, despite one big quarter moon shaped ring.. Super-robust hoppy aromatics. Freshly picked spruce tips and hand crushed hops give off some deep aroma's : sweet mandarin orange, peppery pineapple, cantalope, strawberry tarts and maybe a tropical fruut juice blend. Dense, Heady nose..  1,129 characters	4.28
3779	Heavy Mettle	"One of the best NE IPAs I’ve had from trillium. A real bench mark for the style.
Nice thick orange body. Big white head.
Smell is pineapple and mango juice.
Flavor follows with a sweet yet dry finish. Allows you to keep coming back.
Juicy as hell. Thick but crushable. Doing all of the right things for the style."	4.63
3780	Heavy Mettle	"Poured on 10/15 from a can dated 10/11 into a Spiegelau IPA glass
L: Creamy yellow, opaque
S: cantaloupe, apricot, melon, grass
T: fruit at first, then hop burn
F: a little more carbonation and it would be have been perfect...that said, it did seem to dance on the tongue. A bit more would have enhanced the flavor.
O: In Trillium’s style, but slightly distinct from the others"	4.6
3781	Heavy Mettle	"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/15/17 with ""EW-WAM-AM-AH"" written below that. I don't know what that means or if that is a heavy metal reference but I can honesty say that this was a typical Trillium beer that had all of their attributes present in it, including an easy sense of enjoyment to it throughout my session!. Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted honey with enough off to offset the the cloudy, dull liquid even though that settled relatively quickly. Only a few spots of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this as the residue on the side of my pint glass was quite disappointing. Tons of mango, citrus rind, booze, and yeast filled the nose although they were quite muted from the first whiff onward. Dank, pithy, and strong, tons of melon, cantaloupe, and kiwi came through as this warmed up but it was never easygoing enough for me to fully embrace. This had a creaminess and slickness to it that saved it from being a disappointment but it needed more sugar and tangerine from feeling too heavy, as the carbonation was nearly nowhere to be found.... No doubt that this had enough alcohol to it and it seemed to complement the subtle hop burn quite well. That wasn't what I was looking for as this beer put the ""heavy"" into heavy mettle. Tons of Galaxy hops ensured that this would be a dank hop bomb but in the end, this needed it's rough edges rounded out a bit. Worth a go for those who love Trillium but this didn't match up with their better, and more popular offerings..."	4
3782	Heavy Mettle	"A: Hazy gold/yellow with rich white head and sticky lacing.
N: Loads of citrus, hops, tropical tones, and pine.
T: Follows the nose a lot, tropical forward with solid hops hit, some bite but silky at the same time.
M: Medium
O: Loved it, drank so clean and easy, hard to believe it' s almost 10% ABV."	4.74
3783	Heavy Mettle	"Look - classic nehazy and golden color
Smell - juicy fruity. Grapefruit tangerine
Taste - slight bite fruity tangy. Similar to the scent but more extreme
Feel - medium full body with a light carbonation
Overall - great beer but more bite then needed"	4.46
3784	Heavy Mettle	10/15/18 batch, updated rating and review... .my Prior rating was 4.7, this was the first trillium beer I ever had and it opened my eyes to the unique flavors that hops can impart on a beer.. what a disappointment ... a formerly magical and uniquely flavorful beer is now a heavy, overly sweet and muddled mess. Look is dark.. pour yields very little head, a small ring remains.  1,269 characters	3.08
3785	Heavy Mettle	Bright orange, sticky head. Smells like sweet orange, mango, pineapple, and dank hops. Tastes are the same as the scent with a great balance of sweetness from the fruit flavors and the bitterness from the hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel and hidden alcohol. Great beer.	4.66
3786	Heavy Mettle	Very cloudy straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and other citrus without any hoppyness. Taste is a Devine grapefruit that is very smooth and no hops at all.	4.67
3787	Heavy Mettle	[Original rating 2017-12-26] Draft at Armsby Abbey Worcester MA. Easily one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. I want to just sit and smell it. Pours cloudy dark gold with a medium white head. Aroma of citrus, peach, straw. Taste is tropical fruit, peach, a little bitter in the finish. Great balance. The alcohol is very well hidden, does not seem like 9.3%.	4.46
3788	Heavy Mettle	Another excellent beer from Trillium, this one pours a thick, hazy yellow and smells softly of stone fruits. To the tongue, the peach and nectarine are most prevalent, but there is a little more of a citrusy taste underlying it. The milky texture and grainy undertones prevent this from being too fruity.	4.44
3789	Heavy Mettle	Wife Picked-up a four-pack at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty bucks. Guessing she didn't notice the 9+ ABV. Pretty smooth, considering the ABV, a bit dank, nice brew.	4.25
3790	Heavy Mettle	From a 16oz can, dated 10/15/18. Served in a Trillium-branded tulip. #properglassware. Pours a massively murky glass of OJ with a scant finger of soft, creamy head. Retention is no better than so-so, leaving a pretty, creamy collar and a thin curtain of lacing.. Robust nose of pineapple, weed and sexy, sweaty girl..  1,263 characters	4.19
3791	Heavy Mettle	"Canned 11/21/17.
Moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a cloudy, golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of dank everything. Taste of Columbus hop dankness first, followed by the citrus of Galaxy and Amarillo hops, with a bit of flowery spice from the Amarillo. Normal soft feel for a cloud bomb such as this. Finishes with a moisture-sucking dryness. Overall, I think I'd like this even less if it was fresh and more palate-whacking. Cheers!"	4.23
3792	Heavy Mettle	Just an enormously hopped beer that blows beyond what my finicky palate can handle these days. Carry on and pick up the info you seek from a more hop-headed review.. About as archetypical, in look and taste and feel, for a 9%+ NE Style DIPA that without the darling new hops in the mix (Mosaic, Citra, Galaxy, etc.). Just an enormous specimen that will hop-punch your pie hole out the back of your head.	4.14
3793	Heavy Mettle	"Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy orange color with creamy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour is complete.
The aroma is the expected citrusy notes of orange and some grapefruit, with also some fresh cut grass and a bit of pine sap and resin. I get just a little bit of biscuity malt buried in the beer and the high ABV is pretty well hidden on the nose.
The first sip reveals a silky texture with very fine and prickly carbonation. The beer dries out intensely on the swallow, but before that I experience a wide range of hop characteristics. I get orange peel and grapefruit rind with some pine sap and again the fresh grass, (especially on the burps). There is a bit of sweetness, but not from malt, more the citrusy fruit notes. I get a bit of peppery alcohol bite on the swallow along with some warming in my belly, but this beer could be consumed quickly, which makes it a little dangerous at 9.3%.
Quite a nice Double NEIPA, Im glad I got to try this one and would do it again if trying to fulfill my hop needs some night."	4.28
3794	Heavy Mettle	Golden and hazy with no visible carbonation. Topped with a finger of yellowish head.. Smells of grapefruit, grass, orange juice, a hint of evergreen, heated hop resin and a hint of paint thinner.. Amazing taste, certainly get the alcohol on the end but very orange juice, hoppy, resinous, and turpentine forward, with hints of green leaf. Its slightly sweet with a grapefruit pith bitterness..  589 characters	4.1
3795	Heavy Mettle	If I wanted to impress Amanda Kerr, if she said, “Raul, bring me the best haze you got...” I would not hesitate, and I’d go straight for Heavy Mettle. Hella robust tropical fruits on the nose and tongue; but all greeted by that oh-so-familiar dry, pithy aftertaste. Again, the last part is not for Raul, but he defends your right to love it. Cheers.. *huge edit - damn, as this beer warms it grows on you. The flavor was always there, but the aftertaste is so lush and balanced. Hell yes, Trillium	4.41
3796	Heavy Mettle	"Poured to a teku glass.. A: The body is yellow, bright, opaque and hazy with a matte finish. The head is white but shows medium to weak retention and no lacing.
S: The aroma is very rich on grapefruit, pineapple, resinous profiles and citric ends. Alcohol is just a bit too noticeable.
T: Taste starts off with a citric and grapefruits flavour that evolves to a pineapple-y fusion that finished off the presentation with a big resinous profile. In the back, a big hoppy, Mosaic and Galaxy? like.
M: Body is medium to high. Carbonation is good. Alcohol is noticeable but not huge. Bitterness is also high.
O: Overall, very aromatic DIPA. Trillium-good DIPA."	4.26
3797	Heavy Mettle	Great color, lots of carbonation, some floaters (which was unusual given the freshness of the can), but TONS of flavor that really punches you right in the mouth. AWESOME!!	4.6
3798	Heavy Mettle	"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.. 16 oz. Can
Canned On: 11/21/17. Poured into a Trillium glass a very nice cloudy orangy/yellow color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger plus white head, which also leaves some pretty nice creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a really nice citrus complex (orange, grapefruit, nectarine, tangerine, peach, mango), very nice diesel like. The taste is very nice, hoppy (really picking up on the Galaxy), malty, really nice citrus complex (orange, grapefruit, tangerine, peach, nectarine, mango), really nice diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, another very tasty brew from Trillium. Addictive! Orange Julius! Glad I got a chance to try this. Thanks Bill!"	4.84
3799	Heavy Mettle	Hazy orange pour with slight head and nice lacing .... smells of passion fruit, pineapple, mango and light orange ... tastes of all the same with little boozy bite at the end.... at 9.3 you’d never know based on taste.... dangerously tasty beer	4.24
3800	Heavy Mettle	Pours a dark orange color. Completely opaque and quite hazy. Thin white head dissipates leaving a thin ring of white foam along the outside of the beer. No lacing.. Aroma has notes of green hops, melon, orange, pineapple with a hint of a soapy aroma.. Taste follows the nose with some green hops, pineapple, grapefruit and lots of grapefruit rind. Touch of honey sweetness. Bit of alcohol flavor on the back end. Medium bitterness lingers to the finish..  804 characters	4
3801	Heavy Mettle	This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color reminiscent of honey. There is a two finger, creamy white head with average retention for the style. It leaves some spots and patches of lacing on the glass.. Smell is pineapple, melon, mango, and orange hop flavors with a nice bit of honey sweetness to round it out.. Taste is the same, but there is a pithy and piney bitterness that goes along with the fruit and malt sweetness. Also a touch of alcohol heat on the finish..  757 characters	4.55
3802	Heavy Mettle	Canned 11/21. Luscious orange-yellow color with a creamy 2 finger head.. Aromas. Wow. Yes, plenty of them. Oh, you want a description? Freshly sliced fruit platter - it's all here. Mangoes, kiwi, oranges, melon, tangerines, honeydew, strawberries, passion fruit. Slight dough-y smell, too. It's just incredible.. The juicy fruits in the nose are more muted on the tongue than I was expecting. IBU's are through the roof here. Lots of orange-tangerine-pith, with heavy rindy bitterness and hints of cantaloupe. Bitter rye cracker, pine sap, some light alcohol flavors. Lots of resin and rindy bitterness remaining. I wish it was more fruity and easy-drinking, hence the 4 vs the 5 on the nose..  1,000 characters	4.36
3803	Heavy Mettle	Golden opaque with cloudy fluffy head. Persist for a while leaving minimal lacing.. Apricot, peaches and honey.. Warming booziness and very soft sticky finish	4.4
3804	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Citrus and pine aroma. Full, fat mouthfeel. Flavor of citrus up front and pine at the finish with a slight bitterness and tang. No chalkiness or hop burn. One of the best hazy IPAs I have had the pleasure to drink.	4.43
3805	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"L: Pours a hazy yellow light orange color. An aggressive pour results in a big foamy white head that fades quickly but leaves some very nice lacing around the glass.
S: Grass and pine that leads to orange, peach, and grapefruit.
T: The taste follows the smell, grapefuit, orange, peach with low bitterness. No hop burn or chalky taste.
F: Creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation and body."	4.5
3806	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	L - pours a pinkish, orange..ish peach mango juice haze. Glows healthily with a jiggly jell-o head.. S - bright and peachy with a hint of cantaloupe. Creamsicle smoothness with a layer of oniony, resinous hops to round off any sharp corners.. T - peach jam and orange marmalade. I remember the OG being zestier! The saturated hops suffocate any particularly daring flavors and amp up the candied creaminess. Ripe mango and ruby red grapefruit doused with a healthy layer of sugar. Vague honeydew melon until the rind sets in. Oniony and bitter... there's my zest! Just waited til the finish. Well-crafted bitterness begs another sip..  974 characters	4.67
3807	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Ddh mylar @ OH. Pours a saturated hazed yellow color with a smaller, stable head.. Smells of cactus juice, kiwi, water melon and exotic fruit sorbet. Has a nice lime quality atop, as well as some unripe strawberries and bright grapefruit, creating a very well rounded, complex nose..  933 characters	4.45
3808	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	I only rarely get my hands on Other Half beer these days, though it seems to a little more easily had these days - but the hype around this particular beer has always made it a wish list item. Plus, I love double dry-hopped beers.. DDH Mylar Bags distinguishes itself as a bit of a different IPA in the tropical fruit notes - most particularly, to my palate, the pineapple notes in the nose and taste. It's also quite dry, though very sweet, with a fairly clean finish. It's very hazy and thick, not exactly a casual drinking beer though very drinkable. I just can't imagine drinking more than one or two at a sitting - it's very filling and substantial.. Overall, it's quite a good beer - very memorable.	4.66
3809	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Canned 2.13.19 opened 2.17.19 poured into a chalice. Hazy orange liquid , one finger off white , quickly settles to a layer. Aroma of citrus, orange, grapefruit rind, whiff of pine, whiff of dank.  276 characters	4.46
3810	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Appearance: Pours cloudy and honey/orange colored with a two finger head; good retention and splashy lacing. Smell: Dank, pithy and citrusy with a tropical fruit edge; lime tones emerge. Taste: Dank, pithy tones with lime, grapefruit and tangerine; moderately bitter through the middle and into the finish, with a hint of sweetness in the aftertaste.  496 characters	4.25
3811	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Pours a cloudy orange. Lots of hops going on - El dorado, Citra, Galaxy, Mosaic and Armarillo. Good combination. Limited bitterness in aftertaste. Good head and mild aftertaste.	4.5
3812	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Pours an opaque orange that turns into a murky burnt-orange when the final ounces are poured from the can into the glass. Head formation is pretty good, netting a finger and a half of white foam. Head has good retention. Aroma is orange peel, tangerine, papaya, lemongrass, and melon-dew. There is a light biscuit malt note, but faint compared with the onslaught of hops. Flavor profile is dripping with hops, without being very soupy or confused. Hops hit notes of orange peel, tangerine, mango, papaya, and lemon zest. Biscuit and bread malts form a firm foundation and actually show throw the dense curtain of hops, making for a well balanced DIPA. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a lightly grainy texture. Overall, a great double-dry hopped NE IPA, showing good balance despite having an absolute onslaught of hop notes from the get-go. Mouth feel is not chalky, which makes it much better than other well-known NE IPA producers' double-dry hopped offerings.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.	4.68
3813	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	01/2017 - One of the better Other Half IPAs I've had to date; combines the big ethanol quality of that I've come to expect from OH with the fruity, zesty, yet still hoppy qualities reminiscent of NEIPAs.	4.43
3814	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn.
That OH look; lemon verbena, grapefruit rind, kronik, and mint; cream cracker, creamsicle, ganga, limeade, peach, watermelon… I could go on; dead creamy.. Mosaic, Citra, Galaxy, El Dorado, Amarillo. 4 4.5 4.5 4.25 4.75.  480 characters"	4.5
3815	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	No canned on date! Bummer, but It’s from the 8/11 release.. The pour is an awesome hazy deep orange, with a nice finger and half of frothy white head that leaves amoebas of laces around the rim of the glass.. On the nose, subtle hints of grassy, piney hops keep bursts of tropical fruits, sweet candy, and tangerine at the perfect level. Great balance of aromas..  645 characters	4.71
3816	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Probably the best all round hops I’ve had. So so drinkable with the signature other half mouth feel. Tropical fruit on the nose and mouth, can’t say enough how soft this is. A masterpiece	4.82
3817	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"DDH Mylar Bags - Other Half
IIPA - 8.5% abv
Canned 4/25/18 (11 days ago). L - 2-finger high density offwhite head atop a vibrant, orange juice body. No light shall pass through this one.. S - orange, grapefruit, mango, cotton candy, a little pine..  598 characters"	4.44
3818	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"Look: super hazy, yellowish orange in color with a thick creamy 1 inch head
Smell: grapefruit, some grass and a lot of peach
Taste: front is super juicy, peach and grapefruit bomb, middle still is juicy but starts to become more bitter and floral, finish is bitter lemon grass.
Feel: medium velvet mouth feel, finish is rather carbonated and bitter for a hazy ipa."	4.48
3819	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) bag into a conical pint glass; production date 11/18/18.
A: Pours an opaque, golden (slightly brown of that) color with a one inch, foamy white head, strong retention and rings of lacing.
S: Fruity. Aromas peach, tangerine, and maybe some pineapple mix with a graininess.
T: Dry. Tastes more on the grapefruit side of citrus with the pitted fruit secondary. Strong, lightly roasted maltiness forms a strong backbone with solid bitterness as a counterpoise.
M: Closer to full bodied than medium with solid carbonation. Drinks remarkably crisply for the style.
O: Really a treat. NE style IPA from NY -- ?NYIPA. Another home run from Other Half."	4.61
3820	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Tall can, date is miss stamped on the bottom....from the brewery today.. Typical OH NEIPA pour...leaves nice fine scattered lacing.. Juicy, juicy ripe pineapple nose..  336 characters	4.58
3821	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	12 Jul 17 backlog from untappd. mylar bags was my number one from other half until this baby came along. this is the beer i think of when frank gallagher is brewing the milk of the gods in the basement on shameless. great beer.	5
3822	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Thick and creamy citrus. Almost like an orange sherbet. Hazy and frothy appearance. Strong zesty notes in the aroma. Drinks so smooth and flavorful. Dreamsicle in a glass without the sweetness!	4.32
3823	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	This one pours a hazy murky yellow-ish color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.. The aroma just blasts your nose out of the glass- tons of tropical fruits, soft and sweet, with a hint of black tea and pine.. This is absolutely great- it's probably my favorite Other Half beer at this point. It's a maelstrom of tropical and citrusy hops, with a small amount of tea-like and piney bitterness..  539 characters	4.76
3824	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"Poured from a can into.12oz snifter, dated 3/21/2018
Electric yellow in color
Smell is all pineapple and guava
Taste is a generous portion of pineapple and melon..very sweet almost candy like..delicious IPA..regular mylar bags is top notch, this double dry hopped version just amps the ante quite a bit"	4.56
3825	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	drinking this at over a month old as I received in a trade past optimal freshness. pours out a hazed golden color with a dense and creamy bright white head that leaves excellent lacing. nose is somewhat subdued, some dank and citric notes playing with a sweetish malt quality. on palate it pops a little more, and brings ripe mango, soft peach, grapefruit, orange, herbaceous grassy note, sweet bready malts, danky earth, and a mellow hit of slightly resinous pine on the finish. super well balanced and rounded, perhaps due in part to the age. would love to try this fresh but hot dayummm this one held up nicely, cheers!	4.46
3826	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	This beer pours a completely opaque, super murky, golden orange color with a two finger, creamy, frothy white head. Retention is above average and there are tons of chunky rings and patches of lacing left all over the glass.. Smell is very bright, dank and fruity. Mango, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and lemon pith are all present in spades as well as a bit of dank earthiness and pine.. Taste is the same. Very juicy up front with a bit of pith and pine providing a moderately bitter finish..  858 characters	4.5
3827	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	"Drank on tap at Other Half Brewing Co., Brooklyn, NY
Served in a tulip. Cloudy yellow ochre appearance. The nearly opaque liquid was topped by a small, frothy white cap that quickly dissolved. Minimal spotty lacing stuck along the glass.. The aroma was amazingly hoppy and bright. Super dank and juicy. Cannabis definitely came to mind. Intense citrus notes too. Loads of juicy orange and tangerine. Some crisp wheatiness as well. Perhaps a bit simplistic overall but flawless nevertheless..  1,336 characters"	4.79
3828	Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags	Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is s very pleasant citrus. Taste is also a very smooth pleasant citrus with a touch of hops.	4.52
3829	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Unknown vintage; drank 10/22/15 on draft @ Fischman's.. Black/brown appearance.. Minimal dark tan head; nice lace..  323 characters	4.25
3830	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Had on tap. Poured charcoal black with a finger of brown foam. Smell captures the roast of the coffee beautifully, with dark chocolate, licorice, leather, and char supporting. Taste is not as coffee forward but still very much present, lots of malt with supporting flavors from the nose plus some vanilla and tobacco. Feel is chewy, creamy, heavy, and roasted. An amazing coffee stout	4.58
3831	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Small glass from draught @ Zeezicht Breda. I had this before once from draught, which I remember to be superb. This time: Pours a pitch black colour and a beige/light brown head with short retention. Aroma's: sweet, chocolate, boozy. Retronasal: sweetish, cocos, fruity/boozy alcohol. Flavour is moderate sweet, boozy alcohol. Alcohol is rather sharp. Almost full bodied. a bit too alcoholic. Next time will be better again (I hope).	3.67
3832	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!	4.37
3833	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Tasted on tap at Ansari's, Eagan, MN. The coffee is front and center in this one. Pretty dry. I'm glad I got to try this on tap so I don't need to chase a bottle.	3.3
3834	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Dark brown with a slight transparency, and almost no beige foam.. Smells of coke, cocoa, and toasted malts. A little coffee in there too.. Tastes of fruitiness, cocoa and chocolate. A hint of black liquorice as well..  384 characters	4.03
3835	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Pouring this from a 16 oz. can into a tulip glass, this beer pours out absolutely beautiful. It’s pitch black and forms a two finger, creamy, thick, dark mocha colored crown. The crown holds well and leaves lacing. It would be hard for this to look much better.. The nose brings roasty, dark malts more so than roasty coffee. However, there is a coffee presence. It also brings a bitterness to it that resembles bitter bakers chocolate; dark chocolate. A smooth cream note wants to show, but hardly does. Almost an earthy, peat like note?. The taste brings in a cream presence along with those roasty, slightly burnt malts. Bitter, dark chocolate still showing. A black pepper like spice shows up at the end, along with a little bit of an earthy wood/smoke presence..  1,135 characters	4.05
3836	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Poured 32oz crowler into snifter. Obsidian in color with huge 3 finger foamy mocha head. Slowly fades into a nice cap and thick collar and webbed lacing on my glass. Roasted malts, coffee, cocoa and rich dark chocolate blend with hints of pepper and earthiness. Flavor is bold with the Speedyway stout base, loaded with bitter chocolate, cold pressed coffee, hints of roasted malt and cocoa. Some earthiness from the hops along with hints of pepper and cream. Thick body, chewy and sticky. Rich, smooth and creamy. Really nice coffee addition to SS.	4.48
3837	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	L - huge, thick hazelnut head atop a pitch black body.. S - milk chocolate, vanilla, vietnamese latte.. T - tons and tons of fragrant coffee poured over bittersweet chocolate. Vanilla, roast, molasses, a touch of earthy hops. Moderate-low bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness..  437 characters	4.37
3838	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Pours black with two fingers of caramel colored foam. Head retention is great. Aroma is big chocolate, coffee, toffee and roasted and toasted malts and barley. It's huge. Flavor profile is coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee and roasted and toasted malts with some bitter barley. It tastes big. Mouth feel is velvety and thick. Overall, sublime coffee stout. Big coffee combined with a big stout for a win-win.. Draft. Reviewed on phone. 10oz pour into a stemmed large wine glass.	4.52
3839	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	L:. Pours a pitch black with a very small brown tan head and a some dots of lacing around the glass.. S:. Creamy rich chocolate, a bit of vanilla, some coffee reminiscent of mocha or coffee ice cream. Smells very rich and decadent.. T:. Creamy rich chocolate, some vanilla, mixes with a mocha like coffee and a coffee ice cream, not overly sweet but very nice..  461 characters	4.35
3840	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Received this can as an extra back in the summer. Could have sworn I'd reviewed regular ol Vietnamese Coffee Speedway before, but upon further review I found out it was the incredibly rare draft only 'Brewers Blend' rendition I had back in 2012 and incorrectly reviewed under this regular version. Good memories for that beer thanks to JLindros! Canned on 4/25/18. Review #3500.. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice black hue with a good almost two finger dense mocha head that faded slowly to leave a thin, creamy blanket. Not really any lacing though the legs are nice enough.. S - Aromas of nice typical speedway stout. creamy chocolate, malts, almost caramel. The coffee is not super aggressive but a nice creamy espresso. Quite pleasant and creamy. Very Vietnamese like combined with the chocolate and creamy notes it has an almost coffee ice cream like aroma. Decent lighter roast too..  1,634 characters	4.45
3841	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	"This beer pours like motor oil. Thick, black. Tan head, 1 1/2 finger. Retention is good, and nice lacing on the glass.
The nose has got a nice mellow coffee aroma. Smooth smelling.
Taste/feel - Rich, and thick. Got a nice coffee flavor, that comes on the front, with a warm boozy finish, but not harsh boozy taste. The body is thick. Has a creamy feel right away when I sip it.
Solid Stout overall. Delicious and fun to drink."	4.44
3842	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Amazing beer. Pours black with a nice beige cap, and awesome lacing left on the glass, especially for a big stout. Nose is dominated by rich roasted malts and coffee. Taste follows the nose, but imho the dark chocolate flavors dominate the coffee. Body is fairly typical for the style, as is the carbonation. The abv is extremely well hidden for a 12% stout. This is an amazing beer, and my only wish is that I could have it more often.	4.65
3843	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	"2018 vintage, 16 oz can, canned in April of the same year.. pours an opaque jet black. head is frothy and is a rich cappuccino hue. good retention and lacing. looks the part. aroma is a heck of a lot of coffee but even more chocolate. dark and sweet chocolate aromas all at once. vanilla notes as well. flavor is rich, thick, and fairly cloying. boozy, but not over the top. roasted beans, mild acrid bitterness.
overall a really good coffee stout. not sure if the Vietnamese coffee is bringing that much of a difference, but it is certainly commanding a higher price tag. happy i tried it, but not willing to pay for it again."	4.11
3844	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Stout brewed with four different coffee styles. Extremely well balanced with coffee finish and extensive aftertaste. Color is pure and taste is fantastic. Had on tap at Other Half as well. Solid coffee taste and good stout.	4.5
3845	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Able to score a goblet on tap from a local Italian eatery...very surprised to find it around here. Slowly, finally, these really good breweries are starting distro in this area. Color is a dark brown. No obvious carbonation but a tiny sliver of head. To touch, the temp was cool to room temp. Aroma was very coffee forward, balanced like a breakfast blend smell. First sips were hot from the alcohol, followed by a smooth coffee presence from front to back of tongue. Mouthfeel was full and left a nice coffee, milk chocolate aftertaste. If I could find this bottled, definitely worth cellaring a few to see how the burn subsides and the flavors develop. It seemed a little one-dimensional fresh, so I imagine aging is a must for this one. The straight Speedway stout seemed to have more complexity fresh. Definitely worth a try.	4.03
3846	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Had it on draft. Very dark brown color with a creamy brown head and great lacing. Rich chocolate cake smell and taste. Dark coffee and cappuccino flavors become more pronounced as it warms. Hint of strawberry. Very rich and silky smooth feel. Great beer!	4.44
3847	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Luscious. The aroma and flavor are top notch for a coffee stout, delivering exactly what I’d hoped for.. On tap at Haymaker, NYC, I let it sit and warm as the black brew settled down and the brown head eased down to a nice little layer while leaving good spotty lacing.. The nose is a robust combo of coffee beans, spent coffee grinds, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, molasses, light soy sauce, roasted malts, charred wood and a malty sweetness from the toasted grains and perfectly blended coffee..  936 characters	4.86
3848	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Draft @ 7 Monks in Traverse City. A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tan head. Tons of soapy lacing.. S - Aroma is coffee and roasted malts..  406 characters	4.46
3849	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	"Draft in Pittsburgh
Looks pitch black with khaki thin head.
Smells sweet and rich and roasted.
Tastes like rich coffee with condensed milk and sugar in roasted malt base.
Fantastic, not over done.
Creamy mouthfeel.
Slow sipped."	4.89
3850	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Dark, thick beer with a brown sticky head that leaves nice bands of lacing behind. The coffee aroma punches you on the nose and it's complimented with a sweet and roasty malt smell. Sweet and coffee up front with a fantastic coffee char bitterness at the end. As usual the Speedway Stout is a delicious beer and the Vietnamese coffee adds a lot to it.	4.5
3851	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	"Pours pitch black, with a tan head and some minimal residual lace.
The nose on this is all coffee, roasty, charred espresso beans. It hits hard and settles nicely, complimenting a sweet, milky finish.. The body on this is awesome. Medium viscosity, with a carbonation that I felt was slightly intense, but didn’t take away from the beer."	4.43
3852	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	Pours a thick, brown-black body almost like motor oil, with a brown head that hangs around for a while and leaves a little lacing. Really great looking beer.. Aromas of coffee and cocoa as you would expect from a speedway with a little more coffee than the base variety. Similar aroma as roasted, brewed coffee than freshly ground coffee.. Taste starts out with sweet chocolate , followed by vanilla and caramel, finishing with coffee and a roasted malt flavor. Medium-heavy body, but easy drinker that definitely hides the 13% ABV..  578 characters	4.56
3853	Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee	750ml bottle - 2016 vintage. Pours dark maroon red black with a dense creamy light brown tan foam head. Smells like big robust rich velvety coffee, dark fruits, super smooth chocolate, rich caramel, graham cracker, toffee, some vanilla, with a touch of balanced hops. Tastes like marshmallowy vanilla, caramel, dark fruits, dark toffee, graham cracker, dark chocolate, rich robust dark coffee, dark roasted malts, with floral earthy herbal grassy pine. Feels thick medium bodied, smooth and creamy with moderate low carbonation. Overall a really great imperial stout with Vietnamese coffee.	4.77
3854	Abt 12	Exceptional beer deserving of it's rating, a dark, crazy, high-spirited beer. Sweet, extremely foamy and just slightly venomous feeling, this beer will take you for a ride.	4.55
3855	Abt 12	"L: brown, dark, thin head with ok retention; looks rich
S: grape and maybe cinnamon
T: cinnamon raisin bagel
F: decent carbonation, lingers on the tongue
O: outstanding"	4.75
3856	Abt 12	look: brown red black. Smell: wetttttt. rye, candi sugar, baking spices, clove , pepper, yeasty.  218 characters	4.22
3857	Abt 12	11.2oz bottle best before A 03 02 21 poured into a St. Bernardus goblet at just above fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours bright light brown with ruby highlights and khaki head. Some lacing. The head recedes to a thin cap and persists. The aroma is fruity (cherry, red grapes) at first with dark caramelized sugar drifting in behind. The taste is semisweet cherry with cola, dark sugar and rich malt all popping up before a mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. No trace of alcohol in the taste or aroma. Overall, very good. I'm a little surprised with the fruitiness compared to the malt/dark sugar, but it's still very enjoyable. Now I need to buy more and show some restraint to review nearer the BB date.	4.41
3858	Abt 12	L: Dark cola brew with a three finger sticky dark beige head that dissolves to a cap and a ring that seems to last forever and with some sticky lacing that slowly settles. There are some solids floating around however.. S: Sweet malt, raisins and other dark fruits, with notes of honey, banana, and nutmeg. Great aroma.. T: Follows nose minus the banana and nutmeg and with additional malt and oak. No bitterness outside that tinniness from carbonation. Breadiness is not overwhelming. Booze is hidden from my palate..  786 characters	4.43
3859	Abt 12	"L - Deep, murky, opaque brown with a large tan head that sticks around leaving behind some lacing
S - Tons of bready yeast and sweet malt, raisin, dark fruits, honey
T - Follows the nose: sweet, bready yeast and malt up front and throughout, raisin, figs, dates, dark fruits, caramel, maybe a little cinnamon and other spices and brown sugar - slight twinge of alcohol on the back end.
F - Medium bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Light, crisp, sweet.
O - The definition of a Belgian quad. Amazing."	4.77
3860	Abt 12	Maybe a flawless beer. I've certainly never had anything that eclipses it. The perfect balance of everything -- malt, raisin, fig, carbonation, mouthfeel, etc etc.	4.88
3861	Abt 12	Best mouth feel I've ever had in a beer, but that's about the end of it.. May have had a bad batch, but wasn't the greatest flavor. Sat heavy. Gave me serious gas.	2.8
3862	Abt 12	"""Best before 3/11/22""; drank 7/4/19 @ the Yarchives.. Cloudy brown/orange rust appearance.. An even pour yielded a huge khaki head; a thick, frothy curtain of tree-rung lace..  497 characters"	3.5
3863	Abt 12	Dark Brown with a foamy tan head. Holding it up to the light reveals a slight translucence and possible cloudiness; The aroma is rich and full bodied; Nicely carbonated, tingly velvet; The flavor is rich and robust, not distinctive or identifiable, just a hint of alcohol. A very pleasant rich robust beer.	4.03
3864	Abt 12	"750 mL Bottle. ABV 10%.
Appearance: Dark brown, Hint of red, Very thin cap, Over a finger of fluffy cream coloured head.
Aroma: Bready malts, Caramel, Molasses, Root beer, Spices, Yeast.
Mouthfeel: Above medium body, Medium carbonation, Slightly sticky, Noticeable alcohol burn on finish.
Flavour: Syrup, Bready malts, Root beer, Brown sugar, Dark fruit, Toffee.
Overall: Excellent quad, Very enjoyable, Fairly well hidden alcohol."	4.33
3865	Abt 12	"L: deep ruby, almost opaque. Huge frothy head. Beautiful lacing. Belgian to the core.
S: Dried fruit, honey.
T: Honey, toasted malt, dried fruit, caramel, something deep, like pipe tobacco.
F: Bodied, with prickly carbonation. Dry finish, Abbey style.
O: Big beer. As it should be: bold and complex. Highly enjoyable."	4.5
3866	Abt 12	Beautiful rich dark ale color. Smooth at beginning and at ending. No bite, well-rounded flavor. Between Chimay Blue, Westvleteren 12 and St. Bernardus, I'd have St. Bernardus three times out of four.	4.49
3867	Abt 12	"Accept no imitations. Have fun trying to play ""head games"" with the serving glass... as that devilishly lingering thin film of surface bubbles steadfastly reminds you that it's still alive in there..."	5
3868	Abt 12	This beer was so difficult to get a hold of, because I live in a city that never has it in stock. Thankfully, I had a friend who brought me one. I cannot comment on much about it because I was enjoying it too much to take notes. Simply the best beer that I have ever tasted. Thankfully, I'm waiting on two more bottles, so I can take notes then!!	4.85
3869	Abt 12	From a bottle. Dark brown color with two fingers of fluffy cream-colored head. Rich floral and brown sugar smells. Medium feel. Tastes of brown sugar, dark bread, and raisins. Very smooth taste with some lingering warmth. Delicious!	4.64
3870	Abt 12	There's something else about this little number. It is a little inconspicuous but then hits you like a freight train with a complex nutty flavor and a creamy mouthfeel to die for. Limit two per tasting session or you might hit the floor.	5
3871	Abt 12	L: Pours a very dark red brown with a large fluffy tan head and thick creamy fingers of lacing on the glass.. S: Notes of grape, plum, chocolate, a light mineral note, some cherry. Very nice smelling beer.. T: Notes of grape, Belgium spice, a slight note of chocolate, some plum, a light mineral note, with a note of cherry and a light bitterness, very awesome beer..  476 characters	4.37
3872	Abt 12	"The color of weak coffee with a thick dark tan head. Smooth feel. Thick, rich, a hint of chocolate, malt, some plums, figs, spices maybe a cherry(?). Approaching sweetness with a tad of sharpness at the end to cleanse your tongue.
Edged out by the Chimay Grand Reserve as the best dark Belgian Abbey ale, but almost the best example of the style you're likely to find."	4.5
3873	Abt 12	"Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. Caged and corked bottle.
Amber brown colored body. Each pour brings out a voluminous, fizzy head that recedes very quickly. No coverage of lacing.
Aroma of banana, raisin, cherry, apricot, green apple, sweet light molasses, sweet bread, and cloves.
Taste is sublime and sweet, with toffee, raisin/pear/cherry, banana, sweet malts, tobacco, and cloves/cinnamon.
Medium to full mouth feel. Has alcohol vapors that percolate into the nasal passages. Very good carbonation. Prone to cause burping.
A tremendously tasty, and well put together beer. So easy to drink, even though the higher alcohol % is apparent. Best to drink at the recommended low to mid 50s F."	4.51
3874	Abt 12	"L- Pours a two and a half finger rocky headed ale with a nice live carbonation present. Dark and mahogany in color, with a slight amber tint.
S- Immediate aroma of raison, molasses, dried apricots, ripe pear, tobacco leaf, apple, toffee, yeasty banana, clove, red wine, brown sugar, and an aged oak earthiness. A nice juicy and punchy aroma.
T- Smooth, toned down and delicious. Slight stone fruit, followed by a sweet, but well balanced malty kick, toasted flavor, aged earthy wooden barrel, molasses, tobacco, raison, nice clove and banana, fresh apple and a slight hop bitterness. The 10% alcohol is shielded nearly perfectly, as there is almost no booziness to be found.
F- Medium bodied, wonderful lively carbonation, rewarding warm-smooth mouthfeel. The best mouthfeel of any beer I've had.
O- This is the best Quad the world has to offer, and it's in my top five beers of all time. You could argue that this is beer is one of the best beers ever made. Absolutely delicious, rewarding, and almost perfectly crafted. A near perfect beer."	4.76
3875	Abt 12	L: Poured into a chalice. Dark ruby/amber depending on light. Two fingers of rocky tan head that laces in clumps as it dissipates. It's gorgeous.. S: Banana, citrus, dark fruit (raisins, cherries), hint of malt, some booziness, finish is reminiscent of cider or sparkling wine.. T: Malt, raisin, very light toffee, notes of banana, raisin, plum, and cherry. A touch of hops that rounds out well. Brown sugar permeates the experiences as it is finished off with a not of yeast and booze. Just a tad bit of vanilla and spice (clove mostly). As it warms you get hints of banana and more breadiness. So incredibly well-balanced..  1,249 characters	4.55
3876	Abt 12	"Holy moly, this is a beast.
L- Huge caramel head, leaves foam clusters down side of glass. Deep chestnut brown.
S- Rich pudding-like spicy malt. Citrus notes with hoppiness in the finish.
T- Wow! Rich Xmas pudding flavours with a clear tang and vapour of alcohol right on it's heels.
F- Rich, alcohol, rounded.
O- I'd drink this again as a dessert-beer, as I might a dessert-wine. Nice and slowly savour it. Would go well with hot rich desserts, or cheese+crackers.
From notes made circa 2-3 years go, lost, so just added now. BB: 6/6-18"	4.52
3877	Abt 12	Pours a big creamy and rocky off white head. The color is very dark brown, essentially black. If you shit a light through it, it appears garnet.. The nose is raisins, phenolic spicyness, dates, molasses, banana bread.. The flavor is brown sugar, raisin bread, dates, molasses, clove, overripe banana. You can definently taste the alcohol, but it doesn't come accross harsh. Rather, it plays with and amplifies the other notes in the beer..  914 characters	4.57
3878	Abt 12	Bottled on 1/28/15. Pours a deep brown with noticeable amber hues and a beautiful crimson sheen when held near light; a large head of tan foam is about as close to perfection as I’ve seen on a beer, and is spectacularly retained; moderate thick, soapy lacing holds briefly where the head does relent. All-around brilliant-looking brew.. Aromas of candied figs, vanilla, plum, and toffee, all rounded with an ultra-balanced malt character; pronounced dark fruits and hints of brown sugar become more prominent on the back end; notes are all pronounced but never overwhelming..  1,463 characters	4.34
3879	Upper Case	On tap in Vermont. I do not remember where. Three Penny? Probably.. The pour is that of an NEIPA: Hazy, thick, and yellow.. The aroma is aggressively fruity and tropical. Nice, but, again, nothing too exceptional for the style..  324 characters	4.25
3880	Upper Case	Very light for it's ABV. Doesn't have the nose of some of Trillium's other IPAs, and is lighter in body than expected for the ABV. The flavor is there, notes of mango and pineapple abound. It might just need a bit more time in the can for the nose to burst free - I will re-visit if that is the case. For now, this is a solid offering with a sneaky light feel for such a big beer. I remember when 9.1% implied Triple!	4.42
3881	Upper Case	Outstanding beer, and very different. Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result.	4.39
3882	Upper Case	"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/31/16 (yes, I know it's old!) with ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN"" written below it. Sure, this beer was quite filling but the flavors, stickiness, and lack of any massive sediment at the bottom of the liquid led me to believe that this was a quality brew, even down to the last sip!. This beer looked like nectar as I poured it out with the waxy, hazy liquid being quite appealing and thicker than anything that I've had from Trillium. Hardly any lacing was left behind as there were just a few spots below a faint thin ring near the top of my pint glass. Lots of mango, papaya, ripe fruit, and tropical hops in the nose as this had quite a heavy aroma, albeit not anything terribly strong. More hops, grape, white wine, faint wood, and hints of a Wild Ale came through in the taste as this was much more complex than I was first led to believe. This malted out for sure but the Pilsner, and Flaked Wheat Malt held on along with some of the Galaxy, as this was not light in body and had little carbonation to keep things lively.... This wasn't light in booze either but it didn't knock me out at all. Nice to see Trillium not brew a beer that I couldn't see through or reminded me of their other offerings. Dry like white wine, I needed a bit of water to get this down when I finished it off...but that's not a knock on this. It was quite a delicious beer that I'd easily get a second time around!"	4.38
3883	Upper Case	Upper Case pours a thick, murky orange juice yellow with a small, 1-finger ivory white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell has a big tropical fruit aroma with orange, mango and grapefruit with a big bite of danky hop resin. The taste is sweet candied fruit inducing pineapple, mango and good dose of citrus zest with a creamy goodness from the raw wheat. A complex bitterness creeps in finishing rather sticky. Overall, this is a very solid NE style DIPA. Another great beer out of Trillium brewing. Cheers!	4.44
3884	Upper Case	Draught pour at The Smoke Shop. Nose is mute (opens up a bit once warm) , but the taste explodes with tropical fruit, papaya, guava, passion fruit, mango, kiwi, and some faint citrus. Creamy feel on the tongue and swallow, some ABV burn that drys the palate. Damn delicious brew, just wanted more from the nose.	4.45
3885	Upper Case	Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing.. Aroma has tropical notes of orange and grapefruit along with something a little more tart.. Taste is more on the sweet side of the hops with the tropical flavors dominating, mostly in the citrus range. A dry tartness is still present but smartly stays in the background. Malt is lightly present and bitterness is low..  676 characters	4.35
3886	Upper Case	One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Went to Trillium over the weekend and tried all the beers on the tap line including Upper Case. Along with Permutation 52 (mentioned in other review), this was my favorite beer of the bunch. All the others were amazing too (including Meddle at a close runner up), but this one had more complex flavors and smell. A great NE IPA style, very juicy, and very smooth for the ABV level. I live in NYC and can say this stacks up very well with some of our favorites from Other Half, Sand City, LIC, etc.	4.85
3887	Upper Case	Wow! Full on blast of overripe mango& pineapple w/ slightly tart resin finish. Extremely slick and thick. Carbonation bursts on my tongue. Outstanding Beer	4.58
3888	Upper Case	Canned 7/17/18, so a week and a half ago.. A: Pours a light, opaque orange with two fingers of foamy white head. Solid retention and a bit of lacing.. S: Candied pineapple, creamy mango, clementine, and white grapefruit. Rich and flavorful!.  601 characters	4.55
3889	Upper Case	Had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since I threw a bunch of brews his way for a party. When you open the can, it doesn't just greet you with an aroma, it jumps out and punches you in the face. The flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness. It's hard to describe all the flavors since it's like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion: really fucking loud. I get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin. Mosaic plays the lead role with Galaxy as an obvious supporting job. Serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed, but I never got any booze heat or warmth. Overall this is my favorite Trillium to date with Galaxy Cutting Tiles coming in a close second.. 7/17/18 can consumed on 7/26/18 in a tulip glass.	4.66
3890	Upper Case	Oddly enough, this beer is exactly as they described it. Thick, beautiful orange juice pour, Doughy mouthfeel, and loads of papaya, mango, pineapple, and doughy yeastiness. Very well hidden 9%. Really loved this. Very recommended.	5
3891	Upper Case	Canned yesterday, the day I picked it up at the brewery, 12/21/17. Pours a decent fizzy foamy 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, a little lacing, super hazy murky orange-yellow color. nose loaded with citrus and tropical, dankness, papaya, mango, pineapple, orange tangerine juice, a bit of biscuity toasty wheat and creamy as well.  932 characters	4.4
3892	Upper Case	I enjoyed this beer, especially the nose. The nose promised bright floral hop perfection, but after taking it on I expected the taste to be different. It is more earthy than I expected. It is a great dipa, but the taste does not invite the next sip as well as other excellent IPAs I've had from this fine brewer.	4.25
3893	Upper Case	Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruit with lemon. Taste is moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of lemon, mango, melon, pineapple, resin, caramel. As almost all of Trilliums beer very well done.	4.53
3894	Upper Case	Canned 6/5/17; drank 7/20/17 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque orange/yellow appearance.. A rough pour yielded a big, bright white head; decent lace..  439 characters	3.88
3895	Upper Case	Getting lots of mango, papaya, pineapple, some pine. All on top of a nice pilsner presence, with some fresh baked bread and wheat. Hop oils in full force, it coats your mouth aggressively, but with barely any unpleasant bitterness. This one is top class.	4.74
3896	Upper Case	"L: cloudy yellow, quickly dissipating head, some lacing
S: apricots, mangoes, and citrus
T: citrus, trop fruits, slight amount of pine
F: upfront mouthfeel, dangerous for that ABV
O: great offering from Trillium"	4.27
3897	Upper Case	"Had on tap at the Trillium beer garden on the Greenway. Nice, full aromas and flavors that lean towards the fruity pungency of Galaxy and Mosaic. At 9% ABV and $20/4-pack of 16oz cans, this is Trillium's 'best value' DIPA.. 89/100. EDIT (7/23/18):
6-day-old can. Appearance could definitely be worked on in terms of head retention and lacing. Nice orange juice body, though. Nice interplay between the galaxy and mosaic aromas, with both contributing a nice tropical fruit character alongside tons of weedy dankness and even a touch of fresh pine resin. Lots of juicy peach and apricot in the flavors. Bit of booze and yeast bite, but not too bad for the ABV. Good stuff"	4.41
3898	Upper Case	Look is cloudy dark stew colored with 2 fingers of slightly off white head.. Smell is tropical fruits like mango and papaya maybe and some pine coming up through the background.. Taste is sweet mango and other tropical fruits followed by a nice punch of pine and some bitter grapefruit as well..  505 characters	4.39
3899	Upper Case	Turbid apricot hues. Finger tall head that recedes onto an ever present ring.. Huge sweet trioical fruits, subtle undertones of grass, pine resins, and bread. The balance between the hops is amazing.. My my. Mango and sharp bittering pine. The bittering just cascades away. The flavors are even more balanced than they were on the nose..  508 characters	4.87
3900	Upper Case	16oz can dated 6/17/17.. Pours cloudy gold with a short-lived head and minimal retention. Aromatics are hugely tropical and dank. Pineapple, mango, candied grapefruit, white grapes, and weed. Medium bodied with a tacky, soft, resinous mouthfeel. Ripe tropical fruit abounds on the palate. Lush with mango, peach, pineapple, and pine. Hints of blossom honey and a mild warmth hint at the heft of the brew. Subdued malt and fairly dry for the style. Finishes with a slight sweetness and a sustaining tropical note.. Great beer, a bonanza of tropical citrus.	4.49
3901	Upper Case	"Look: Yellow, hazy, with 3 inch fluffy head.
Smell: Tropical, tangerine, and pineapple.
Taste: Tropical, tangerine, pineapple, and pine.
Mouthfeel: Full but hides the alcohol very well.
Overall: Another excellent dipa from trillium. Top 3 IPA from trillium for me."	4.47
3902	Upper Case	Pours hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is under-ripe mango, light orange juice, and dry white wine. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and slightly bitter...Makes for a good IPA by Trillium's standards...great IPA by most standards..I will get this one again, but middle of the pack in Trillium's incredible spectrum of ipas.	4
3903	Upper Case	"Hazy orange pour, looks like a ""street"" style Trillium beer
Tropical bouquet, mango pineapple peach
Lovely taste matches the nose with a slight hop bite mellowed by the sweet pillowy malt profile
One of the best feels to a Trillium beer, pillowy and inviting"	4.64
3904	Society & Solitude #6	"CAN
Hazy bronze; big pineapple, kind bud, lime zest + honeydew rind nose; mango sorbet + FCOJ at the start, lime + herb high notes in the middle, thread of peach, then a whack of mango, flowers + passionfruit that goes resinous to end; no burn, no IBUs, silky soft + dead smooth with clean piney linger.. 4.25 4.25 4.5 4.75 4.5. Drunk on expiry date - but that’s a (properly) short 6 week dating. Like all the greats, hits in stages. Gets all the best out of Mosaic (except maybe berries, but also no onions) as you’d predict. But what’s really shining through is the texture; it’s like Panna it’s so soft. No sharp edges; you need to pay attention to appreciate this one. But so worth it."	4.45
3905	Society & Solitude #6	Pours a hazy beige color with notes of orange. A big thumb length head retains well and yields rings of lacing.. The aroma displays several indicators of mosaic hops. Notes of berries, citrus, bubblegum, mango and peach. On the herbal end, there are aromas of grass and pine, subtle and significantly pungent like some of their other offerings.. Sweet and juicy with a medium bodied, frothy and smooth mouthfeel. The fruity flavors mostly align with the aromas, except that flavors come into play as well. A malt backbone that includes wheat and oats contribute to the creamy texture complimented by the gentle carbonation. Mild notes of pine and grass add a gentle spice. The finish is dry with flavors of spiced bubblegum..  833 characters	4.25
3906	Society & Solitude #6	Every time I go to the Hill I find, by blind luck, outstanding beers I have never had before. This a great example of being in the right place especially since this was the first time I had been to the Hill when they have had cans available. YAY for that. I tried some on tap and then bought 4 4 packs as it was that good. Smooth, very tasty. I would buy this every time I go there and I hope it’s available.	4.42
3907	Society & Solitude #6	"Served on tap at Melzingah Tap House in Beacon, New York.
A: Pours a hazy, golden toward amber color (think aged bronze) with a half finger, off-white head, rim retention, and complex, spidery lacing.
S: Very limited nose, but aromas are fruity with orange and nectarine.
T: Semisweet to sweet. Fruity, in theory, but much more coarsely grainy, in fact. Low bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
O: Palatable. Not in the top half of this style that I've tried, but I acknowledge I tend to like them fruitier."	3.54
3908	Society & Solitude #6	"Canned on 9-9-19, consumed on 9-21-19. Best buy date 10-21-19.. Pours a creamy, murky, dank looking pale orange color. 1 finger white, frothy head. The head retention is good, and there's a nice ring of lacing on the glass as the head dissipates.
The nose is quite juicy smelling. Citrus from the hops is the main aroma. Pineapple for sure. I think I'm getting mango also. More of a tropical feel to the aroma.
Taste - It's just a very citrusy beer. The Mango and pineapple are there. It finishes as more of a pine flavor.
Very creamy, and soft feeling. The hops linger, and stick in my throat.
First ever HF beer for me, and I wasn't disappointed. Quite a solid IPA."	4.56
3909	Society & Solitude #6	"Canned 07/23/19. Enjoyed 08/21/19. Pours a thoroughly hazy light straw colour with fluffy off-white head. Head lasts quite a while and there are significant sheets of lacing during drinking. Aroma isn't huge but has a nice citrus, melon hop aroma along with almost a white grape / wine characteristic of some Brut IPAs I've had recently. Was some Nelson Sauvin used along with the ""almost entirely"" Mosaic? Taste follows the nose with hints of sweet orange juice, melon, pineapple, and again that slight white wine. I say all hints because this is not a huge juice or hop bomb, but rather just a well crafted balanced IPA with many subtle flavours and nothing to blow your socks off or take over the taste. Some grassiness and sweet tartness appear at the end of the sip along with just a hint of non-astringent bitterness to let you taste those hops right to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately full. This is a very nice IPA, not as big of a taste as I've grown to enjoy, but refreshing & very enjoyable nonetheless."	4.4
3910	Society & Solitude #6	On tap at Armsby abbey. HAzy orange liquid, one finger creamy, rocky white foam , great rents ruin settles to a creamy solid white layer. Aroma is floral, tropical, pine.  286 characters	4.54
3911	Society & Solitude #6	On tap at The Bench. Pours a hazy yellowish orange with very little head. Lots of lacing. Great nose of berries and fruits. Pure Mosaic hops. The taste is fruity pebbles, pineapple, guava, mango and pineapple. Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel and some alcohol heat.	4.27
3912	Society & Solitude #6	absolutely incredible ipa here, the original style vermont ipa, before everything had to get all messed up. pure mosaic here too, in a way i havent known these hops to be in many years, like they have actually been juiced, insanely fresh, and like a concentrated version of themselves, its outrageous in both aroma and flavor, lemon and tangerine and lemongrass and pineapple notes, but also some tea and flowers and botanicals, like nothing else. a million or more beers feature mosaic hops right now, but none like this. just a bit hazier looking than expected, this is pretty thick and even faintly green hued, nice head on it, but not the brightest or sexiest looking ipa. who cares when it smells and tastes like this through, bursting with everything i love about mosaic hops and nothing i dont. i almost think for a second there is some lactose in this, not because its sweet at all, but because there is an insane degree of creaminess to the soft and expansive texture, like satin on the palate, like i want to dive into it. bitterness is really low here, especially for how intense the hops are, its its juicy all the way through the finish. subtle notes of marshmallow, french melon, and kiwi fruit here too. overall just a splendid ipa, they way these should be, and a leader in a very crowded style. this blew me away. dying to try the other beers in this series now!	4.46
3913	Society & Solitude #6	Does anyone taste Lipton Ring-O noodle soup at the end? It's more apparent from the can. It tastes really good not so much in spite of that aftertaste, but because of it.	5
3914	Society & Solitude #6	poured into a pint glass via draft. color is a deep hazy orange (neonish). smell is citrus fruits, mango and papaya.  229 characters	4.49
3915	Society & Solitude #6	So, the beer pours a rich looking, apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose, there's a huge aroma of mango, papaya, apricot and pineapple. The mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was also a bit less full than I was expecting, though I appreciate the fairly light, dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer. The finish is very clean in this beer, and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. So drinkability is pretty good. This is a very good DIPA for sure, though I don't think it quite matches up with the #7 version I tried last night. However, I think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this DIPA immensely.. Still a very good beer from the folks at HF.	4.3
3916	Society & Solitude #6	Look is a hazy orange color with a small off white head that is sort of thin and leaves quickly. Decent lacing.. Smells of orange, tropical fruits and mosaic hops.. Taste is a great mix of mosaic hops with orange and pineapple notes..  333 characters	4.61
3917	Society & Solitude #6	From howler (less than 2 weeks).. Beautiful bright yellow-orange opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam upon aggressive pour. Mosaic tropical fruit notes all the way. This is different than S&S #4, and closer to S&S #8. Medium mouthfeel but the really impressive part is how clean this beer is. Just very well done.	4.67
3918	Society & Solitude #6	"A-Pours a hazy thick orange color with a nice head and lacing
A-Aroma has abundant orange, pineapple and hops hints
T-The taste follows the nose with nice balanced orange, pineapple and hop flavors
M-A medium bodied well carbonated beer
O-A well balanced well made NE IPA"	4.6
3919	Society & Solitude #6	12 oz. Can. Canned 5/22/18 opened on 6/1/18 ss#6. Hazy lazy golden orange color, fat, all white foamy cover. Lots of lace on the misplaced liquid. Holds on strong.. A seriously strong earthy orange and pineapple aroma pops right out of the hops. Sweet and tangy fruitiness, freshly cut grass and black pepper keep it going..  1,090 characters	4.57
3920	Society & Solitude #6	Cloudy straw color with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a prominent grapefruit aroma. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit taste with a little touch of hops. Nice blend	4.52
3921	Society & Solitude #6	"Excellent Double IPA in a 12 oz can.
Pours a bright cloudy orange with a relatively thick white head on top.
The aroma has a complex fruity mix that is explosive on the first pour out of the can.
Juicy taste that follows the smell with a good level of sweetness and a pithy bitterness on the back of the tongue.. Great Beer"	4.59
3922	Society & Solitude #6	"Pours a light grapefruit color, gentle haze throughout. Nice foamy head that lingers. Big citrus bomb. Load of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, orange, some grassiness. Taste follows nose: sweet pineapple, grapefruit pith, lemon zest, fresh squeezed Valencia orange juice. Wow. Very nice. Carbonation is on point. Overall this is a very enjoyable DIPA. Not too heavy, not very malty, NE style, VERY juicy, not dank. Outstanding.. 3/19/18
16 oz can from brewery, dated 2/518. Thanks Adam!
4.5 rating"	4.4
3923	Society & Solitude #6	"(Review added 06/27/18)
From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery six days ago. Served in an imperial pint pub glass.. Pours a moderately hazy, pale, tawny straw-gold with two-plus fingers of lush, fat, sudsy head. Retention is better than excellent, leaving thick wads of sticky lacing hanging off the glass.. Softly sweet, bready nose of apricot, pineapple and proofing bread dough with a slight coppery tang..  1,399 characters"	4.2
3924	Society & Solitude #6	"Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew.. My 3800th Beer Review. 12 oz. Can
Canned On: 02/05/18
Drink By: 03/19/18.  808 characters"	4.88
3925	Society & Solitude #6	This beer out-tree houses Tree House. It was like a pineapple jumped out of the can when I popped it and punched me in the nose. Abner was my first great love by this brewer but I've discovered another. THIS is why I love beer.	4.71
3926	Society & Solitude #6	poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. pours a lovely hazy gold with bright white foam. strong lacing on this one. smell is an exquisite mix of dank resin, ripe fruitiness and a slight bit of pine. such a complex aroma for a single hop beer. taste is dank and fruity with nice bitterness. overripe melon and resin. so well balanced. feel is smooth, creamy and full. this is an amazing DIPA. complex yet drinkable. enjoyable the whole way through. pure Mosaic bomb.	4.58
3927	Society & Solitude #6	"Look: very hazy, bright orange/yellow appearence, white head with plenty of lacing
Smell: Huge tropical hop aroma, papaya, pineapple
Taste: some tropical/orange hop flavor that starts sweet, but ends in a citrus rind resin bitterness
Feel: extremely drinkable, moderate to mild carbonation, medium body
Overall: extremely clean while also having a big hop punch, nice balance witht he sweetnes but assertive bitterness."	4.46
3928	Society & Solitude #6	"Look: Yellow hazy with big fluffy white head. Has medium low carbonation.
Smell: Blueberry, onion, papaya, earthy resin, and pine.
Taste: Dank, Blueberry, onion, papaya, and earthy resin.
Mouthfeel: A little thin, well balanced.
Mouthfeel: Its not susan, but still a good IPA."	4.49
3929	4th Anniversary	16 oz. can. Hazy pale orange. Smells of tropical fruit and orange. Some booze. Tastes of zesty citrus, tropical fruit, oaty and chewy malt flavor. Boozy back end. Sweeter than the 3rd Anniversary. Possibly even boozier.	3.43
3930	4th Anniversary	Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a pleasant grapefruit with a touch of hops. Taste is also a pleasant grapefruit with a little hops.	4.52
3931	4th Anniversary	"On tap at OH for the 5th anniversary re-release. Looks thin with no head or lacing. Kinda murky but not emulsified
Smells unbelievable. The quadruple hop really leaves a mark.
Tastes a little sweet with a balance of hop bitterness. Ripe papaya, pineapple, herbaceous notes.
Feels a little thin. Not the full bodied brews I am used to from OH. Medium carbonation
Overall the smell is worth grabbing this alone but the beer doesn’t bring it home for me. I’d rather drink 3rd anniversary. And I will. Right now."	4.34
3932	4th Anniversary	Outstanding citrus, and a particularly attractive pour. Lots of mango and pineapple to the noise and smell. Mouthfeel is particularly chewy (surprisingly, in an IPA). Thick, very rich. Fantastic. My favorite Other Half beer so far.	4.74
3933	4th Anniversary	"L: Murky dark apricot and tangerine hues with a healthy white foam and intricate lacing
S: Tons of melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple on the nose
T: Ripe peach, lemon zest, oranges, a hint of smooth vanilla, and ruby grapefruit on the finish
F: Thick and soft mouthfeel - smooth
O: Well rounded and impressive. Man, I was late to the game on this one as it’s almost two months old, but if this has ‘fallen off’ at all, I dream of what it was fresh. As it is now, it’s an absolute monster. Full, rich, tropical, and mellifluous. Well done."	4.87
3934	4th Anniversary	L - as I crack the can, the tab slowly disappears into the murk. Pours an incredibly dense, pale, solid brick of dark yellow haze. Most beers you hold up to the light and they get brighter. Not this one. Almost gets darker like it's swallowing up the light.. S - huge fruity burst on can crack. Loads of ripe pineapple and sticky onions. Definitely some dank here. White grape and vanilla lemon/orange zest.. T - potent and pungent. Wow. Almost makes my eyes water as the flavor settles on my tongue... and settles... and settles... some serious lasting power here. Up front is forceful peach and lemon creamsicle. Sticky pineapple and green mango. Brief honeydew and lime. Pink grapefruit. Every flavor is packed with biting zest, dank onions, and booze. Razor sharp barbed wire palatables (yeah I'm making up words now; fite me). There might even be some brown sugar on the finish. Sweet like fermented fruit. Finishes grainy and ultimately dry..  1,405 characters	4.73
3935	4th Anniversary	Canned 02/02/18, not sure what stamp says.... Pours a deep hazy gold, with sticky residual lace and a frothy white head of foam.. Sweet and Dank. Pineapple, citrus, slight hints of booze. Balanced, smooth, awesome..  459 characters	4.74
3936	4th Anniversary	Growler from the source.. This one pours a very and milky yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing.. This one smells like ripe and pungent mango and pineapple, with ruby red grapefruit, marijuana, and pine..  697 characters	4.7
3937	4th Anniversary	L - typical OH, 1 or 2 finger head fades to thin layer with lacing, milky straw color, almost opaque. S - one of the most pungent beers I've come across, cracked the can at arm's length and smelled it immediately, leans tropical, more mango/pineapple than orange, smarties (the candy), hint of that 'green grape skin' I get from galaxy sometimes. T - intense fruit, nicely balanced sweetness, lots of grapefruit, medium-bitter finish like under-ripe mango rind, intense but not abrasive.  661 characters	4.67
3938	4th Anniversary	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; produced 2/2/2018 (GANGSTA - whatever that means). Re-reviewed on a can produced on 2/6/19 (DOGS IN A PILE) on 2/22/19 in a snifter and found it substantively the same as previously described.
A: Pours a cloudy, yet very bright golden color with a one half inch, white head, solid retention, and rings and rings of lacing all the way down the glass. On retry, lacing was more soapy.
S: Aromas of peach, mango, pineapple and course grains.
T: Sweet. Flavor of pineapple predominates over others in the nose with solid bitterness not at all overwhelming, rather beautifully complementing the flavor pallet.
M: Medium bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy and smooth.
O: Really special and really a winner. I am somewhat staggered than this much flavor could be derived from the application of hops. One more home run from Other Half."	4.7
3939	4th Anniversary	Purchased at the Koelschip Indy during an Other Hlaf takeover. Draft pour into 12oz snifter. Mind blowing brew. Couldn’t tell it was 10 abv. Hop juice with no bitterness.	4.98
3940	4th Anniversary	Canned about a week ago.. A: Pours a hazy orange with a finger of sloppy, bright white head. Generous lacing and excellent retention.. A: Quite aromatic. Peach, mango, a bit of pineapple and pink grapefruit. A bit of grassiness..  614 characters	4.69
3941	4th Anniversary	This manages to reach the highest level of hop saturation without being harsh or boozy even at the high abv. I liked this one best when it was first poured and still very cold... absolutely no booze and just the softest most lush fruit smoothie with peach, orange, and mango predominating, there is also like a big almost butterscotch sweetness and some herbaceous and slightly sharp green qualities coming out as it warms. Super interesting and well executed brew!!	4.62
3942	4th Anniversary	Tall can - 2/2/18. Great looking NE IPA, over hazed, on the lighter side of yellow squash soup, leaves great looking and plentiful fine bits of lacing.. Fruity juicy sniff, with bananas, ripe pineapple..  378 characters	4.59
3943	4th Anniversary	Best OH I’ve had. A close-to-perfect beer, and, a perfect slight hangover the next morning. The abv is hidden extremely well, jamba juice with a kick but you never forget its an IIPA. Can they make these for monthly anniversaries?	4.83
3944	4th Anniversary	slight alcohol burn up front(its 10%), but once that subsides, ..a sweet creamy juice bomb hits you like a ton of bricks..melon, citrus...thick mouthfeel..ist time having a 4x hopped IPA, and if they can be as all good as this, the world would be a much better place, easily one of the best OH beers I've had	4.55
3945	4th Anniversary	What a banger. If someone told me that this was 10% I would have laughed in their face. One of the best DIPA's I've had in a long time, perfectly executed, and worthy of the hype (which is rare with hazebro IPA's) glad I've got another can.	4.79
3946	4th Anniversary	Brewed with pilsner malt, oats and wheat; quadruple hopped with Citra, Galaxy, Enigma, El Dorado, and Mosaic hops, and Citra Lupulin powder... 2/2/18 canning... Opaque orange julius-looking beer with a few fingers of head on top... This is an over-the-top fruit smoothie beer to die for... A plush plunge into soft and smooth tropical juiciness, with tangy citrus notes and a mellow underbelly... Fairly sweet and only mildly bitter, but exactly what you'd expect from an NEIIPA of this nature...	4.68
3947	4th Anniversary	4 years? Where has the time gone?!?!??? Much of it was spent drinking big dank, juicy monsters and it was only appropriate that quite possibly the best of the bunch was this winner brewed for Other Half's 4th anniversary. Soft as they come, I could finish this off in one long sip relatively easily. Yes, that's how good this was!. As usual, this had a fabulous pour as the beer was orange juice, minus the pulp and with a perfect head topping it off. That lasted for quite a while as the lacing left behind coated the back of my Teku glass quite extensively. Loads of orange juice, soft hops, melon, blueberry, and an underlying dankness that came out as this warmed up. All of those were in the taste along with caramelized peach, oats, grapefruit, wheat, vegetables, and a soft creaminess that tied everything in together. A light amount of carbonation and slickness to the taste and aftertaste kept the flavors crisp, as complex as they were together!. 10%? More like 1% as I could drink this all day and night if I had to. I don't know they jam so many hops into a beer and have it come out as seamless as this but like so many of their other offerings, I just ended up drinking this in amazement. Dated 2/2 on the bottom of the game with GANSTA QUATRE underneath it, this was a lighthearted brew with a wonderful array of notes that paid a slight homage to the cat in front that serves as their unofficial mascot. Cheers to 4 years, all the good times inside (and in front of) their space, and to 4 more years of pushing the boundaries every week!	4.57
3948	4th Anniversary	"Canned 2/1/18 (), Enjoyed 2/6/18, Acquired in a trade.. Look: Dark orange haze, minimal foam, nice lacing.
Smell: Sweet sweet malt with near perfect bitter to balance.
Taste: Very sweet upfront balanced by a nice savory tang.
Feel: No presence of alcohol which is outstanding. Small resin feel on the tail end.
Overall: An unbelievable feat at 10%, OH keeps cranking out these monsters. Very enjoyable brew that is memorable. Here's to 4 more years!"	4.74
3949	4th Anniversary	Unbelievable thanks goes out to Robbie for camping out overnight and then handing off some goandpickitupformebro cans. You, sir are a scholar and a gentleman!. As for the beer, very good but hot dog if this isn't an ipa on steroids. The abv is present but how could it not be at 10%. That said, my jaw is on the floor w the drinkability here. Flavor is what you would expect from other half...they pulled it off...attractive and delectable hops in quadruple overload. Juicy, but boozy...congrats other half. 4 yrs and leading the pack as you have been since open. Happy to have been around for the ride. What a great time to be a beer drinker and an even better time to be other half. Not thier best offering but good luck to anyone trying to pull off a beer of this magnitude with this quality. Winner	4.5
3950	4th Anniversary	A: Straw yellow mixed with burnt orange falling somewhere in the realm of pale gold. Does QDH = more haze? This is about as turbid as their DDH offerings, so I'm guessing not. Fortunately doesn't venture into that super murky, bordering on gross muddy water territory that some breweries' liquid seems to express. Thin half finger of head dissipates quickly.. S: Fruit cocktail! Pineapple/nectarine/blueberry juice with a splash of booze. Pungent and sticky, like a peach that's been left on the counter for too long. Hints of green/dank/herb, but the fruitiness is the star. Lite signature OH nuttiness, but I'm getting more scallion and candied pine than the usual nuttiness. Feels like Mosaic is leading the way, but I can tell there's some adjunct malt in there keeping it soft.. T: Now that's outstanding. Wheat and oats come through big time to assist the hops in their delivery of an onslaught of overripe-pushing-toward-candied fruit flavors. Caramelized pineapple leads the way along with variegated waves of citrus. Sweet Meyer lemon and tangerine and grapefruit. Blueberry juice concentrate. Little bit of pine and some peanut skin bitterness close it out, along with the most mild ethanol flavor to help dry out all that sweetness. As with the nose, the hint of booze really gives this a fruit cocktail kinda vibe, and there's even less dank/savory on the taste to remind you that this is, in fact, made from just four ingredients..  3,177 characters	4.77
3951	Abraxas	"Pours very dark with an impressive mocha head. Aroma is chocolate and chili’s, roasted malt and a little yeast. Flavor is massive chocolate and fudge, ample cinnamon, sweet vanilla on the finish, Ancho chili heat is pervasive and light crating a little tingle in the back of my throat. Perfect. Carbonation adds to a creamy mouthfeel. Medium to full bodied, thick and creamy. Overall a very enjoyable beer.. 11/2/19
750ml bottle
4.5 rating"	4.44
3952	Abraxas	Look: black, whit a brown/reddish/tan minimal head. Smell: wet cinnamon chocolate milk. ice cream.. Taste: cinnamon sticks (not powder), anise, chocolate powder, roast, charcoal, red pepper powder, atole, horchata, more cinnamon. creme..  1,127 characters	4.57
3953	Abraxas	Bottle from 2018. Poured into Kane chalice and allowed to warm.. L: Beer is very dark brown. Small brown head with almost no retention, leaves no lacing or anything.. S: Cinnamon, spice, cocoa, roasted malts, a hint of vanilla..  990 characters	4.29
3954	Abraxas	750 ml. bottle at Monk's Cafe.. Pours thick near-black with a thin tan head.. The nose is milk and dark chocolate, cinnamon, maple syrup, graham cracker, and roast. Awesome..  394 characters	4.55
3955	Abraxas	I wake up at night wondering how this beer got so highly overrated. Who paid who? Purchase at your own risk. I can count for a day the number of stouts that surpass this one. If cinnamon is your special thing, I guess try it, otherwise don't waste your high expectations!	2.13
3956	Abraxas	"This just made my list of permawants!
Pours a dark brown with two fingers of mocha head.
Nose is predominantly cinnamon, fresh baked cinnamon rolls, vanilla, light pepper, dark roast.
Taste follows, the cinnamon leads the way, mild pepper heat accompanies it nicely. Vanilla and cocoa seem to balance the cinnamon kick just enough.
Full body, good carb level.
Overall an excellent brew that I will definitely look for again."	4.69
3957	Abraxas	Review #1000, picked something I know is good. A 750ml bottle, bottled in 2017 (I think 27th November 2017). Poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Dark dark brown to black in colour with a minimal brown head that dissipated quickly and left only sparse to no lacing.. Aroma: Cinnamon, creamy chocolate, carrot cake, and hints of chili peppers..  738 characters	4.47
3958	Abraxas	What an experience. Tons of cinnamon, vanilla and a lingering roastiness that balances the beer perfectly. Definately worthy of the high rating. The only flaw is the peppers could be a bit spicier but that is me being picky. Get this if you can.	4.6
3959	Abraxas	"This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a beautiful dark black close to jet black color with a quickly dissipating cap of a little off white to tan foamy head softly dissipating to leave some sly lace.
The aroma captured a delicate nuanced blend of ancho chili peppers, cacao nibs and cinnamon sticks. Somewhat seems to bring a slight toasty effect, dark toast mainly.
The flavor seemed to mesh finely but all of the way through the dark and milk chocolate sweet to bitterness gently flowing through the ancho chili spice and cinnamon stick. Quick semi-dry cinnamony aftertaste with a touch of dark chocolate.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. Good carbonation and ABV. Semi-dry with some cinnamon to ancho chili harshness invading my tongue. Nice finish with dried chili pepper to cinnamon quality about it.
Overall, what a damn nice imperial stout with a stellar creativity about it. Of course, I'd have this again. This is the cream of the crop coming from the state of Missouri!"	4.89
3960	Abraxas	From a one year, four month old bottle.... There's motor oil, then there's Abraxas. I mean thick fudge plops out of the bottle and pools in the glass like cooling lava. It's pitch black and one smooth mass. Above sits a thin espresso foam, creamy looking, and I don't think it's going anywhere.. Intriguing aroma. Starts off with straight booze and chocolate. Slowly, it morphs into what I can only describe as cola blended with a Little Debbie fudge brownie, complete with toasted nut toppings..  1,392 characters	4.29
3961	Abraxas	Bright and deeply dark brown body with a thin yet dense and creamy tan head. Beautiful aroma of earthy spices; cocoa; curry; chili; fresh ground coffee beans. The flavor amplifies the smells with additional qualities of cinnamon and a nearly whiskey-like booziness. Heavy body; velvety and lush; sweet but not sweet; warm but not hot; chewy.. I've long heard of this beer and have been waiting for a chance to try it, and, boy, the wait was worth it! This beer is a poster-beer for depth, complexity and balance, especially for dark ales. I can only say that if rich and complex dark beers are your thing (or you would like to try one), Abraxas would be a fine starting point. Now, if only I can find a barrel-aged version...	4.57
3962	Abraxas	"'10.30.17' is the bottling date for this 750ml bottle.
Nearly black opaque colored body, with a tiny point of garnet back lit light. Thin cap upon pouring recedes to bubble fed ring. The bubbles left behind with each sip slide back down into body.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, cinnamon, and slight whiff of peppers.
Taste brings forth the cacao chocolate experience, along with the cinnamon, and chilies. Solid malt foundation.
Medium plus mouth feel, somewhat thick and sticky. Carbonation brings along an interesting beer body surface show.
One of my favorites over the years. This one has faced a bit but is still solidly balanced and well mannered. Slight sweetness with minimal bitterness. The cacao and cinnamon are such well performing components here."	4.5
3963	Abraxas	Tasted on draft. Pours black with dark brown head. Aroma of cinnamon, chocolate and a hint of peppers. A lot going on for taste. Cinnamon and cocoa up front with some caramel and molasses to follow. Slight pepper finish. Very well done.	4.77
3964	Abraxas	Sampled the 2017 version in February 2019.. Pours a deep dark brown-to-black with very little head. The dominant note on both the nose and in the flavor is cinnamon. Make no mistake, this is a solid stout on its own - not just a one-trick adjunct pony. The heat is present but very, very mild compared to the cinnamon. The adjuncts provide the perfect balance of sweetness to go with the roasted bitterness of the base beer.	4.47
3965	Abraxas	"L: Very dark much like soy sauce.
S: Cinnamon flavor.
T: Very peppery ride with chocolate notes in the middle. Cinnamon more in smell.
F: Hard and heavy."	4.2
3966	Abraxas	Draft. Black with brown one-finger head. Smell is dark chocolate and cinnamon with a hint of pepper. Incredibly thick with a powdered cocoa feeling. Moderately sweet for the style. No perceivable alcohol. Low carbonation. Slight burn in throat by the end of the glass.	4.31
3967	Abraxas	Growler poured into a teku glass. Black motor oil liquid with a dense dark brown foam cap , recedes in about 3 minutes, few lacings. Aroma of roast malts, cinnamon, Chile’s.  281 characters	4.51
3968	Abraxas	L - 1-finger dense mocha head atop a jet-black body.. S - cinnamon, peppers, vanilla, chocolate. Just awesome.. T - Follows the nose. Cinnamon-dusted chocolate with a shot of vanilla. Peppers kick in midway and tingle on the finish. Low bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness..  345 characters	4.58
3969	Abraxas	It’s pretty bold to name a beer after this album, but if Carlos drinks stouts I’m sure it’s OK. It looks exactly as I think a big stout should look, ultra dark, opaque brown/black, yet it preserves a beautiful garnet overtone. The aroma is a bit underwhelming although it makes pleasant promises of well balanced coffee and malt. Then the taste brings the game up to world class status, full and complex but subtle and perfectly blended. To make a really great flavored stout of this kind, you have to start with a great base beer. This is exactly what Perennial has done in this case, it is, first and foremost, a really excellent stout. Then the other flavors are blended in with impressive expertise; the chili’s in particular are a delightfully ethereal aura of flavor. Feel is smooth and a little crisp. A very finely crafted stout.	4.36
3970	Abraxas	Undated bottle into pint glass. Pours a very, very dark brown with a thick dark tan head, which reminds me of the chocolate milk I used to make when I was a kid (heavy on the chocolate powder; you knew it was about right when the spoon would stand up by itself...). Initial impression is dark chocolate, cinnamon, a touch of chili peppers, and maybe some vanilla. Mouthfeel is rich and decadent. Alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden. Finish is slightly bitter but mostly chocolate and cinnamon. This is really tasty. I don't think I could take a constant diet of it, but for a once-in-a-while indulgence, it's outstanding!	4.23
3971	Abraxas	Flat out amazing stout. Alternately spicy and sweet, with a long, deep finish. One of the tastiest beers you'll come across. So good, I had to close my eyes with each sip. Brilliant!	4.91
3972	Abraxas	On tap, pours black with a nice looking dark brown head. Smell and taste are complex and spicy. Not boozy at all. Rich but not overly thick feel. Good beer.	4.27
3973	Abraxas	"Oily pitch black appearance with a small creamy brown head. Decent retention. A thin ring persists. Streaky lacing is left behind.
Smells of potent, rich, strong, fresh ground cinnamon; some spicy chili pepper heat, cacao, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, coffee.
Tastes of dark chocolate, cacao, chocolate syrup, but mostly tons and tons of cinnamon. A cinnamon bomb. Chili peppers creep in, too, and lend some heat that adds to the cinnamon spice. There is a subtle sweeter edge of milk chocolate and vanilla. The lactose no doubt contributes to this. Finishes gently sweet but not cloying. Feels warm going down, but the alcohol is incredibly well hidden.
The mouthfeel is medium-plus, not thick or chewy, but silky and soft. Moderately carbonated. Dangerously drinkable for its abv.
A really nice imperial stout. The pioneer of the Mexican hot chocolate style stouts. It's not longer mindblowing by today's standards, but remains a delicious and enjoyable imperial stout."	4.34
3974	Abraxas	Doing blindly with Hunahpu’s & Mexican Cake.. This beer is rather black but has brown highlights around the edges of the top. Has a caramel colored crown. Leaves an outer ring and an island. 4.5. The smell brings vanilla being the most prominent with peppers slightly tingling towards the back. The vanilla presence is like cake batter. Has some alcohol burn in there as well. The only one that seems to have cinnamon presence to me. 4.5.  825 characters	4.33
3975	Abraxas	"A - Pitch black with reddish brown tiny head that dissipates immediately.
S - Chocolate, cinnamon, peppers, and cherries.
T - Mexican chocolate, peppers, malt, sweet with a hint of cinnamon.
M- Thickest beer I've had; mouth-coating, with low carbonation. Some burn from the high alcohol and even from the chilies.
O- Everything seems to work together; extremely robust flavor; fantastic if you are into thick beers."	4.99
3976	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Funktastic old bottle that I split with my dad and two guys from NYC that we met at the tasting room outside of Brussels, Belgium. Beautiful atmosphere for a one of a kind sour. Definitely acquired taste but if you like the style you are in for a treat.	4.75
3977	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	2014 vintage; drank 6/22/19 @ Golgi Apparatus.. A delightful, fruity, balanced geueze that showcases the brewer's art to the nth degree. Had this in a share with a lot of heavy hitters, and it was my favorite. Can't wait to have another...	4.67
3978	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"L: Golden yellow color.
S: Very funky.
T: Soft and strong start to a chaotic and harsh finish.
F: Sharp and distinct.
O: Not a bad geuze but not as great as the honey blend."	4.27
3979	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"2014 Vintage
Pours a medium gold with great carbonation. Tons of tart, barnyard aromas and funk on the nose. Same in terms of flavor along with a stone fruit that I can’t put my finger on with a soft mouthfeel and low acidity and a crisp dry finish. Absolutely loved this beer."	4.71
3980	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	I've had a few Geueze before but I believe this is the one I like the best. Full of flavor, tart, oak, yet smooth and easy drinking at the same time. It is delicious.. Look: semi-clear golden-amber with a thin fizzy white head. Aroma: green apple, lemon, oranges, oak.  399 characters	4.51
3981	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Pours and unclear golden straw color, with fine, fizzy head.. Smell is tart and citrusy with hints of funk and mineral, along with lemon peel and a little bit of grass.. Taste is bright and citrusy, manilny Seville oranges and lemon. Hints of funk, champagne, some minerals and just a perfect acidity. Sourness and acidity are both strong, but never overpowering or mouthpuckering. Complexity is sublime..  572 characters	4.81
3982	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Big fizzy foamy head, good lacing, semi clean tan orange. Nose loads of awesome gueuze, good funk, tart, little fruit like, barnyard grassy hay. Taste more of the same funk, grassy barnyard funk, hay, little fruity like, just a great gueuze blend.  278 characters	4.6
3983	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	this has been a beer ive wanted to get into for a really long time, i know it changes from blend to blend, but i was able to have the 2017 vintage that has some honey in it recently, i believe the first time golden blend has contained honey, and there is a cute little bee on the label to designate this vintage, still comprised of 25% 4 year lambic. its incredibly effervescent in the glass to my surprise, fizzy like a soda, and even has some lemon and lime soda aromatics to it. i get the floral polleny raw honey element in the nose as well, not sweet, but obviously and distinctively honey to me, with a very mature lambic character, wheaty, more puckery than some others i have had from these guys, and with a great musty danky funk to it as well, bright and woody at the same time, musty and fresh at the same time, earthy and clean at the same time, its crazy stuff! for how little honey is actually in here, i am surprised how well i can taste it through the layers of various lambics in this blend, i get a nice acidic pop up front and at the end, with a more wheaty malty middle and some decaying oak, vanilla, orange zest, green apple, champagne, and wet grass in the morning. the integration of the different vintages is awesome, and the sort of concentrated funkiness from the old lambic is really evident. this really is an amazing expression of their fermentation profile, more distinctive here than in any other of their beers i have had. i know this one is pretty new, but i love what the honey does to it. it makes me that much more excited to open the super old one that exists in my cellar...	4.54
3984	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Shimmering burnt honey amber with a large, fuzzy white foam that clings in very large ridges.. This 4 or more year old blend is very crackery and toasty of sesame seed character with a super mature, mild sourness that at first contributes lemon, grapefruit, and complex spicy funk that is far more balanced and mellow than a younger blend might be. As it comes to temperature, cracked black pepper and apple cider develop, bringing this to a very comforting, old world delight.. Golden Blend has a medium body with a light froth and a tingly dry finish..  577 characters	4.36
3985	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	2014 Vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Drie Fonteinen tumbler glass. Thanks Emily for getting this for my birthday!. Pours a deep orange, lightly hazy body with a big, frothy off-white head with a yellow ring around the head that sticks around for a while.. Aromas are funky and musty, with oak and damp cellar, lemongrass and hay, citrus, lightly grassy and a tad skunky. On the tongue it's lightly tart with barnyard funk but not overly funk, oak and citrus, yeasty, a little bitterness on the follow through, drying aftertaste. Lightly carbonated but super easy to drink, medium-light body..  683 characters	4.52
3986	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"A summary of ""all"" of my FEB 2011 bottles that I've opened since ~2013:. Bottle 1: Can see the potential, inferior to A&T.
Bottle 2: Slowly developing, straying from A&T to Core.
Bottle 3: The same trend, heading to a stunning batch of Core.
.....
Bottle 9: Worlds collided and formed the perfect Geuze some time between 2015 & 2016, at or around five years since release.. The best Geuze are Golden Blend (if after Fruit Tingles + always carbonated), Armand & Tommy (if after the epitome of that classic 3F style), and The Seasons (if after a stunning funk-fest)..  708 characters"	5
3987	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"File this review under: Really expensive beer that I hate because it is so delicious.. Pours a slightly darker color of gold than your average gueuze. Super thin 1/6"" white head. Aroma is kicking down some seriously sour notes, what is missing is that plastic burning feel that 3F had going on for awhile. This is just tons of lemon like sour notes and oak. Mild funk behind it, not harsh, enjoyable.. A taste that brings out citrus notes without relying too much on lemon and grapefruit solely. Very sour, but not acidic really. Effortless drinking. The notion of barnyard can only be discussed by saying it must be a very clean barnyard, the farm butthole aspect of a gueuze isn't present, thankfully. I like this more than their regular gueuze because its aroma is better and it has more of a varied citrus flavor instead of just lemon sour power. Carbonation was on point. Interesting that the alcohol is 7.5% in this one compared to the normal gueuze. Can't taste it thankfully..  1,271 characters"	4.42
3988	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"2014 vintage
Pours amber / golden with small head.
Aroma has lots of funk, hay, barnyard, lemons.
Taste is lemon tart, hay, wet cellar, funk, little grapefruit, sour, wet grass, crisp.. 2011 vintage
Pours amber / golden with no head
Aroma has horse blanket, funky, hay, dry
Taste is oak, lemons, apple, tart, earthy.
L: 4.5 S: 4.25 T: 4.5 F 4.5 O: 4.5"	4.74
3989	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Tasted from bottle. Pours a cloudy orangish gold with thick white head. Aroma is sour, fruity, champagne. Taste is moderately sour but not overly so. Nice fruity tart flavor. Apples, lemon, yeast flavors. Crisp and tart on the palate. I'm not a huge sour fan but this is very well done.	3.9
3990	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Bottled on 2011; Poured June 2017. What a spectacular blend of sour (green apples, white wine vinegar, citrus) and earthiness (Brett, must, vinous oak) in the nose and taste and all perfectly drinkable as the pour warms a bit.	4.56
3991	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"Look: Orange, clear with 3 inch fluffy head. Highly carbonated.
Smell: Tart, light funk, and apples.
Taste: Slightly tart, funk, grapefruit, pear, and apples.
Mouthfeel: On the thinner side.
Overall: A good Geuze, but I much prefer Cantillon."	4.4
3992	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	2014 vintage, poured from a 375. Pours a golden hue with ample carbonation. Considerably more complex than the typical Geuze - crisp apple and funk. Would age very nicely.	4.59
3993	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	poured from a 375.... Look lots of carb on the pour, nice body. Smell: fruit, grapefruit and funk.  235 characters	4.74
3994	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	2014 vintage drank on 3/17/2017. Look - looks like a golden ipa with a bigger white head, nice body. Smell - lemon, other citrus, some grapefruit, some funk.  352 characters	4.5
3995	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	Loved the complexity of this beer! Look was quite bubbly and minorly cloudy. Aroma and taste had a great deal of complexity and funkiness. I did enjoy the vastness of this beer in contrast to the great but simple oude gueuze. Would definitely pursue this beer again. Not easy to find.	4.96
3996	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"Look: golden yellow with a light carbonated 1 inch head
Smell: big funk, lemon and citrus notes throughout
Taste: citrus fruits, floral and nice funky sourness
Feel: insanely light and aromatic... crisp and good balanced carbination
Overall: a real pleasure to drink"	4.46
3997	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	This beer looks about perfect--golden with a big white head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is complex and fruity, with just a hint of earthiness. Taste is fruity and sour. A hugely flavorful beer, and quite sour.	4.51
3998	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"Pours orange, with a surprisingly long lasting foamy head. Moderately high carb.
Smell is super unique and quite intense - earthy Muscat grapes, sesame crackers, celery salt, diesel and a bit of dried onion.
Taste is bright and sour - very Muscat-grape forward, with none of the strong cracker and herb aromas. Some sweet fruitiness - lemon, green grape, maybe a bit of sharp cheddar on the back of the tongue.
Overall one of the most intense gueuzes I've ever tried - unique and delicious, though some of the aromatics were a bit off-putting. I'm not sure if the bottle might've been a bit skunked or something."	4.42
3999	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	"2014 vintage (March)
-Dark orange flesh, hazy, with streaming bubbles. Fluffy head taking up half the glass.
-Stone fruits, oak, lemon, pepper, pear, brett.
-Tart fruitiness upfront with dry oak notes playing in the background. Stonefruits shine.
-Pleasant carbonation coats the palate.
As a person that's just getting into sour/tart offerings, I can definitely see myself enjoying these on hot summer days. Even if it means dropping $30 for 375ml bottles."	4.73
4000	Oude Geuze Golden Blend	We've compared a bottle of this one with Cantillon, and the difference was incredible. I like Cantillon Gueuze very much and I find it one of the best beers out there, but this is even better and more complex. Definitively funkier and moldier than any gueuze I've tried. Possibly the best beer I've had so far.	5
4001	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Pouring from a 16 oz. can into a Trillium Willi Becher style glass, this beer pours out like a cross between mango and orange juice. Forms a thin crown that dissipates to only an outer ring, attached to the glass.. The nose brings a beautiful citrus mixing with a very natural, sweet honey. Wow. The way the two mix are amazing. Mango, orange, peach, honey and caramel all backed by a dank background.. The taste comes in with those dank, pronounced layers of citrus tangling through sweet layers of honey and caramel; slight bubblegum wants to come out but never does with much pronunciation, just as an accent. There are some floral notes, but not too pronounced..  918 characters	4.46
4002	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	16oz can, breaking in the new Trillium snifter. Bright hazy golden yellow body, one finger frothy and thick latte white head, plenty of retention, lots of lacing. Looks positively appetizing. Smell is massive Galaxy aromatics- tropical fruit, grapefruit, mild herbal spice, floral notes, mild caramel. The honey isn't really present here on the nose, but on the palate, it's there in spades at the end and finish, for sure. It's a wonderful mild honey sweetness that lingers for a while. Mild-moderate spicy bitterness, otherwise big but relatively balanced galaxy and caramel malt. This is pretty delicious, and the honeyed finish is really, really very nice. Medium fuller bodied, good carbonation, silky smooth with a slight dry floral and herbal resin that is supplanted by a mild lingering sweet honey.	4.44
4003	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	"L: super thick, and crazy dark orange with complete haze. The head fades in less than 1 minute. This looks like while fruit purée.
S: a citrus bomb! Whole fruit with peels to add a touch of dank was a d balance.
T: just awesome. It’s all whole mango purée. Juicy sweet with Rhine peels in the finish to make the back of my mouth clinch and want more ASAP
F: so thick, creamy and smooth. Usually word I use for ba stouts with huge abv’s, but this is right there. Impressive"	4.69
4004	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	From a can dated 4/22/19. Up there with Minot's Ledge as one of their top Galaxy bombs. Does not have a heavy feel to it even at 8.5%. An exceptional beer.	4.65
4005	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Canned 8/16/18; drank 8/26/18 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Opaque yellow appearance.. Minimal white head; minimal lace..  326 characters	4.42
4006	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Willi Becher pint glass.
L - Pours a hazy orange with a white head that dissipates slowly.
S - Smells of pineapple and mango.
T - Tastes of tropical fruits with a nice bitterness.
F - Medium body and carbonation with a little prickliness on the finish.
O - Excellent double IPA."	4.31
4007	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	"Pours like orange juice with a finger of white head.
Smells sweet, honey, citrus, a bit of bubblegum, light pine.
Taste starts with the resinous pine, turns to sweet fruits, peachy, honey, faint bubblegum notes linger.
Medium to full body, smooth, amply carbed.
Overall a great beer!"	4.34
4008	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	L - 1-finger offwhite head atop a glimmering orange juice body.. S - tropical fruit, honey. Very inviting.. T - grapefruit, melon, tangerine, with just a hint of honey sweetness. Earthy middle. Moderate bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness..  397 characters	4.39
4009	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Canned on 10/11/18. Pours opaque, glossy honey gold with about a finger of pillowy, white foam that recedes pretty quickly in favor of thin layers of sticky lacing.. Aromas of raw honey meld with dank hops for an absolutely pungent bouquet forming notes of herbaceously sweet sugar cane and lighter notes of rubber; powerful stuff, and definitely an aroma I’m finding personally polarizing..  1,008 characters	3.27
4010	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience.. A world of thanks to Jon for this can.. Pint can dated 10/11/18 - poured into a tulip at about 45 degrees..  2,229 characters	4.48
4011	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there.. That being said, there are things about galaxy that I do like quite a lot. When combined with other hops, it tends to be a smorgasbord of sweet, clean, rich haze. Cutting Tiles delivers in spades - it's almost too sweet, but it doesn't quite cross that border in to syrupy, which is good - I cannot abide that in an IPA. The beer is still plenty drinkable and doesn't have that filling quality that I hate. The bubble gum/cotton candy tasty that many attribute to galaxy is not all that forward - it's there, but not offensive or overwhelming.. I'd generally prefer a Fort Point - but this specific variant of Cutting Tiles is quite good.	4.6
4012	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level. Phenomenal. Best trilltive ever and it’s not close.	4.78
4013	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Creamy-looking dark OJ color with a thin finger of off-white head. Nice lacing. Huge aroma of weed, earthy smoked herbs and nuts. They carry over the taste, coupled with orange juice, lime, pithy and piney bitterness and a peppery alcohol bite. Some hop bite, too. Full bodied with a prickly feel. There’s a lot of depth and ton of alcohol in this one, but the nutty, smokey quality when fresh isn’t to my preference. I am interested to see how it changes with some age.	4
4014	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	08/2016 - While I enjoy the base beer, the Galaxy usage is top notch in my opinion. That said, the honey does a nice job balancing the Galaxy; tasty, refreshing, and super flavorful.	4.46
4015	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Had on tap at the Trillium Garden on the Greenway a month or so back. Super hazy and golden color. Huge flavors of peach, citrus rind, honey, and resin attack the palate. It's very chewy and sticky in the mouth, a bit heavy in the stomach but still so very drinkable due to the flavor. This beer is incredible and the blend of wildflower honey with Galaxy was near perfect.	4.5
4016	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Can. White head. Super hazy golden sunset orange. Looks like juice.. This is one of trillium's best beers and one of my favorite NE DIPAs. It is so soft with no bitterness or burn. Tropical juice. Orange, pineapple, and mango. The wildflower honey must do something here, because the feel is incredible. This beer is way too drinkable for a double.	4.7
4017	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Would put this just below Perm 32 for me. I remember having Mosaic Cutting Tiles last year, and thought it was a mess. The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked. They’re knocking these beers out of the park lately.	4.71
4018	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Pours a very hazy, cloudy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to a layer and leaves spotty lacing.. Aromas are heavy citrus and pillowy clementine, fruity and Inviting. Taste is lightly sweet honey and pulpy citrus, tangerine, pineapple, almost no bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel - very soft and easy, I can’t believe this is 8.3%.. This is a real winner. Delicious and so flavorful, yet balanced and delicate.	4.58
4019	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, one week since brewing.. Pours an opaque soft pale yellow in the glass with a finger of dense white head. Huge pungent citrus aromas upon cracking open the can; followed by a light earthiness, fresh pineapple, fresh apricot, summer flowers, honey and a light wheat cracker. Taste matches the nose, think of a citrus marmalade w/ honey on a wheat cracker. At the end of the taste I get a little bit of ruby grapefruit pith and pine resin. Fantastic! I'm a big fan of honey added to IPAs and this really hits the spot. If you've had Buzz from Night Shift, this is that brews bigger sibling with a PhD. Super refined and smooth. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium with a little bit of prickly carbonation, low dryness but a medium- bitter kick at the very end of the sip. Not the stereotypical fruit smoothie, it's got both a detectable honey sweetness and ruby grapefruit bitter kick. I wish I picked up more of these cans during this batch!	4.63
4020	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	This beer has the beautiful yellow appearance of egg whites, which might be tacky if it weren't backed up by an excellent smell of citrus and peach and a delectable taste of tangerines and brown sugar. Trillium is on one with this masterpiece, which has a texture that feels thick, bites nicely, and finishes crisp. This is one of the best, and I'm very happy to be moving to Boston next year in large part of the guys at Trillium.	4.57
4021	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	I CANsider myself very fortunate to have been the lucky winner of a buncha CANs in a recent lottery on a different social media site. I merely had to pony up the cost of shipping, which was modest, in return for a buncha CANs for The CANQuest (tm)! I had heard of & was certainly aware of Trillium B.C., but I have not been trading in a while & so I did not give them much thought. I am now interested in drinking & reviewing the entire Small Bird Series, especially Pipsqueak Penguin & Stumpy Duck since I have an affinity for the former & a rubber form of the latter who oversees my drinking & will be in an NBS pic later.. Nowt to report from the stark grey & white CAN. 8=(. My last of the day for NBS (Week 659) began with a Crack! followed by a gentle Glug, revealing yet another deeply cloudy, unfiltered beer. Hmm. A vigorous in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of soapy, foamy, tawny head with limited retention, quickly reducing to wisps. Color was a milky, murky, cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM =4 - 5). Nose smelled of both tangerine/ sweet orange and honey, but it also had a bready yeastiness, like rising dough, that might have been avoided with some filtration. Mouthfeel was medium, but light for the style. The taste was kind of an oddball admixture of flavors, ranging from earthy, freshly-turned soil to sweet clover honey to rising bread dough to tangerine/sweet orange to a light alcohol heat that tingled my sinus cavity. Phew! It was certainly attention-getting, but it also had a graininess that left my mouth feel like it was coated in powder after each swallow. I CANnot help but wonder what even a modicum of filtration might have done for this beer. Finish was dry, but not overly bitter, more citrusy than anything else. I was glad to have tried it, but I was not as big a fan as others seem to have been, based on the overall score.	4.01
4022	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	[From Notes | Consumed 8/13/17]. @ Trillium (Canton). Glowing cloudy orange color with minimal head. Aroma is thick with fruity hop dankness...ripe passion fruit, fresh peaches, pineapple juice, and nectarines. Heavy fruity hop flavors, Galaxy bringing deep juicy apricot, passion fruit, and tangerine. The underlying spicy, oily pine sap and herb dankness helps cut through the fructose. Fullish, creamy, fluffy feel with a dry finish. Big juicy awesomeness.	4.36
4023	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	A 1 pint can, canned on 26th July 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.. Appearance: A hazy dark yellow orange colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left only sparse lacing.. Aroma: Orange, mango, peach and pineapple with hints of honey..  642 characters	4.32
4024	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Pours a golden hazy orange with a two finger head, quickly dissipating. Smells of peppery hops, stone, earthy, with citrus. Taste is a bitter bite into tropical fruit, juicy and sharp. Lingering bitterness on the end, little bit of booze burn. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy. Not getting much of the honey. This is likely my favorite of the cutting tiles hop varieties. Good beer.	4.19
4025	Cutting Tiles (Galaxy)	Pours a very hazy orange/gold with thick head and lacing. Smells wonderful, full flowery sweet, fruit, honey, light hops. The taste is amazing, this beer drinks so clean and is so tasty I am blown away. Flavors follow nose with bursting sweetness balanced by hops and floral notes, the combination in this beer is world class, one of my top beers to date. RESPECT.....	4.57
4026	Double Nelson	Can: Poured a hazy amber color ale with a large white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh hoppy undertones with some dry hops notes and some fruity hops notes is enjoyable. Taste is a mix of floral undertones with some dry hops notes, some light fruity ester and some light vinous notes. Body is pretty full with good carbonation. Really enjoyable but I actually had more expectation. I wonder if the single version isn’t better.	4
4027	Double Nelson	"12oz canned 9-17-19, opened 10-10-19.
1/2"" white head on a pale golden / yellow opaque NEIPA. Retains at 1/4"" and then a solid cap. Patchy lacing all the way through.
Grapes, earthiness, weeds - very clean, refreshing aroma.
White grape juice, zingy lemon, some herbal character - such a unique flavor profile...liking it more and more.
Medium to full body, medium carbonation and soft mouthfeel. Low bitterness. Medium length finish.
Very unique flavor, enjoyable and highly drinkable.
Very good. So happy to have been able to visit Hill Farmstead...highly recommended to all."	4.18
4028	Double Nelson	Had on tap. Cloudy dirty gold body with a thick white foam ring. Love the nelson sauvin hop and love what HF has done with them. Grape must, earthy hops, lemon zest, peach, slight grass, black pepper, and mango aromas. Taste has the same flavors but the malt meets them all in a dry cracker way, the combination gives the beer a dry, resinous, and elevated finish. Smell delivers more on the promise of the hops. Feel captures the dry earthiness in a matrix of a neipa, good juicy orange and yellow fruits.	4.4
4029	Double Nelson	750mL growler from the brewery. Pours a hazy place golden orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Sharp aroma of white grapes, white wine, green apple and weed. Herbal hop notes as well. First sip is white wine, green apple, herbal hops and weed. A bit peppery. Some doughy malts. White wine and grassy, herbal hop finish. Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Great showcase for Nelson Sauvin hops.	4.39
4030	Double Nelson	Pours a grainy golden. There's a dank note that you may smell in some parts of the city where youths are skipping class to take part in other, once questionable, but not decriminalized in some states behavior. It smells like week and there is definitely a note of it in flavor too. There's a quiet peppery bitterness on the finish. Overall, it's well-made, just not even my favorite beer involving Nelson from Hill.	4.03
4031	Double Nelson	Very good NE style IPA, that is, hazy unfiltered IPA which is in fact brewed in NE. It's called Double Nelson so I'll assume they're really trying to focus on the Nelson Sauvin hop. That white wine flavour which accompanies this hop is the primary hop flavour in the profile, and I've been somewhat put off by this in the past, especially with Brut IPAs, but here it is really well done, leading to a very nice flavour, smooth mouthfeel, and pleasant sweet finish to each sip. Hill Farmstead is off the beaten path, not the greatest to get to, & my god, do they take their damn time getting the line up to move through their brewery. I would say Treehouse or the Alchemist can move people through about 3 times as fast with the same number of staff. So, while I have enjoyed the Hill beer I've had, I doubt I'll make it back there again.	4.35
4032	Double Nelson	Double Nelson pours a murky golden orange color with a small quarter inch, white head, which settles quickly, rimming the glass and some very spotty lacing. The smell is quite dank, with a grassy, earthy weed and pine softened by citrus fruits of orange, pineapple, some white grape with some nice malts and assorted grains resulting in a creamy aroma. Wow! Nothing short of excellent! Lush and creamy over the palette making this very easy drinking. Hints of white wine, grass an herbal notes with grapefruit and pineapple with some pricky spiciness but a soft texture all the way through.	4.6
4033	Double Nelson	"Canned 7/29/19
Pours a decent foamy frothy almost 1 finger head with moderate retention, mild lacing, hazy cloudy bright orange color. Nose is pretty dank and musty for Nelson, but there is some grape skin, earthy white wine, light generic dank tropical notes with some citrus and a little stone fruit, light doughy malt or wheat. Taste mild doughy malt, creamy wheat I think but not sure, a little sweetness, enough to really prop the hop which come strong, with medium bitterness up front, then spicy like hops kicking in before fruit takes over, some tangerine and mild citrus, mild stone fruit with that, into earthy white wine, musty grape skin, again some dank musty hop characters with a little grassy earthy character, drying a bit on the finish with a medium-high bitterness, lingering dank white grape skin and white wine, with a bit more generic tropical.  1,193 characters"	4.38
4034	Double Nelson	Picked up a 6 pack of this at the brewery today.. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy golden orange hue with a thin one finger white head that leaves light lacing and fades to leave thin wisps. Wish the retention was better.. S - Aromas of grassy fields, tangerine, little bit of almost tropical dankness. Nice white wine grape aroma that is unmistakably Nelson..  1,016 characters	4.36
4035	Double Nelson	My scores just tell it all. Freekin amazing taste and look and feel good things for my taste buds. If you don’t think this beer is superior it is my humble feeling that you haven’t got a clue about finely crafted IPA’s. New England or otherwise.	4.78
4036	Double Nelson	Been trying to get my hands on this since trying double Citra. Very good brew but personally would still rather double Citra (probably due to my hop preference). Nose: Dank Weed, Earthy Pine, Some lemongrass, Strong Juicy Citrus mixed in. Taste: Dank Piff, Followed by smooth refreshing citrus, orange, some lemon, but the Dankness is the focus.  525 characters	4.51
4037	Double Nelson	12 oz can (canned on 6/10/19, Drink by 7/22/19, opened and reviewed on 6/14/19) poured into a spiegelau glass.. A golden color with light orange hues and a hazy, frosted opaqueness. Creamy white foam settles in eventually, with good cover and small islands of clumpy foam. Intricate lacing all over the place!. The Nelson Sauvin hops from Australia bring forth aroma's of: white grape juice, tangerine, pineapple, dry summer grasses and Grandma's spice rack. The malt smells creamy, with golden wheat and assorted grains. Overall a very deep nose..  1,443 characters	4.76
4038	Double Nelson	Pours an opaque yellow with a finger of white head. Head retention is good. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, mango, oranges and a touch of spicy yeast at the back. Flavor profile is tangerine, mango, papaya, passionfruit and spicy yeast. It opens up lightly sweet and finishes lightly zesty for a dynamically shaped experience. Mouth feel is soft and fuzzy, like a cozy, warm sweater. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet and zesty for a flavorful little experience pop.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can. Reviewed on Beers by BeerAdvocate.	4.4
4039	Double Nelson	12oz. can served in a tulip. Pours a bright, hazy orange with a loose, 1/8th inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a frothy slick. Nose suggests cannabis of the can pop. In the glass, aromas of dank, earthy notes, citrus and pith. Taste follows nose earthy/herbal qualities overshadow the citrus. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (cloudier to light) with a carbonation shy of bright and a mild acidity. Overall, an interesting variation on the style - juicy, but not overpoweringly so and not the highlight of this beer.	4.03
4040	Double Nelson	Solid IPA. Colored orange with a white head. Dank aroma with great citrus smell. Medium bodied feel. Very solid taste and great overall IPA. Solid at 8%	4.5
4041	Double Nelson	Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip glass.. Pours a hazy orange color with 2 fingers of creamy white head. As with most Hill Farmstead beers, the retention on the head is real, leaving a crown of lacing as it ultimately settles into a thick blanket of foam.. The aroma is extremely dank and a bit difficult to place. It's like coriander and overripe mango, followed by orange, grapefruit, and white grape skin..  912 characters	3.88
4042	Double Nelson	"12 oz. can.
Canned 04/22/19.
Four days old.
Moderate pour yields a 1.5 inch white head over a hazy light golden, straw colored body with nice, sticky lacing. Nose of orange, orange pith, orange zest, and slight white grape. Taste mirrors nose beautifully with an orange pith bitterness near the finish and then dry white wine at the finish. Very nice feel and overall, after having this on tap a couple times, it was nice to get a can and enjoy (and review!) at home. Cheers to Shaun and crew for yet another delight!"	4.54
4043	Double Nelson	Picked-up a single can in a trade. This is my fifth brew from these guys, all outstanding. Canned-on date of 2/8/19. Great brew, wish it wasn't 4 hours away, & would like to see transition to 16-oz cans.	4.5
4044	Double Nelson	Grassy and dank and just slightly bitter - but, complementary sweet, juicy notes make this a tremendous pleasure. Nose is complex and lightly floral, dank, sweet. Beautiful, hazy pour with nice lacing. Carbonation is just right - quite pleasant.. Nelson isn't even my favorite hop, but it's so well-utilized in this beer. It amazes me that some people will sleep on Hill Farmstead now, favoring new hype breweries. HF is still killing it.	4.71
4045	Double Nelson	On tap at Armsby Abbey , poured into a stemmed glass. Two finger white bubbly foam crown over a hazy orange liquid, some lacings. Aroma of citrus, mandarin orange, lemon, whiff of dank.  276 characters	4.5
4046	Double Nelson	Look: pale orange/yellow , 1 inch foam recedes tonthing ring with tons of lacing. Smell: dank wet earth and not much else; surprisingly muted nose in this one which is rare for HF IPAs. Taste: grapefruit and lemon ; and piney punch at the end.  569 characters	4.17
4047	Double Nelson	Loved this one, too. Perhaps not as good as Edward, but still very good. Here goes:. A: Cloudy yellow. Pours a massive white head with great lacing. Not the most appetizing in appearance, but still great.. S: Beautiful. Tons of grassy, fruit hops complemented by a touch of pine. The grapefruit is really prominent, but so are lemons, oranges, and tangerines..  599 characters	4.47
4048	Double Nelson	Opaque orange juice yellow-orange with a tall, slow to recede off white foam settling to a root beer float island leaving tons of lacing.. Smell explodes with insane levels of Nelson character--toasted sesame and cracker unlike any other Nelson IPA. Notes of tangerine, kiwi and papaya follow.. Taste is more cannabic and spicy with pine resin, yet still with that toasty cracker. An almost acidic quality of Asian and tropical fruits bring up the tail end, thinking longan..  675 characters	4.07
4049	Double Nelson	L - pours a glowing early sunset yellow. Mild haze with a floofy head.. S - grape must and kalamata olive. Hints of Cabernet and earthy wood. This is Nelson.. T - such a raw, primal grape flavor. This ain't your grocery store grape, this is something you'd find in the wilderness of questionable origin. Vanilla spice candles and honey. Grapefruit prickly spiciness with some serious bitterness. Vinous white wine and fresh herbs. Dill? Finishes a touch dry with more pink grapefruit coming out. Nelson has a way of being cloying or overwhelming, but the grassiness dries that right up..  825 characters	4.56
4050	Double Nelson	Canned 10/15, so one week ago.. A: Pours a hazy, opaque orangish pale with two fingers of fluffy, white head which leaves swaths of lacing as it recedes. Excellent retention.. S: Candied orange, light lemon, honey, A powerful hoppy smell that leaps out several feet from the glass. A bit of wood and spice..  742 characters	4.68
4051	Last Snow	Pours black with a one inch frothy light brown head that big blotches of lacing. Smells of coconut, roasted coffee and roasted malts. Tastes of toasted coconut, medium roast coffee, roasted malts, caramel, milk chocolate and cinnamon. Medium bodied, soft carbonation creamy mouth feel.	4.42
4052	Last Snow	Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with no dates. Served in a Sensorik glass.. Appearance: The one finger head goes away fairly quickly and dissolves into a thin foam layer. It leaves big patches of lacing all over the glass. It's a pure black color.. Smell: It smells strongly of coconut with more subdued (but still prevalent) notes of ground coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt..  957 characters	4.06
4053	Last Snow	A porter called “ Last Snow” from a Florida brewery (Funky Buddha) had to be interesting, but I never expected it to be exceptional. Revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight, and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee, chocolate and coconut, it’s no surprise that one person declared it to be like a “liquefied Mounds Bar.” And that analogy remains relevant on the palate. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This. And as it warms, it gets even more flavorful, making it a great choice for any Snow Birds in the Northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire. That said, Last Snow is definitely not a session beer. One and done at one sitting would be my recommendation. But if you’re a fan of those flavors, you’d be wise to keep a sixer on hand...especially if you run out out Mounds bars.	4.77
4054	Last Snow	Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smell is a lovely balance of coconut and roasted malt/coffee notes, with just a hint of cinnamon and earthy spice. Taste is an exceptional balance of sweet, lightly toasted coconut and caramel malt as well as roastes malt and coffee notes, with hints of dark chocolate, cinnamon, earthy spice and just a hint of licorice and vanilla coming through as well. Finishes with a very light bitterness and some sweet coconut and roasted coffee notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.. Certainly the best coconut Porter I've had due to the exceptional balance. The coconut is not too overbearing and balanced very nicely by the roasted notes and a good bitterness, as well as some light earthy/spicy notes from the coffe, giving this a perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. Also has a great, full and rich body and mouthfeel for the style and ABV.	4.45
4055	Last Snow	"L: deep brown/black, tan head, some lacing
S: coconut, vanilla, chocolate
T: follows the nose, liquid Mounds bar
F: nice mouthfeel, not too sweet
O: friggin delicious!"	4.15
4056	Last Snow	"Pours dark brown with a good finger of brownish head.
Smells tasty, coconut, chocolate, roasty malts. Not getting much coffee.
Taste is definitely coconut and roastiness. Getting vanilla as well. Lingering sweetness that reminds me of pipe tobacco.
Nice full body for a porter, one thing that typically detracts from my enjoyment of the style is a thin body, not happening with this one.
Overall a great beer that if/when I see it on the shelves hear I will definitely grab some more."	4.47
4057	Last Snow	"The aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities - this really does smell like a liquefied Mounds bar, Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: The additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there's that ""so sweet, it's somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don't need to have this again either way.. 3.24/5: Syrupy and absurdly sweet - perfect for the hypetrain crowd!"	3.24
4058	Last Snow	Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass. Pours a very attractive dark brown with a 2 plus finger khaki head that leaves nice thin wisps of lace.. Smell is roasty coffee, toasted coconut, vanilla, and hints of toffee.. Taste follows toasted coconut and coffee just dominate this beer and in a great way, vanilla and toffee lend a hand also, but very little..  493 characters	4.5
4059	Last Snow	Quite possibly the best Funky Buddha I have had, by far.... Right out of the glass it pours almost syrupy thick, what ends up in the pint is black with a thick tan-colored foam. That foam was something to look at - never have I witnessed a creamy-looking foam - this was creamy unlike anything else I have ever seen. The scent was reminiscent to sweet Cuban coffee with even the same soft touch of bitterness - truly exceptional. Mouthfeel was carbonated but creamy, no dry finish to this drink. The taste made me think it would be boozy, maybe it should have been, but at 6.4% ABV it's almost sessionable. This is frankly a very good beer, one that I didn't think much from the label art, but as they say, never judge a beer by it's bottle or can or its label art...	4.32
4060	Last Snow	Whoa! this is expensive for Non Imperial Stout. I forked out 5$ for a single 12 oz. bottle. I'm a fan of Funky Buddha & what they do for the Florida craft beer scene. There is interesting looking chocolate snowman artwork on the label. Wow! I am getting big coconut aroma from this beer. I am not seeing any DATE ON THE BOTTLE. A beer that has coffee & coconut adjuncts needs to have a date on the bottle somewhere. I am ascertaining big coconut, slight coffee. I can't lie to you this is scrumptious. If you like a sweet stout that does not have lactose added to it then this is up your alley although it is costly, but I don't downgrade beer because of their price. Pretty good porter that almost feels like a full bodied roasty stout. This is a sweet stout all the way with slight roasted malts, this is a beer that I would not session due to the sweetness of the coconut & the edginess of the coffee but it's a great one time, one bottle treat for the evening, but it's definitely not something that I would want to session Cheers! A-	4.31
4061	Last Snow	The beer pours a nice creamy brown head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a delicious looking dark brown chocolate with a nice texture to it. It looks nice.. The smell is good. It has a powerful coconut and vanilla creamy smell that it is still amazingly good even after having been bottled after a while.. The taste is good. It has the same creamy vanilla and coconut notes with a nice coffee and chocolate in the finish..  563 characters	4.36
4062	Last Snow	12oz bottle. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of coconut, roasted coffee and caramel. Strong coconut flavor with a mild coffee, chocolate and caramel finish.	4.34
4063	Last Snow	Smells like coconut. Tastes like coconut up front, then coffee, then a little more coconut on the back end, all with a nice, roasty porter taste underlying it all. Fantastic. Never had a beer with this low an ABV (6.4%) that had such good adjunct flavor. If I lived in Florida, I would drink this all year.	4.35
4064	Last Snow	What do you have for breakfast in Florida? Well, I'm going with this. Sitting on a balcony looking at the beach I'm pouring this from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out beautiful for the style looking like coffee with highlights and not being too dark for a porter. Forms a great dense and creamy tan colored crown. The smell is a bomb of excellent coconut. Fresh coconut mixing with beautiful chocolate. Wow this could be a candle. The taste comes in with strong but good coffee and turns into that great coconut that lingers long after it's gone. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style with good carbonation and not too thick or thin. Perfect. This is an absolutely great porter that I wouldn't change anything about. But I will State one thing before I go! I would STILL choose a Death by Coconut over this!!!! I'm out!!!!	4.83
4065	Last Snow	Another coconut bomb for sure. Not artificial tasting at all and would love to get my hands on more if I have the chance. Hoping they distribute this up here soon.	4.56
4066	Last Snow	12 oz bottle from Total Wine in Bradenton, FL.. Pours a beautiful tar black into my Funky Buddha snifter with a fingernail of brown head that dissipates as soon as it forms.. Rich aromas of toasted coconut, chocolate, coffee, and winter spice. Slight peppermint..  993 characters	4.16
4067	Last Snow	Not a big coconut fan so this one was bought purely as a top 250 tick. Expectations of personally liking it are low.... L - look is thin but head is nice and frothy for 6.4%.. S - smell is sunscreen lotion with a surprising amount of dark toasty stout underneath the potent aromas or Hawaiian tropic spf 30..  902 characters	3.98
4068	Last Snow	Can’t read the bottled on date. Rubs off after 01/... but I’m assuming it’s 2018. Really wish I bought a bomber of this instead of a 12oz bottle. It’s superb. I usually pass on beers with coconut in them but this makes me reconsider. So well done all around. The nose is so inviting, the flavors are incredible, and the body is soooo smooth and creamy. I actually passed by this several times when I was first in Florida and now I honestly question my own judgement. Divine!	4.7
4069	Last Snow	12oz bottled 1/29/18 (6 months ago) poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 6.4% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is strong with coconut hitting first and coffee trailing behind. The taste is coconut forward as well with dark roasted malt coming in second. The coffee is just barely there in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated and still mostly dry in the finish. Really a masterful job of not letting the coconut sweetness get cloying. Overall, very good. I was not able to read the bottle date (black ink on brown bottle on dark beer) until the beer was poured. Really wish I could try it fresher as I am a much bigger fan of coffee than coconut.	4.34
4070	Last Snow	An incredible porter. Worthy of praise. You will not believe this beer is only 6.4% ABV. The beer pours a solid dark brown with medium mouthfeel. The coconut comes through immediately in the smell, and the taste is coconut/coffee with a smooth finish. The next time you're debating whether to go full blast with that imperial stout, have one (or more) of these instead.	4.86
4071	Last Snow	L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a half inch of creamy, tan-colored, fairly long-lasting head. Below average lacing.. S: A very alluring aroma of coffee, coconut, roasted malt, chocolate, and a bit of hops.. T: Tasted of a little bit of roasted malt (mostly in the finish), a tinge of hops, lots of coconut, a good shot of coffee (very much present), and a decent shot of chocolate. This is an incredibly well-balanced and focused flavor. It's never overpowering and easy to drink. Extremely tasty..  725 characters	4.49
4072	Last Snow	"12 ounce bottled on 1/29/2018. Poured into tulip. Excited to rate this longtime want.
Pours a dark and mysterious black with almost 1 finger of medium brown head. The nose is everything I imagined it could/would be. Coconut stands out but melds well with chocolate and faint roast. Moving onto the taste...while it has much of the same characteristics of the nose, it's not quite as strong. Solid coconut backbone, cheap chocolate and some roast. It IS a liquid mounds bar, just not quite as intense. Coconut lingers in the aftertaste. The body is medium and creamy with enough carbonation to wash away most of the flavor. Overall, The nose just kills it for this beer, well done. Just wished the taste matched the intensity of the nose. I'm still glad to have crossed off a longtime want and would definitely get this beer again."	4.37
4073	Last Snow	Came a deep dark cola color with a half finger creamy deep beige head that never really settles.Dark brown sugar,vanilla/caramel,and toasted coconut in the nose,somewhat sweet but it's inviting.A mix of chocolate and coconut hits ya upfront on the palate with a lingering brown sugar and roasted note in the finish.I'am not a fan of coconut at all but this liquid Mounds bar is fantastic,there is so alot more than chocolate and coconut going on here...Very nice.	4.29
4074	Last Snow	"Pours quite dark, nice creamy head. Aroma is predominantly coconut and coffee, with bit of a little yeasty aroma. Flavor follows nose, coconut is tasting a little artificial, but I still like it. Nice coffee flavor mixed in there, slightly dry finish with lingering coffee. Carbonation adds to creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is a fun beer, not too heavy. Looking forward to another 4-pack or two next season.. 3/27/18
12 oz bottle
4.25 rating"	4.24
4075	Last Snow	Opaque dark brown color with a thin tan head. Lots of toasted coconut on the nose, rounded out with roasty malt. The taste again featured huge coconut but again it was nicely balanced with chocolate, coffee, and almond notes. Medium-bodied and slightly sweet on the finish. In the era a high abv pastry stouts, this one packs huge flavor into a small package.	4.32
4076	Hopslam Ale	2019 version poured from a 12oz can into a pint glass. My sampling occured in January when this was fresh. While there seems to be slight variation of flavor on this beer from year to year I enjoy this greatly each year. Lotsa hops with a touch of sweetness.	4.5
4077	Hopslam Ale	Bell's is bad-ass! What can you say? This is a text book phenomenal 2X IPA. But better than most. An absolute legend in our great brewing state of Michigan. The only thing hurting Hopslam(and most great beers) nowadays is the price gouging! The beer stores here are ruthless and almost criminal if it weren't for the people buying it from them! I seek out the fair-priced honest beer stores and avoid the shysters! Two thumbs up!!	4.85
4078	Hopslam Ale	An amazing achievement: so rich and full of fruity flavor, without feeling oily and seeet, and despite the high ABV, the alcohol isn’t too present. A real heavyweight, flavorwise. Be careful, though, the ABV will eventually get you.	4.45
4079	Hopslam Ale	Looks like an amber ale really; just a touch of light haze, fluffy off-white head fades down to a thin film moderately quickly - some pretty decent lacing during drinking. Aroma of sweet caramel malt & piney hops. Not much of anything in the fruit department. Taste follows with a smack of piney hop & full malt backbone. Sip ends with a long lingering boozy taste & feel - pleasant but definitely also letting you know it's packing a 10.2% ABV. I don't taste the honey per se, but there is a hint of sweetness - maybe a tinge of strawberry? - which is barely tasted, but seems to dampen the potential astringency of the hops. Not sure what I expected from this - certainly a classic I've never tried before, from a time before fruity NEIPAs - the better of which I've really come to prefer. I would definitely have this again, it's a great beer, but I'm also fine crossing it off my list & not worrying about seeking it out again.	4.13
4080	Hopslam Ale	Poured from a 12oz can into a Teku glass. (thanks to Rocktire for this one). L - Poured a nice burnt orange color with a thick foam white head and plenty of lacing.. S - Slightly metallic smell. Big on the hops with a bit of beadyness..  555 characters	3.97
4081	Hopslam Ale	A: crystal clear; honey colored; 1 finger finely pored off white head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;. S: grapefruit, pine, orange, and a little bitterness;. T: subdued at first; from the middle through the finish, there is a delicate balance between the honey sweetness, the hop bitterness, and a strawberry/raspberry essence;.  510 characters	4.25
4082	Hopslam Ale	"Look- a little bit hazy and a little bit juicy. Formed about a two inch head
Smell- absolutely exilirating. One of the best smelling beers I’ve had. Citrus, pine and a barrage of tropical bliss
Taste- a perfect balance of bitter and tropical with a bit of warming from the abv
Feel- I’d a classic west coast ipa perfected
Overall- a true world class beer. A shame you can only get it once a year"	5
4083	Hopslam Ale	I grabbed a single of this just to see what it's like. It's kind of like an old big boozy Two Hearted Ale. A bit syrupy and sweet, hoppy but not hop forward or dominant, very malty but not in a bad way. It's not bad but I wouldn't seek it out again. nb	3.5
4084	Hopslam Ale	"L - Poured light amber with a thick 3-finger, off-white head. Fantastic lacing.
S - Piney and malt. Some orange.
T - Follows the nose.
F - Pretty smooth. Medium bodied. Light dry finish.
O - Not as thick or heavy as most DIPA’s. Deceivingly easy to drink for 10%. Love the way this beer looked. A knockout of a beer!"	4.46
4085	Hopslam Ale	From Bine and Vine in San Diego - canned Jan 16/19. Pours a nice golden caramel colour with 1 and 1/2 fingers tight off white head. Aroma of caramel malt/honey, then citrus/grapefruit, slightly floral, hoppy pine notes. Taste is at once sweet and hoppy - subtle bitterness builds to a perfect crescendo of grapefruit, orange, pine with honey sweetness in back. Mouthfeel is full, smooth, slightly syrupy - leaves with beautiful balance of bittersweet and just a touch of the 10% booziness.	4.39
4086	Hopslam Ale	"12 oz can, packaged on ""011619."". The mighty Hopslam! I've heard so much about this beer over the years. Lots of good, lots of bad. And, now that Bell's distributes to NJ, it's time to check it out for myself. Let's dive in!. Great looking beer in the glass. Somewhere in between deep gold and pale amber. Slight haze. Large, frothy, persistent white head that leaves behind a good amount of lacing..  1,003 characters"	4.05
4087	Hopslam Ale	First one I had was amazing, as youd expect. The second one must have gone south, there was a large rubbing alcohol smell off the beginning and through the rest as I drank it out of a snifter. I only drank 2/3 of it.	4.5
4088	Hopslam Ale	Can date 1-4-19. Pours a dark gold. I can see through my glass, a hop slam branded tulip glass! Strong citrus smell on the nose. Also get some pine. Get honey, some orange and pine on my first sip. More like a gulp. Quite a bit of lacing on the glass as the head subsided. Silky mouthfeel. Love love this beer every year. Wish they made it year round.	4.5
4089	Hopslam Ale	PA-POW! This little number meets all of it's lofty hype and reputation. Powerful 10% ABV is fairly well hidden in this hoppy and malty sensation. Have one. Seriously, maybe just one.	4.55
4090	Hopslam Ale	(2019). A: Pours a light copper-orange when held to the light. Has a quickly dissipating white foam head.. S: The honey actually comes through a little bit, along with a faint floral aroma..  964 characters	4.04
4091	Hopslam Ale	Poured a transparent copper with a finger high head. I must admit, I neglected to read that this is a double brewed with honey, so I wasn't expecting the honey to be worked into the bouquet. It wasn't cloying, and turned out to be quite the harmonious aspect on the palate, balancing out the deep piney bitterness and working well with the citrus rind. Good snag, as always with Bells.	4.15
4092	Hopslam Ale	Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Came in a tulip glass with about a half inch of foamy head. Crystal clear copper color and decent, soapy lacing. The aroma hit me from the moment it hit the table. Nice and floral and fruity and very citrus forward. The flavor is in the pocket for a double IPA. Great beer, would drink again in a heartbeat.	4.43
4093	Hopslam Ale	Serving: 12 oz can (stamped “PKGD 23:28 011719”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.. Appearance: Clear, bright bronze gold color with a towering head of white bubbly foam. Heads holds well and leaves and intricate lace pattern.. Smell: Pine needles and citrus zest (lemon, grapefruit) rounded out by warmer caramel malt and fruity hop notes. Faint hints of alcohol sneak through..  742 characters	4.48
4094	Hopslam Ale	Pours a very hazy amber color with a thick foamy head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. Aroma is light on the nose but get citrus, caramel, honey, and some pine. Very floral taste with slight caramel and honey finish. Bitter, slightly piney aftertaste. Slightly astringent. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very well balanced. Slightly boozy.	4.25
4095	Hopslam Ale	"12oz can. Brew date 01/07/19. Poured into English pint glass.
Very light copper hue with a touch of gold. Thin white head disappears to just cover the surface clinging to glass.
Pine hop scent with a citrus chaser.
I am an IPA novice so I prefer a bit less on the IBU scale. This beer lands right in my wheelhouse with a bite of hop with a smooth slightly rich yet clean taste and finish. The 10% is nowhere to be found giving it an insane drinkablity.
Just enough fizz to tingle the tongue with a easy medium feel.
Honey plays a part in this beer and for me creates a very unique imperial IPA that I very much enjoy.
I try to rate a beer as it is, not as it could or should be. Yes it’s expensive but well worth the cost, especially to share and surprise a fellow beer drinker."	4.52
4096	Hopslam Ale	This was a very very very good beer. For some reason, the huge honey flavor makes me think of it as more of a day drinking beer (maybe on a somewhat warm summer day on the beach) than something to drink at night.	4.5
4097	Hopslam Ale	"L- Pours a nice rocky two finger headed Imperial IPA with an amber-gold appearance. The liquid is all together clear.
S- Wonderful hop presence throughout. Grassy, piney, floral, and citrusy hops are all present. An extremely inviting aroma that is very sweet. Very little alcohol picked up, if any. For 10.00 that's insane.
T- The taste is extremely well thought out, and surprisingly refreshing for an imperial IPA. Citrusy and fruity hops make up for a sweet and malty flavor immediately. The flavor is abrupt, refreshing, and memorable.
F- Medium bodied, but extremely fresh and rewarding. Nice carbonation at the end.
O- Probably the best imperial IPA I have every had. It packs a punch alcohol wise, and you can't even tell there is any there... A bit dangerous I could say. But it's pretty astonishingly refreshing. The hop presence is lively and fresh, and it's as sweet as you could imagine. Altogether beautifully made beer. I loved every sip of it."	4.35
4098	Hopslam Ale	I’m an imperial IPA snob....,and I like em with a bit more IBU.....but this one, I’ll make an exception, it’s a great dub IPA!. Excellent from start to finish.	4.67
4099	Hopslam Ale	"Picked up only one can because of the price, but will definitely get more. Impressive!. Pours a very clear light amber with a medium head that lingers for a long time.
Smell: light, sweet, hoppy, dried fruit
Taste: stronger than smell. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Bitterness lingers on the palate but with rich flavor. Notes are honey, dried fruit, pear, floral, mild pine, and a touch earthy. At 10%, the alcohol is very noticeable. The honey adds a nice balance of sweetness that is not overbearing.
Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and full-bodied.. Very nice IIPA! Definitely worth looking for. Price tag is high, so good for special occasions."	4.38
4100	Hopslam Ale	Looks quite beautiful, with an off-white pinky of foam and generous bubbles rising. A deep amber on this beer, nearly verging on a red ale's color. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving behind bountiful lace. On the nose it's round, sweet, and spicy. Milder than I imagined, but altogether supremely well balanced. A cacophony of flavor from the get-go, with the best texture to a beer I've perhaps ever tasted. Utterly creamy and decadent, with significant grassy and malty notes to go around. Strong taste of weed, much like a Stella has, but with a good wheaty kick at the end. The beer keeps on giving, with something new to taste every sip. Ultimately, I will have to drink this with food. There's simply too much flavor to stand on its own, and I'm getting overstimulated with each taste. If this is your jam, pick up this beer. It's really something, and I'm terrifically impressed by Bell's yet again.	4.14
4101	Saison Bernice	May be one of my favorites of all time. Lucky enough to have two bottles of this on two separate occasions while in Berlin. Muted Horn has an outstanding selection and partnerships with some of the best around the world. Must try/bucket list. I am not a fan of Brett but this beer is unreal.	5
4102	Saison Bernice	Much thanks to John for sending me on my way with this in tow. I can't find any date info on the bottle itself, but I want to say he told me it was a 2016? I could well be making that up, but that's the year that sticks in my mind for whatever reason. It's somewhere between batch 5 and 15 as best as I can sleuth up. Yeah, narrows it down a lot.... An aggressive pour gives me a golden yellow bauble that still has some opacity to it. A nice finger of white fuzzy head is dissipating in front of my eyes, but leaves at least some residual to appreciate.. Nose is sweet with belgian yeasts, fairly peppery, and some faint lemon and green apple. Has that character to it that tickles the back of my throat when sniffing around..  988 characters	4.23
4103	Saison Bernice	Appearance - pours super clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head great retention. Few spotty sheets of lacing.. Aroma - Lemon, light floral, yeast, light cracker, light spiciness very delicate nose.. Taste - Taste follows nose closely lots of lemon and citrus peel. Yeast, light floral flavors not quite as spicy as the nose pet on..  466 characters	4.78
4104	Saison Bernice	Straw and slightly hazy with a few small, slow rising bubbles and 4 fingers of white head.. Smells of brett and funk, oranges, lemons and Belgian yeasts, some fresh plastic like a German Heffe.. Light and subtly sour with lemons, orange rind and Brett, barrel funk, and nail polish..  510 characters	4.39
4105	Saison Bernice	Tasted from bottle. Classic farmhouse saison. Pours a hazy gold. Fruity and funky aroma. Crisp, light, refreshing mouthfeel. Flavors of citrus fruit, farmhouse funk and some grassy earthy flavors. Excellent.	4.44
4106	Saison Bernice	As a New Englander who has been to Vermont several times...I can't help but make the comparison (which I feel is apt) to Hill Farmstead's lovely array of farmhouse ales.. Simultaneously simple yet complex - Bernice comes through across all four sensory components with high marks. She pours slightly cloudy, yellow liquid that sits beneath a cap of white foam. Light, but lively, effervescence brings the beer to life.. Aroma is citrus, hay and light funk. Balanced harmony with each playing to the others' strengths. Restrained but remarkable. Taste is citrus - apricot, lemon and grapes - followed by a tart and funky kiss. Fruity and earthy yeast-notes throughout..  738 characters	4.39
4107	Saison Bernice	Poured a bright hazy yellow color with a fragile foamy white head that disappeared quickly. There were extravagant aromas of Brett, white grapes, subtle citrus, with yeasty overtones. Very fruity and aromatic. The flavors are likewise the same, very fruity with yeasty overtones. Plenty of white grapes around the mouth with some Brett and subtle citrus and perhaps pitted fruit. The flavors come without any restraint. Its like opening up this bottle released its potency. The mouthfeel was not harsh, it was quit pleasant, smooth, and light bodied. Overall exceptional beer, the flavors where spot on, again extravagant without being overwhelming. I could drink this again and again if I only I had easy access to this beer.	4.43
4108	Saison Bernice	"Holy crap is this rated high, I had no idea. Well its time then. Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/2"" white head. This review is from a sample on tap at the Bistro barrel aged festival. Dry yeast brett nose to it. Light. When you talk rustic agricultural stuff, here it is, plenty of leather meets wood meets hay meets various barnyard effects here. This is what its all about. Layers of aromas.. The taste is pretty nice, you get about a 6 on the 1-10 sour scale, soft acidity, still plenty of those hay, leather, cotton, humidity and barnyard notes. Its like a blend of a saison, but the sourness of a wild ale. Light amount of pepper in the mouth feel, along with all that other stuff. Carbonation is more than average.. I really enjoyed the beer, but wow, I think if you put an InBev label on this, it wouldn't even move the needle for beer nerds. Instead, low yield small batches from a slightly out of the way brewery = ratings gold (on BA). I totally dug it, but it didn't even stand out that day amongst all the other beers."	4
4109	Saison Bernice	Sadly, I neglected to note the batch number - I shared this bottle with friends and bar staff at Barrel Theory in St. Paul. The bottle gushed every so slightly, but showed no signs of being infected. The nose is lightly sour, while the taste is light, mildly sour, yeasty, clean, and very drinkable. It's a beautiful gold-yellow in color with a light, crisp head. I wish I'd drank this by myself - it's a delicious beer!	4.48
4110	Saison Bernice	Pours a clouded golden yellow with a medium sized sized, spongy head.. Smells of leathery basement, mushrooms, sweet candy and a touch of vinegar. Offers a rustic, crushed grain quality with a note of white bread dough. Has a flowery note atop, making this pleasantly complex.. A bright, sparkly effervescence defines the beer’s mouthfeel, finishing with a long lasting bitterness..  1,210 characters	3.83
4111	Saison Bernice	I received this from @bum4ever in an LIF box. Poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip glass. It pours a cloudy, golden-honey color with nearly a finger of foamy, eggshell-colored head and creamy lacing with long retention. The tiny bubbles ascend continuously. It's a lovely pour. It has a fragrant, sour aroma with lemon peel, banana, coriander, clove, and funky yeast. It's absolutely delicious with the sour fruit complimented by a touch of sweet banana and apple as the glass warms. The balance of sour, sweet, and spice is terrific and there is a touch of pepper at the finish. The mouth feel is wonderful: despite the lively carbonation it's remarkably creamy and viscous. Overall, this may be the best Saison I've had the pleasure to drink. The flavors are bold and the feel is as good as it gets. What a privilege to drink this wonderful beer!	4.53
4112	Saison Bernice	Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head and carbination. Fruity aroma. Taste is a dry tart with fruity accent that is not too harsh. A pleasant saison.	4.25
4113	Saison Bernice	750mL bottle from j47paco (thanks again!). No discernible bottling information. Served in an oversized Bruery snifter.. Pours a hazy toasted lemon with a billowing two and a half fingers of fluffy white foam. The head settles to a modest layer that, along with a hearty crown, leaves a few traces of lacing.. Bright yeast character on the nose with notes of citrus zest, sour apple, hay and sugar cane..  942 characters	4.34
4114	Saison Bernice	Bottle poured into fluted snifter.. Slightly hazed yellow straw. Thin foamy head quickly dissipates into thin ring of bubbles around my glass.. Aroma is crisp citrus, yeast, slight sweet tartness. Hint of grassy field..  448 characters	4.52
4115	Saison Bernice	Poured out a golden-yellow color with some haze and a small white head. It smelled of lemon, acidity and white wine-like notes. Some sweet caramel, tart and acidic lemon flavors. Crisp and sharp.	4.5
4116	Saison Bernice	Amazing saison! Beer pours a hazy lemon ade with a nice fluffy 2 finger head.aromas of lemon, tropical fruit,funk.flavors of lemon, slight tropical flavors, more tart lemon finishing with a dry funkyness.	4.53
4117	Saison Bernice	"Hazy pastel yellow with a dense layer of foam, delicate drippy lacing in the glass.
Aroma has some gentle acidity and white wine traces.
Taste is moderately tart with some balanced oaky notes of white wine barrel.
Dry finish with a slight tannic aftertaste. Balanced and drinkable.
Thanks Dan for sharing!"	4.25
4118	Saison Bernice	A: Moderate fruitiness, with a smooth citrus, lemony aroma, slight spice, and light tartness.. A: Golden color, slightly hazy, with a thinnish white head that quickly recreates a thin film across the glass.. T: Lemony fruitiness, very clean, with a light spice note and moderately low tartness..  467 characters	4.59
4119	Saison Bernice	Had this at the brewery in Capitola. Just a nearly perfect saison with complex sour spices running through every mouthful. Definitely a perfect introduction to the offerings of Sante Adairius.	4.46
4120	Saison Bernice	Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstraw capped by a massive head; nice and sticky, with a drapery pattern of lacing. Smell: Funky yeast, white pepper, rustic grass, lemon rind, pear and a hint of peach. Taste: Funk forward and then the tart tones build, with grass, lemon rind, white wine grape and pear underneath; slightly bready, through the middle, with citrus pith and rind flavors exploding; very dry finish.  693 characters	4.75
4121	Saison Bernice	Poured from the bottle into a tulip. A very enjoyable saison - good carbonation resulting in a near creamy mouthfeel, nice brett funkiness. Not overly complex, but well done overall.	4.28
4122	Saison Bernice	One of the saison's I've had. Great spice and fruit coming through on this. Little bit of funk smell on this. Golden hue on this little bit of carbonation. Nicely done.	4.55
4123	Saison Bernice	"A: Yellowish/Orange....very clear and a small white head that dissipates quick.
S: Apples, white grape, wheat, funk....smells amazing.
T: Same as the nose...apples, tart white grape a little funk. Beautiful
F: Crisp, dry and refreshing; moderate carbonation
O: This is an outstanding saison. Very well done. Just a beautifully delicate beer."	4.43
4124	Saison Bernice	A flat out fantastic saison by SARA. Excellent fruit and spice flavors are balanced with a wee bit 'o funk to send your taste buds to pleasure town. Two thumbs up!	5
4125	Saison Bernice	The palatal sensation is quite remarkable. White peppers, thyme, jasmine, himalayan rock salt, cloves, oak, and lots and lots of bretty funky goodness. Some tart peach pith notes surface toward the back as the brew warms up as well, which is quite baffling as no fruit was purportedly harme... I mean used, in brewing this beer. Whatever it is, I could smell this over and over again.. This is an adjective I hesitate to use in describing beer, but the white pepper from the nose expresses itself in quite a pungent manner on the tongue. It's not at all unpleasant -- it hits the tongue with a brief but vigorous impression and slowly fades away toward the back of the throat. It's almost as if a pair of hands with very long nails leaped out of the glass and pinched your tongue for not wearing green on St. Paddy's Day and now you're just kind of flabbergasted wondering what happened.. Labored imagery aside, the pungent pepper is accompanied by some acetic citrus, a mild tart and yeasty body typical of a well-brewed saison, with a pleasant oak backdrop. There's a sharp acidic pinch from time to time that seems to pair off with the aforementioned pungency, but the astringency is nowhere close to being unpleasant, and mellows out pretty quickly..  1,534 characters	4.84
4126	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	I’ve had a majority of the highest rated/reviewed Prairie Stouts. Probably all of them in the top 250. This is easily the best one of the bunch. Everything is superb!	4.65
4127	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"A spectacular stout; as the previous reviewers explain the taste follows the nose - apples, malty, boozy.
You MUST let this warm to experience the full flavor profile."	4.45
4128	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Pours a Pitch black no head or lacing. 4 oz pour. Apple brandy aroma. Very mild roasting. More roasting on taste. Heavy on the brandy. Apple on the end. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.	4.03
4129	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12.. My only problem, however, was evident right off the open and pour. I opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off, but I didn’t hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer, because the one I had had little to no carbonation. It has a nice dark hue with some brown edging, but there was no foam and very little lacing. If they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date, this was bottled 9/26/18. Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here. But if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation, I’d take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there. Because this is phenomenal! Long time want, glad I got it.	4.76
4130	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Opaque dark brown with a thin tan head.
Aroma: chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and subtle apple brandy. Really nice.
Taste: followed the nose. Great balance between the stout flavors, barrel, and apple brandy. Delicious.
Feel: full bodied but not overly sweet.
Overall: world class. Lived up to expectations."	4.47
4131	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	12 oz, bottle purchased in OK. Poured into Kane chalice and allowed to warm.. L: Small light tan head. Leaves no lacing but does have a persistent cap and ring. Beer is dark black.. S: Apples, brandy barrel, roasted malts, chocolate, floral and citrus hoppiness.  818 characters	4.4
4132	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a jet black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy, tan-colored head that quickly dissipated. Average lacing.. S: A very enticing aroma of apples, wood, chocolate, roasted malt, hops, and toffee.. T: Tasted of a mild amount of hops (mostly in the finish), a lot of chocolate (a big component), a bit of toffee (it hangs around the edges), some roasted malt (present throughout), and a lot of the apple brandy (and its barrel). A complex, slightly subtle, well done flavor. It's not as aggressive as Prairie's other stouts, but it's definitely tasty stuff..  755 characters	4.49
4133	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a fairly dark black body. Lovely deep brown head that dissipates quite quickly
S — Apple brandy, molasses, hot booziness, dark chocolate, hint of roast, caramel
T — Dark chocolate, brandy, oak, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, roast, faint char
F — Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Quite easy drinking for the ABV, the apple character from the brandy really helps here
O — Nice offering from Prairie. Still like Bomb more but this is very good. Very pricey @ $14/12 oz bottle. 85/100"	4.24
4134	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Black pour at 55 degrees with no ruby edges; quick cap of fizzy bubbles. Aroma of apple cider; brandy liqueur retro nasal. Apple jack, red wine, semi sweet malt base; some chocolate; green apples finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation; very light warmth despite 12% ABV. World class, so we’ll balanced and so dangerous; brandy/barrel notes are off-set by gobs of ripe apples from nose to sip through the finish; impressive!	4.71
4135	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Disappointed. The apple brandy didn't work for me with this dark base stout. It was also pretty thin in mouthfeel especially for this brand. I much prefer Bomb!, Pirate Bomb!, or Birthday Bomb! to this one.	3.68
4136	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Pours dark black with a small beige head that fades quickly. The aroma has apple brandy, dark chocolate, cocoa, and dark roasted malt. Tastes like it smells. Sweet taste. Not much of th dark roasted malt comes through, so there is no balancing bitterness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. A very drinkable beer. I love the Apple Brandy barrel. It is a nice change of pace.	4.43
4137	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"In my teku it is a very dark brown with a half-inch, quickly dissipating, tan head.
Aroma of booze, sweet fruit, and chocolate.
Apple brandy taste, with some chocolate.
Very smooth. The brandy is quite noticeable, but complimented by the chocolate. I would drink this at room temperature, or near it, to fully appreciated the beer."	4.41
4138	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Prairie Apple Brandy Barrel Noir, 12% ABV. Pours black with the typical Prairie ring of brown bubbles. Nose is apple brandy, taste follows and as it reaches 55 degrees F the chocolate shows up. Excellent mouthfeel, though a touch watery, still overall outstanding. I'd advise just drinking this at room temperature.	4.27
4139	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	For goodness sake, let this warm up to near room temperature. Otherwise, it's a dull, muted brandy barrelled beer. Around 60-65 degrees F, it emerges into a chocolate fondue apple of a stout, still of only modest complexity, but definitely bolder and more appealing.	4.31
4140	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	I had the original by the tulsa boys. I thought and still think it’s the best beer I ever had. This new one is a let down. First smell was that apple juice dominated over everything else. That was odd and off putting compared to the original. First taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original. Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though. It’s just not as rich and balanced as the original, plain and simple. Considering this is my favorite beer ever. Please try again. I will applaud the extra effort.	3.12
4141	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"This is my first AB beer and man I'm enjoying it!
Pours black as can be with a thin khaki head.
Smell is amazing! Green apple, barrel, dark fruit, caramel.
Taste is quite nice too! The green apple leads the way, charred oak, raisin, caramel, dark roasted malts. A bit sweet on the finish.
Nice slick almost syrupy feel. Very smooth, low alcohol presence.
Overall a fantastic beer that I was thankful to have tried."	4.56
4142	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	A: sweet and light boozy with green apple, cocoa nibs, plum, dark red fruits, licorice. A: opaque black with little head, light carbonation.. F: apple cider, roasted malts, caramel, fog, prune, rasin, toffee.  415 characters	4.23
4143	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Drank Oct 3rd 2018. Purchased in OKC at a local store.. Dark, dark appearance with approx 1/2 inch of thick head. Very thick feel, like a thin syrup almost. Taste is out of this world. One of the best I’ve tried, easily. Overall, very very good brew. Prairie, you’re doing it right! That said, this amazing brew ain’t cheap. One of the more expensive 12 ox bottles I’ve picked up. But I tell you, it’s worth it to at least try it once. I’m gonna go buy a couple more bottles despite the price. It’s worth it.	4.85
4144	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"Vintage: 2015
Poured from bottle into tulip, good 1 finger dark tan head, good retention and lacing. Jet black in the glass, no light gets thru. Smells of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, roasted malt and slight hint of apple, not much. Taste is deep roasted malt, and chocolate, very rich. There is vanilla, caramel, and some apple coming thru in the middle. The end has a slight mouth numbing alcohol finish, not hot, just warming. Mouthfeel is wonderful, great beer, great sipping beer. I want to kick myself for not grabbing more of this when I had a chance. I think I still have a 2016 in my cellar. Looking forward to it.
One thing to note, as the beer warms (started it at 48) that numbing alcohol finish turns into a lingering taste of apple brandy. Man this beer is special"	4.53
4145	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"2016. Raisins, chocolate, and booze. Tastes like a you simmered red apples in brandy.. 
EDIT: bought 8 2018 ABN and they were all infected. Be careful with 2018."	4.5
4146	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"Taste: Apple, caramel, raisi
Feel: full body, thick feel. This beer actually blew my mind. Loved the taste. It's a real winter warmer.. Sadly shared it and only had half a bottle ;-p"	4.75
4147	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	A 12 fl. oz. bottle with a Julian bottled on date of 13316, meaning that it was bottled on 12th May 2016. Poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Black in colour with a very thin tanned head that dissipated quickly and left pretty much no lacing.. Aroma: Apple brandy, caramel, chocolate, vanilla and a light whiff of alcohol..  732 characters	4.16
4148	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	"Reviewed on 7/3/16. 2016 bottle. L - Pours thick and brown. No head
S - I get candied apples. Oak. Brandy. A touch of molasses.
T - Flavors are chocolate, maple syrup, apples, and brandy. A little sweet and a little boozy.
F - Very mouthy with some heat on the finish.
O - Very complex and good."	4.39
4149	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	great great beer. Nose was amazing, sweet smelling of apple brandy. Nice dark pour. Taste is very great. Sweet, not too boozy, apple brandy and stout. Very viscous feel in the mouth.	4.99
4150	Apple Brandy Barrel Noir	Tasted from bottle. Pours Black with almost no head. Aroma is brandy, caramel, cocoa, dark fruits. Thick chewy mouthfeel with a slight alcohol burn on the finish. Flavors of cocoa, toffee, caramel, vanilla, brandy, apple. Awesome sipping beer.	4.62
4151	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 vintage - drank on 7/14/2019. Unbelievable how much a barrel does to this beer. It's tremendously thick and the coffee is warm, lightly roasty, and sweet. Incredible beer.	4.74
4152	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of black cholate, bourbon wood and some tobacco notes is very interesting. Taste is a great mix of black chocolate notes with some light residual sugar notes, some bourbon and woody notes with light vanilla and some dominant tobacco notes. Body is full with oily texture and good carbonation. Quite the extreme imperial stout with tobacco playing a bigger role then I was expected.	4.25
4153	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Enjoyed at GAB bottle share, 2013. Light fizzy head, thick black beer good legs. Nose sweet syrupy thick beer, little roasty cocoa, mild coffee and barrel.  379 characters	4.1
4154	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	absolutely beautiful beer ... dark pour with a frothy mocha head that hangs around for a while and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. aromas are bourbon soaked chocolate, molasses, and roasty malt. opens up on palate with a huge blast of vanilla and delicate caramel character, sweet milky chocolate, toffee, candied wheat, mellow earthy coffee roast, molasses, and dark roasted malt. there is an assertive and slightly spicy bourbon flavor but its so well integrated into the rest of this robust and complex beer that it manages to be simultaneously bold and restrained. mouthfeel is medium+ and oh sooo lush ... not quite sludgy but just perfect for this brew. overall im blown away, this might be the best BA stout ive tasted.	4.88
4155	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	500ml bottle, 2017 release, poured into a Hill Farmstead 6oz tasting glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin finger of khaki head but no retention nor lace. The aroma is nice, smooth bourbon barrel, dark bittersweet chocolate, light coffee roast, a bit of green pepper detracts from the aroma a bit but there is a lingering smokiness as well. The flavors are good, lots of bitter dark chocolate, light coffee roast, rich bourbon and dark grains but as it warms, an unpleasant onion and green pepper flavor appears and is amplified by the smokiness of the beer. The mouthfeel is very good, super full bodied, coating and creamy with a rich and velvety texture and a smooth finish.. Verdict: A decent barrel aged coffee stout from Hill Farmstead. The green pepper sensation is certainly unwelcome, but there are enough other elements to the flavor profile that it doesn't completely ruin things.	3.72
4156	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Hands down the best stout I've ever had. Might be a bit biased because I had it while at HF and in a perfect scenery but the mouthfeel is unbelievable. As silky as can be, plus the nose just bursts with coffee notes. Glad I was able to get this vintage bottle on site.	5
4157	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	In the glass, GoM is a shiny black orb with a thin mocha blanket that settles to thin film in short order. A swirl stains the glass with oily brown legs that descend slowly.. On the nose, the oak and bourbon are combining flawlessly with the roasted malt to bring that rare and coveted marshmallow effect, while also providing notes of nutty, roasty coffee flowing into chocolatey mocha, as well as oak that's a touch waxy with a slight heat.. Taste features oak and bourbon with a spicy, dry and woody herbal redwood that brings a little heat but is also waxy and round with nuts, bitter roasted coffee, melted dark chocolate-esque malt, and a hint of vanilla. I just can’t get over the woodiness--this beer absolutely excels here, and finishes with a touch of mature dates..  1,043 characters	4.49
4158	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I'm not a BBA guy but this beer. Mother of god this beer is fantastic. Perfect amount of bourbon. The mouth feel is up there with Triple Shot as a chewy, thick stout. The only knock on this beer is the fact that I can't get more of it. A++ and a must trade for.	4.85
4159	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Had on site at HF 8/18/2017.. Decadent and smooth with just a hint of barrel (wish there was a little more). Extremely rich mouthfeel. So glad I was finally able to try this one. Definitely worth seeking out.	4.47
4160	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Appearance: poured jet black with very little head. The surface looked slick and oily. Noted sediment dispersed.. Smell: a lot to pick up from! Hazelnut coffee and some black licorice candy. Also tons of vanilla and then bourbon at the finish.. Taste: Cloyingly sweet throughout. There is ton of vanilla, burnt sugar, black licorice, and dark chocolate. Also a mocha coffee with a sharp whiskey finish. Mild maple at the aftertaste. All the flavors are blended well into a masterpiece..  744 characters	4.47
4161	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Ho-ly cow! Had this on site today, splitting the bottle with a few friends. Un-be-levable. So thick, so rich. You would never guess the high ABV. Coffee. Could drink forever.	4.5
4162	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Fresh batch released on May 2017. Bottle splitted 4 ways. Black as night liquid with a foamy dark beige head. Nose is coffee, some notes of acidity (cherries or simply coming from the coffee?), chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, lovely! I can’t stop smelling the beer. Astonishing taste of well dosed coffee, residual sugar, milk chocolate, vanilla and bourbon, everything is so balanced, the glass clearly doesn’t last long, I would grab another bottle and drink it all! Abv% is hardly perceptible, medium to full body. One of the most amazing imperial stout I had the chance to drink!	4.74
4163	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottled December 2016. Released a few months ago AFAIKT.. A: Pours black with a smattering of espresso-like tan head and dots of lacing. A fine ring persists for most of the glass.. S: Rich, very dark roast coffee, light roast, and dark chocolate bar meld effortlessly with toasted oak, vanilla bean, sweetish bourbon, and a soupçon of cola. Slight spirit-y note..  966 characters	4.65
4164	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2017 vintage drank on 7/8/17. really great ba beer from HF as expected. Their ba stouts have a unique creaminess to it that really impresses me. Something among the likes of being a milk stout combined with an oatmeal stout to some extent. Whatever it is, I enjoy it. The coffee is not too strong here, but it's presence is felt. The barrel are heavily noticeable and absolutely delicious with the sweet dark chocolate.	4.5
4165	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This one pours a dark-ish black color, with a small head, and a small amount of lacing.. This smells like sweet fruity coffee, with some milk chocolate, bourbon, slight toasted oak, etc.. This is absolutely delicious. It's so creamily delicious, with vanilla, raisins, chocolatey coffee, caramel, sweet bourbon. The coffee is obviously a star here, but it's also just so delightfully chocolate-forward as well..  606 characters	4.77
4166	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	BIG thanks to my new friend Vermonthiker for generously trading this one to me! This was one of the better BA stouts I've had in some time. Really fantastic beer. Happy to share this with my best friend and brother. Unfortunately, the Blackhawks sucked in Game 1 and didn't make this experience complete with a win as we hoped. This was our first Hill Farmstead offering and it did not disappoint!. Bottle date 6/2013. Pours as a stout should, black as night and no signs of light getting anywhere near this ferocious beast. A beautiful espresso colored head forms and disperses into a solid ring and lacing that stays until the last drop. NOSE BOMB! Wow, still a ton of bourbon in the nose with this much time. Was really taken back by the aroma on this. Tons of deliciousness; bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla,oak and malt. Flavor matches the nose with more tongue coating mouthfeel than I was expecting. Lots of sugary sweetness on the finish. Overall, this is a beauty. Really impressed with this beer and how well it sat. Vermonthiker...you're awesome! Trade with this man!	4.71
4167	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured from a 22oz bottle into a taster. Thanks Brandon for sharing this.. Sweet coffee, vanilla, cocoa, caramel roasty , a little plastic on the aroma. Lighter body than expected.	4.45
4168	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Loved this. Poured very dark...almost pitch black. Smell has some sweetness and coffee notes. Flavor is a wonderful medley of coffee followed by subtle sweetness (from the barrel?). Feel is excellent, good carb. Overall, another magnificent beer by HF.	4.65
4169	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Pours pitch black with a nice two finger brown head. With very little lacing. Aroma is booze. Taste is is sweet marshmallow, huge maple syrup,and booze.
Mouth feel is very light for a bourbon stout and super sweet. Had a hot booze finish. I'm a huge bourbon stout fan and this sadly falls off. Big fan of hill IPAs."	4.24
4170	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I really quite enjoyed this beer. First open, pour khaki colored head, lovely bourbon notes and subtle coffee. Taste for me was oak, spice from the barrel, bourbon and roastiness of the stout, not a whole lot of coffee though. I found it to be very balanced and well made, one I will always seek out.	4.91
4171	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Had this next to Genealogy (On tap in Lincoln, Nebraska). Look - Jet black, little bit of khaki head.. Smell - Chocolate, dark fruit, a hint of the barrel. Really nice..  490 characters	5
4172	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Overall this was very underwhelming. Jan 2016 bottling. Pretty weak in a lineup of modern big barrel aged stouts. Much tamer in character. Raisins, nuts and mild bourbon dominate the flavor, not sweet at all. Medium body. Very minimal coffee flavor	4
4173	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Lots of bourbon notes on this. Nice black color. Very thick and has a nice smoky taste. Not much of a coffee note for me or vanilla taste. Very smooth taste.	4.74
4174	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	One of the better hf stouts. Black in color. No head.. Lots of bourbon and oak. Silky chocolate with some char. Roasted malts. Belgian yeast notes. Burnt rubber in finish.. Medium to full bodied. Fairly smooth. Ends roasted.	4.16
4175	Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Split this with a buddy at room temp this weekend. Very tasty notes of chocolate and slight vanilla and some oak barrel. Boozy but smooth....very impressed with this one!	4.85
4176	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	L-Hazy, cloudy......1 inch head........color is like an autumn leaf.......not brown not yellow but somewhere in between......not very attractive. S-Aroma is faint......some tropical hops.........mostly mango. T-Great tasting........flavors are bright.......orange, lemon, mango, tangerine, passionfruit.......lots of fruit juice.  488 characters	4.26
4177	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	16oz can poured into a tulip. A- pours a slightly hazy orange color with a one-finger foamy white head that reduces to a ring around the edge. S- herbaceous and loaded with tropical fruits on the nose; mango, guava, pineapple, passionfruit, cantaloupe and grapefruit zest. Undertones of milk sugars and vanilla.  917 characters	4.62
4178	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Pours a medium yellow color, hazy. Amazing hop aroma - lots of tropical fruits: pineapple, guava, citrus. Wallop of dankness. Very flavorful, I get lots of pineapple, dank guava, light pone, lemon zest. Carbonation is appropriate, kind of thick feel. Overall an outstanding DIPA.. 9/12/19
16 oz can, no date, prob 6 weeks old - Thanks Dave
4.25 rating"	4.31
4179	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Poured into a snifter. An opaque acorn yellow color with a medium sized soapy head. Blueberries, papaya, and tangerines on the nose. The taste was typical Mosaic (to me) with all the above flavors. Slightly sweet and the malt was restrained. The beer had some heft from the lactose, but not at milkshake level. Creamy, smooth feel. Outstanding.	4.24
4180	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Cloudy vibrant orange with a finger of yellowed head. Thick rings of lacing.. Clementines, light white pepper, vanilla and herbs in the nose.. Lighter tasting than expected. Watered orange citrus and dull, piney, somewhat-chalky bitterness show the most when cold. As it warms, there’s a hint more vanilla and herb..  489 characters	3.77
4181	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Pours a murky yellow color with a medium sized head, receeding to a small ring of lacing.. Smells of a profound, herb accompanied lime quality, freshly dried kush and blueberries. This is quite remarkable on the nose, bringing up a kiwi fruitiness, as well as dried green apple and pomelo, all helping to enhance the profound lime impression.. Has a fuller body, exhibiting a creamy mouthfeel with a lower, well fitting carbonation..  962 characters	4.57
4182	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Pours a hazy golden orange with two fingers of tightly formed white head. The head fell faster than I expected.
Smells of orange, tangerine, some vanilla.
Taste follows, orange and tangerine, the sweetness isn't too over the top but just enough to give it an orange creamsicle taste.
Medium to full body, creamy texture, good carb levels.
Overall a wonderful beer, well balanced, hops and sweet cream combine nicely."	4.61
4183	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Hazy yellow with a soft film and thick collar.. This is a milkshake IPA in disguise. Vanilla and Orange Julius flavors come through a creamy body that has a soft but tingly carbonation expanding softly on the palate. This is accented by green eucalyptus and wild weeds before the semi-dry finish brings out some smoothing oats, brightening Smarties and kiwi.	4.43
4184	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Poured from can /OH Roc release 4/19.
Brief but beautiful plump fluffy head. Dissipated quickly but excellent lacing. Nose is quiet but noticeable rich orange/tangerine with some bubblegum. Taste is rich. Orange creamsicle with Mosaic on Mosaic. Rounded with mild Tangerine peel bitterness as beer finished. Lactose evident... milk/cream-sweetness. Feel is SO Smooooth. Easy sip/swallow with reasonable brightness in otherwise soft carbonation. Just about perfect for a DIPA... to my preference anyway.
Noticed when this sold out fast... so heightened expectations.
Oat / lactose contributions more in my wheelhouse, and swung this as more enjoyable than another fav... TH Julius.
Now I know why. Just a great IPA."	4.55
4185	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Captain Lawrence custom tasting pint glass; canned on 4/16/19.
A: Pours a cloudy orange-yellow color, with a no more than one finger, white head, limited retention, and nice complex rings of Brussels lacing.
S: Aromas of tangerine, tutti-fruity, grapefruit, and caramel predominate with a very light pine and oregano notes.
T: Surprisingly dry, certainly at least semidry in my estimation. Flavor is cracker with fruitiness more in the lemon, lime, white grapefruit end of citrus, some very real and pronounced graininess (which adds), a vegetable piece (celery, oregano, daring I say cilantro) and a cumin-like bitterness that is really, really interesting.
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy, juicy, and luscious.
O: Fascinating that an Other Half ""oat cream"" NEIPA really isn't that sweet. Not a criticism -- more an encouragement, keeping experimenting!"	4.56
4186	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Recently canned, and it feels even better than the one I had in the brewery on tap a couple of weeks ago. And it was the same batch. For some reason, I think individual cans are generally better than keg.
Quite hazy orange and peach juice aspect with a thick head with medium retention and leaving laces.
Fresh tropical aroma to die for with notes of mango, tons of stone fruit, passion fruit, pine, fresh squeeze oranges, natural grapefruit and melon.
Flavor with notes of mango, pine resin, melon, white pepper, oat, faint but perceivable milk powder, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, tangerine, onions, biscuit, lychees and guava. Dry aftertaste with a stronger bitterness that apparently feels. It made me sneeze after my first sip. Alcohol of 8.5% is very well disguised.
Medium velvety body with perfect carbonation.
Delicious DIPA with beyond expected tropical notes and green dank resins. Great complexity and wide range of flavors matched perfectly. At some point, I had to stop to further look for flavors. This has sat for 2 weeks and it sure better than the one I had from the same batch on tap in the brewery. I am start to think that we should drink the style fresh, but not that fresh."	4.46
4187	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	DDH Double Mosaic Daydream has been on my wishlist for some time now - I was quite happy to try it when a fellow BA reached out to set up a trade. The cans were quite fresh - less than two weeks old - and the beer is tasting fantastic. Poured in to a teku, the color is a lovely golden orange with a thick white head. Carb is light and the mouth feel is very pleasant - just a bit creamy, quite rich, and the finish is decently clean. It's quite definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum, and once it warms up, and trace of bitterness virtually disappears.. It's not a particularly balanced beer as far as hops go - it's definitely a very sweet IPA - but it's damn fine for what it is. That milk sugar is certainly present in the creaminess and sweetness! I wouldn't want to sit on these beers - I can't imagine they will age well.	4.63

Can to wine glass.. Biggest difference from Dream to Daydream is less citrus, more grassy..  265 characters"	4.25
4189	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Pours a turbid orange creamsicle like with a thick white head on heavy pour. Nose is of a fresh cut fruit bouquet. Citrus and tropical fruits mingle in harmony with stone fruit ;) The taste of this thing is amazing! Papaya, mango, melon, peaches, guava, grapefruit and lemon. Did I miss any fruit? Almost has a orange creamsicle like quality to it minus the lactos or vanilla of course. Light breads malts balance this one out superbly. Medium to full body with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and smooth finish.	4.6
4190	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Pours a murky orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, juicy hop notes, hitting orange, tangerine, papaya, mango, and pineapple. Biscuit and pale malts give it a little base, but overall the aroma is hops, hops, and hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, mango, pineapple, and tangerine. Big tropical fruit notes with solid pale and bread malts. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, lightly grainy texture that really makes this beer drink big. Overall, a heavy experience from this double dry hopped IPA. Tropical fruit notes are heavy and abundant, and yet well refined.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.	4.59
4191	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Fun to try another DDH offering from these guys; dig how the oat - per usual - imparts that superb mouthfeel on an already smooth, creamy, and flavorful beverage. A touch of grassy bitterness in back, too.	4.49
4192	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"On tap at the brewery, Brooklyn.
Usual OH colour; berry with slight ice cream; gentle tangelo, tangerine, onion, cantaloupe, creamy hints, and a honeydew end; creamy and smooth.. 4 4.25 4.25 4.25 4.25. Lactose dulls it. Easier to drink, but less character for it. Take all the shimmer out of regular Double Dream."	4.24
4193	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	16 oz can dated 8/8, about 2 weeks old. Hops: Mosaic. It's a great beer. Probably could do without lactose. But whatever. Has a weird stickiness on the back end..  284 characters	4.25
4194	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Not as amazed as I’d hoped I’d be. The mosaic character in this is less noticeable than one might imagine for the DDH Etc. As always the OH mouthfeel being awesome but wanted some more punchy mango and pine in there	4.42
4195	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	Overall, just a great mosaic hopped beer. Loads of overripe mango and papaya from both the nose and taste. A touch of sweetness makes me think I’m drinking an alcoholic oranges/mango juice. These dream beers are super smooth and a joy to drink, although this one feels a tad thinner than the others I’ve had.	4.64
4196	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	L - dense 2-finger head atop an opaque orange body.. S - heavy grapefruit, papaya, dragonfruit, mango. The nose on this is heaven.. T - bitter grapefruit leads. Tropical sweetness mixed with pine. Moderate booziness..  314 characters	4.47
4197	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Naturally another beer fruit smoothie in that NEIPA style from Other Half, this one featuring Mosaic hops and lupulin powder, oats, and lactose - they call it an ""imperial oat cream IPA"" - Pale gold and totally opaque, looks like some kind of organic orange juice but with a frothy head... Lots of tropical and citrus notes on the nose are followed by creamy orange creamsicle pop meets marmalade meets a pineapple-mango smoothie... Soft and smooth, medium-light feel, plush-feeling goodness... No surprises here... 4/24/18 canning..."	4.5
4198	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	On tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY.. This one pours with a very hazy and murky yellow color, with a small white head and lots of lacing.. All of the beers in the Mosaic Dream series have such punchy and inviting aromas to them- there's orange, blueberry cream, grapefruit zest, pine, weed, and mango..  767 characters	4.72
4199	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	"Canned 4 days ago.. L -- Pours a hazy deep orange with a finger of white head produced with aerated pour. Minimal retention and some lacing
S -- Much less dank than DDH Double Mosaic Dream. Getting lots of candied citrus zest, orange flesh, pineapple, lime. Hints of fusels and woodsiness
T -- Zesty grapefruit orange & lemon, semi-sweet lactose creaminess, piney earthen bitterness, touch of perfumey floral. Reminds me a lot of Trillium/Lawson's Pow Pow. Less of a yeasty bite than DDH Double Mosaic Dream
F -- Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. The oats really soften the mouthfeel and the lactose contributes a sweet, creamy character.
O -- Having both DMDream and DMDaydream in short succession, I'm reminded again of the shortcomings I perceive in lupulin powder, which is used in DMDream and results in more aggressive bitterness and bite. This one is softer, more drinkable, yet retains the same mosaic complexity. 88/100"	4.36
4200	Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream	This beer pours a completely opaque, super cloudy deep golden orange color with a two finger, creamy, soapy white head. Retention is excellent and there are lots of sudsy chunks of lacing left on the glass.. Smell is phenomenal. Candied orange, melon, grapefruit, lemon-lime, pineapple, mango and creamy oats.. Taste is the same. It is immensely flavorful with just wave after wave of mosaic hops crushing the palate. The finish is moderately bitter..  772 characters	4.99
4201	Ground State	2016 vintage; drank 4/21/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Black appearance.. Minimal dark tan head; minimal lace..  423 characters	4.34
4202	Ground State	2o16 vintage. Pours one shade shy of black with an opaque clarity and dresses with a swirl of foam. Nose reveals big coffee notes, ethanol and dark chocolate. Taste expresses sweet cocoa and vanilla with some notes of the barrel in the background. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even, mild carbonation. Overall, a very nice stout. All the flavors coalesced nightly; however, it comes off a little thin.	4.21
4203	Ground State	2018 draft from the tap room. I've had a lot of great coffee beers and it's one of my favorite adjuncts, but this was almost straight coffee for me with little barrel, enough to the point that I did not feel it was worth drinking this over coffee. Just my opinion, but I know a lot of others feel differently - just check the rating and previous reviews. Love Bottle Logic, but just wasn't feeling this beer.	3.8
4204	Ground State	2018 edition courtesy of Lingenbrau. Pour is black, somewhat viscous, moderate tan head.. Smells like bourbon soaked cocoa nibs with oak and vanilla. A touch boozy. Some maple syrup/caramized sugars and burnt coffee grounds in the background..  916 characters	4.59
4205	Ground State	Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2017 edition.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light wisps.. S - Aromas of heavy maple syrup, cocoa, bourbon barrel. No discernable alcohol..  630 characters	4.15
4206	Ground State	"Thanks to rudzud, 2017
Pours a light fizzy dark head, fares fairly quickly, little lacing, nice long legs. Nose very rich, maple candy, candy caramel maple, little dark choc cocoa, little forestry and mild char, but syrupy roasty char cloying sweet, creamy lactose milk chocolate. Taste sweet candy and big maple, toasted grainy malt dark malt, little coffee roast, mild toasted vanilla barrel, mild bourbon whiskey, some dark chocolate cocoa, little bitter malt and hop, sticky sweet finish.  588 characters"	4.25

550ml bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep black color with a one-finger foamy khaki colored head that reduces to a ring. S- herbal espresso up front, mixes with notes of mocha cream and dark chocolate, along with roast & char. Undertones of anise, caramel, brownie batter & a hint of vanilla.  744 characters"	4.34
4208	Ground State	2018 bottle. Teku pour. Preface that I generally prefer BA stouts without coffee.. L - Fizzy, translucent black with thick bubbly head. Looks very highly carb'd.. S - Tastey aroma but hardly differentiated from a founders breakfast stout. There is a little more sweetness which I'm getting maple from (but is that the power of suggestion?). Wasnt blown away by CBS but to memory I liked its aroma more. Note that I'm also getting cinnamon as it warms..  1,621 characters	4.23
4209	Ground State	This was a gifted bottle from a BIF buddy - and one that I was very, very excited about. I shared this with friends at a local brewery, thus my pour was small, but the beer is undeniably impressive - the nose is full of maple and coffee notes. The beer tastes of light coffee roast, just a bit acidic from the coffee, with plenty of pleasant maple syrup and cacao. It is baffling to me that this is so much harder to get than Fundamental Observation - but as good as it is, it perhaps should not surprise. Who wants to trade away such a fantastic beer?	4.71
4210	Ground State	This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing.. This smells incredible- just a big chocolatey espresso bomb, with light earthy maple syrup, high quality dark chocolate, toasted oak, heavy dark roast, cookie dough, bourbon, and brown guar.. This is absolutely excellent, and one of the best uses of coffee I've ever had in a beer. The coffee is so fresh and vibrant, with a perfect roast level, some cookie dough and brown sugar flavors, and lots of chocolate. The beer is just so fudgy and smooth. The barrel is light, more oaky than actual bourbon. The maple is definitely a subtle touch- it is very far from a true maple bomb..  871 characters	4.8
4211	Ground State	First beer from Bottle Logic. Pours a thick viscous deep brown/blackish color. Nice mocha head that fades after a minute or so. Glass lacing is there, as it should for a high ABV stout. Smell is sweet bourbon and dark roast coffee. Some vanilla, too, but definitely a bourbon presence. Taste is very bourbon forward, especially before it warms. It’s to the point even after it warms it’s a somewhat hot from the bourbon. I’m not getting much maple, but am getting lots of dark roast coffee. Also dark chocolate, so that aspect of the beer definitely shows. Some more faint vanilla and even a little dark fruit. Got a hint of caramel sweetness, too. Feel is right there with other bourbon beers. Overall, it’s good but I think it needs a year to mature. If I’m not getting much maple now, I don’t expect more to come forward. I’d rather see where this goes after some time in the cellar.	4.27
4212	Ground State	2018 vintage. Bottle poured into snifter.. Pours black with a half inch medium brown head.. Nose: vanilla and coffee dominate. Bourbon barrel and maple come in towards the end. Bourbon is pretty subtle..  564 characters	4.64
4213	Ground State	Batch 3 (2018), poured into an Alesmith snifter. Pours a medium dark espresso. Nose is mostly maple, coffee, and oak, with some butterscotch and caramel. Palate is chocolate fudge, maple, coffee, with oak and butterscotch notes. Disappointingly, the chocolate and maple dominates the barrel character, so it’s not as complex as one might hope. Still a good brew, but it's not in the upper tier of the category.	4.25
4214	Ground State	2018 release.. A: Pours black with a half finger of cola-like dark brown head. Average retention and almost no lacing.. S: Strong coffee, light cocoa and vanilla bean, and mild rounded bourbon..  731 characters	4.45
4215	Ground State	"On tap at Brewery
Looks good! Think, with dark tan head
Coffee prominent on nose. Not much of other adjuncts
Palate similar. Good but maple is overpowered. Tasty for sure, just wanted more balanced and subtle flavor"	4.14
4216	Ground State	Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Yellow Session. Lots of cacao, ice cream and dark malts on the aroma. Taste has sweet cacao, fudge, caramel, bourbon and toffee. Well balanced, smooth coffee finish with medium bitterness.	4.75
4217	Ground State	Let my 2017 sit out for 9 months in my closet. It was insane, fudgey, chocolatey, nice mouth feel and great coffee that did become muted over time (I prefer that). One of my favorites.	5
4218	Ground State	MAPLE! Bourbon, maple, chocolate and vanilla goodness. For how high the ABV is, it did not taste boozy in the slightest. It certainly packs a punch but its pretty sneaky about it. Big fan of BL (when I can get it) and this did not disappoint at all!	4.81
4219	Ground State	Pours a big black syrupy light blocking brew that looks like blackstrap molasses with a thin cappuccino cap. Head only on aggressive pour settles fast into thin tan collar.. Aroma burst forth with boozy bourbon barrel, bittersweet cocoa, and sweet maple. Hint of vanilla pushes through as it warms.. Flavor is full of maple, smooth bourbon, flash of sweet vanilla followed by bitter baking cocoa. Booze isn’t hot, but you can tell it comes in pretty high on the ABV scale..  668 characters	4.54
4220	Ground State	2016 vintage, poured into a tulip. Nice roasted coffee (still), coupled with some detectable vanilla creaminess/sweetness. Nice mouthfeel, highly impressed.	4.49
4221	Ground State	Very darknappearance with minimal head. Aroma is a bourbon and coffee blend that has perfect balance. Taste is a slightly sweet molasses bourbon and coffee blend that is exceptional	4.67
4222	Ground State	"2016 tulip glass served at cellar
Look: pitch black, half inch khaki head
Smell: big bourbon with hints of maple and coffee and lot of chocolate
Taste: bourbon, maple, vanilla, coffee and a ton of chocolate
Feel: medium to thib body and carbonation
Overall: a traditional breakfast stout, could have used more coffee and body"	4.51
4223	Ground State	Hot black with a slim brown edge and a thin tan film.. Smell is Hot cola, roasty malt, bourbon, and chocolate, bringing flavors of light maple, Hot bourbon, slick, thick chocolate and barrel notes. The hype is too Hot! ...and this was batch 1!	3.49
4224	Ground State	Poured out of a 500ml bottle into a Duvel tulip. It pours as a thick inky liquid that has a little trouble raising a dark brown head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves no head. The smell of this beer is stunning. The coffee and vanilla smacks you in the nose first with the malt, bourbon and a hint of maple filling out the experience. The taste is sweet with maple and vanilla merging with chocolate, coffee and bourbon. There is a bit of booze in the flavor but it seems in balance with the rest of the flavors. This is an amazing breakfast stout.	4.66
4225	Ground State	Wow do I love maple stouts, this one definitely doesn't dissapoint. It's very coffee forward with just enough maple to sweeten the finish. I really enjoyed this beer, I'll be seeking it out again.	4.77
4226	Impermanence	Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass canned on 10/23/19. Pours a very attractive near pitch black with a massive 3 finger head that leaves massive waves of lace as it slowly settles, truly gorgeous. 5. Smell is maple, cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla beans, and some coconut. 4.5. Taste follows maple is most dominant with vanilla, cocoa, coffee, and coconut in the back end really something special. 4.5.  627 characters	4.56
4227	Impermanence	Bottle at share. WOW! Silky black pour, ring of brown head. Mellow aroma of chocolate and coffee. Taste brings some brown sugar sweetness, coffee, chocolate, perfectly blended, smooth. Light warmth.	4.63
4228	Impermanence	"500ml bottle, undated, poured into a Half Acre ""occult"" tulip glass. Enjoyed on 07.07.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick, inky and oily with a khaki head that has little height and retention with great lacing. The aroma is nice, lots of maple, rich and decadent chocolate, nice coffee roast, dark grains, brownie batter and a touch of vanilla cream. The flavors are in line with the nose, crazy adjunct forward, rich and sweet maple, brownie batter chocolate, dark rich grains, a nice light coffee profile bridges the sweet with some roast and acidity while vanilla and caramel ensure this finishes with more sweetness. The mouthfeel is great, thick, creamy, heavy body that coats well and finishes easily.. Verdict: A nice adjunct forward milk stout from Tree House. Rich, decadent, creamy, it's got just about everything for a pastry stout but perhaps loses sight of the traditional characteristics of a milk stout."	4.34
4229	Impermanence	No bottling date, which I imagine they do intentionally to keep people from storing this long term, as it states clearly on the bottle, “drink it fresh—do not cellar!” But, I picked this up at the brewery on June 13, 2019, so I’m not taking their advice! Still a knockout Stout. Massively sweet malt in the nose and some unique coffee aromas. The incredible malt bill and maple syrup really stand out in the flavor. You get the coffee and dark chocolate throughout in the background. A bit boozy and certainly on the sweet side with a properly heavy body/feel. Wish I saved this for eggs & bacon on a weekend morning!	4.58
4230	Impermanence	Pours dark black. Aroma is an awesome sweet smelling mix of chocolate, maple syrup & coffee. Tastes like the smell but add a charred/roasted flavor. Feel is sticky but a bit thinner than I expected. Overall an incredible stout.	4.73
4231	Impermanence	this is absurdly good, my favorite, i think hands down, of the three dark tree house rarities that my legendary brother procured and saved to share with me. i am a sucker for maple syrup, but the maple isnt what sets this apart, the quality and complexity of the base beer is. additives aside, this is a stunning and unique stout, propped up and accented just right by the lactose, which is so rarely the case, and with cool layering of the malts, roasty sure, but with deep cocoa and java and mocha notes in the grain too, which i think is why the cocoa and coffee that are added work so well. its not one flavor climax, its a series of increasingly powerful flavor climaxes through the whole drink. i get the coffee well ahead of the chocolate, and agree with the melted coffee ice cream descriptor they use, some bitterness absolutely, but a deep espresso crema richness as well, very multidimensional, and its with the grain, not above or against it. the chocolate aspect is a dark chocolate, and its there through the whole drink, rich as well, but also that organic dark high cacao bar chocolate with all the complexity and earthiness. the maple is exquisite in here, peaks in and out at different times, adds some velvety textural smoothness, and a continues mellow sweetness, as well as the essence of the maple tree itself, the flavor of the syrup comes through so well, its stunning really. a bigger feel but from the grain not the sweetness or the booze, which i love, and a long chocolate and maple linger. brilliant liquid, famous for a reason, and a treat to share with my brother around the campfire. maybe my favorite tree house beer i have ever had, and a beer of the year candidate for me this year for sure!	4.71
4232	Impermanence	500ml bottle purchased at the brewery on 7/6/2019 and served in a Spiegelau tulip at 50 degrees. Pours two shades shy of black with a fizzy, half-inch, mocha-colored head the sizzles and slowly disperses towards the edges. Decadent nose - huge notes of maple syrup, followed by coffee and chocolate. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a charred quality that cuts the backbone and keeps the brew from being cloying. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a kiss of oiliness to the texture and a mild, even carbonation. Overall, quite delicious and drinkable.	4.27
4233	Impermanence	"Serving: Bottle
No date (Consumed Jul-10-2019). 
Pours like used motor oil with a ruby-brown, rocky finger-and-a-half of head that drops to a healthy film leaving stringy lacing in its wake. Both the aroma and flavor are seamlessly in sync. Big, thick, dark and candy bar-like. The whole thing is about as chocolatified, roasticized and caramelicious as you can get. There is a smooth mocha body to both and the slightest hint at bigger stout flavors (roasty/molassesy), the lactose is there but more as a structure for the rest, I feel like this was one of the least milk sugary of the beers like this I've had. It is like drinking velvet, heavy and moderately carbonated, lingering multi-faceted finish. Wow.. This is a classic example of an excellently executed beer. Big but light on its feet, decadent but drinkable, sweet but not, bitter but not, multi-layered but very coherent, boozy but you'd never know it, gimmicky but still beer, etc. This is one of the few beers where after finishing it and finally taking a look at the marketing babble on the bottle I feel like they pretty much encapsulate it perfectly. Lots of brown sugar, molasses, chocolate and roast in aroma and flavor. It all comes through (like most of their beers do) in near perfect harmony. One thing I really like about this one (I am not the biggest ""pastry stout"" fan) is that as diabetes-inducing as it tastes, it has some really nice stout character and drinks more like a beer than a dessert. In a lot of ways this beer reminds me of an old-school imperial stout with the edges smoothed off by the lactose and random sweet adjuncts. At least that is how I feel at this particular time with this particular bottle.... Very well done, TH people!.  1,768 characters"	4.54
4234	Impermanence	A- Motor oil black pour from the 500ml bottle to a small becher glass. The head is a deep cocoa tan hue and it shoots up to an inch with decent retention. A medium ring left at the edges leaves spotty lacing.. S- A large base of roast barley and chocolate with touches of maple and espresso. Dark, bitter and sweet suggestions and the balance is really quite nice between the base beer and the adjuncts.. T- What was suggested in the aroma of maple becomes a tsunami wave of maple on the taste buds. Initially it starts as the classic woodsy maple flavor before cascading into the maple sugar candies you would find at a good maple sugar producer. It pushes the limit and borders on too much without breaking the levy. Balance is provided by bright dark chocolate, espresso beans, medium-high sweetness and hints of toffee, cocoa powder and toasted nuts..  1,216 characters	4.43
4235	Impermanence	Pouring thick black ribbons, it builds a tall, dense mocha head that slowly settles to a creamy blanket leaving camouflage lacing.. That maple! It's not upfront at first, favoring that classic, lightly nutty, lightly airy cocoa-like Tree House roast, but the maple quickly asserts itself, becoming more smoky and rich here than other TH stouts that feature the addition. Notes of bruleed brown sugar emerge as it evolves on the palate.. The full fluffy body has a semi-dry, semi-sticky finish. It's not overly sweet at all, but the sweetness it does have brings a bit of a vanilla character to it. I think a little more coffee earth, char and bitterness would have been the only thing that could improve this for me.	4.23
4236	Impermanence	Bottle: this one pours an inky, opaque dark brown color. There was a little bit of a dark tan head that dropped away quickly and left no lacing. Good nose. Mainly dark, bitter chocolate. Some roastiness and a hint of coffee. Maybe some maple. The taste is very good. Bitter dark chocolate, maple, faint coffee. A bit of lactose too. A creamy texture. A really excellent beer!	4.68
4237	Impermanence	TREE HOUSE IMPERMANENCE COFFEE MILK STOUT 6/19/19. Poured from the 16.9 oz. bottle into a Samuel Smith English tulip.. a; Opaque black with an inch and a half tan head which receded very slowly to thick surface foam and very dense lacing..  725 characters	4.65
4238	Impermanence	16oz. capped bottle into Night Shift stemware.. This beer belongs on a magazine cover! Great mocha colored head with a dense, pitch black color. Huge lace and great head retention. Nose is mocha, chocolate, fudge, espresso and lightly roasted malt. Some brownie and a lactose creaminess in the back. Robust and flavorful but not overly complex. Beer opens maple syrup, coca cola, espresso, iced coffee and chocolate. More syrup and fudge in the middle with a touch of vanilla sweetness and a light coarse, roasted malt. End more chocolate and coke. Sweet, sticky, fudgey aftertaste. Body is full with low carbonation. Rich and velvety on the palate and goes down dense, slick and oily. Lingering, sticky aftertaste that lasts for days. A hint of booziness but not so much to disrupt the experience.. Really really good overall. Probably my favorite in the series.	4.5
4239	Impermanence	This is what I dream of when the words “breakfast stout” are raised. The look is pretty but the pour is low head, and there’s not much lacing, either. That said, the nose offers a chocolate milk and maple one two. The flavor, of anything, is more decadent, the sweetness rounding with dark chocolate tartness, coffee acidity and a general brightness I’ve never seen. This is a truly exceptional beer, and not one to miss.	4.8
4240	Impermanence	A: Poured into a Palm tulip, it's black and viscous and slow-to-pour from the bottle. Small milk-chocolate brown head on top.. S: Chocolate, chocolate malt, molasses and roasted barley malt.. T: Chocolatey - fudge-like, in fact, with lactose, some hints of coffee and a touch of maple on the roof of the mouth in the aftertaste. Heat from the ABV noted in the aftertaste, and clearly felt in the belly..  478 characters	4.43
4241	Impermanence	Poured into a teku glass via bottle. color is a velvety mocha brown. smell is chocolate and maple with some faint dark fruit (Raisin).  342 characters	4.36
4242	Impermanence	"Mid sized bottle, direct from the source about two weeks ago and lovingly stored in the fridge since then..
Bottle tells me ""Keep this beer cold and drink fresh - do not cellar"" ""Drink this beer now - It will never be better"". Dark stout like pour, dark mocha cap. Milk chocolate and cafe au lait on the sniff.  566 characters"	4.44
4243	Impermanence	500ml undated bottle.. Pours opaque black with a short-lived head of brown. Minimal retention or lacing. Rich notes of dark roast coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup. Full bodied with a creamy, velvety mouthfeel. Fudge batter with maple syrup and espresso on the palate. Finishes sweet with lingering chocolate and maple syrup.. Truly decadent and rich.	4.49
4244	Impermanence	Many beers taste interesting at the first sip. But when that first special sip flavor carries through to the end of the glass, you know you have a winner. This stout is blended and balanced so well--coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, caramel all play off each other--a perfect symphony!	4.95
4245	Impermanence	The best TH stout that they make on a semi-regular basis. TH made famous for their IPAs but they make the most fantastic dark beers in the world, and this is their best! Super smooth but with a ton of complex flavors.	5
4246	Impermanence	Pours opaque, jet black in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is black coffee, cream, and sweet maple. Heavy bodied, sweet, with moderate backbone. Complex, loads of maple flavor, especially at the end. Great stout. One of the better maple coffee stouts I have had. Delicious.	4.72
4247	Impermanence	From a 500ml bottle... is there a date on here? I can’t find one. Served in a tulip.. Appearance is totally opaque with a scant finger of soft and bubbly mocha-colored foam. Retention is just so-so good but leaves a thick creamy collar and a solid curtain of lacing right up the sides of the glass.. Aroma is mildly sweet and creamy, fudgy..  1,419 characters	4.39
4248	Impermanence	Probably one of my top choices in stouts from treehouse. Looks perfect in the glass; pitch black with a thick, milk chocolate head. Great lacing. Smell is maple and chocolate, some coffee there too. Taste blew me away, excellent balance of chocolate and maple, a true desert. Every time it is offered, I make sure to make the drive and grab my allotment. I prefer this over moment of clarity.	4.4
4249	Impermanence	Pours a very deep black color with a thin brown head on top. Nice chocolate notes on the nose along with some dark roast. The taste has a good balance of dark chocolate and some subtle sweetness. The feel is silky smooth. Overall it’s a very good stout.	4.36
4250	Impermanence	Impermanence pours a thick and viscous dark brown with a small, tight and frothy head that dissipates quickly leaving a khaki tan ring around the glass. The smell is wonderfully smooth lactose sweetness with fresh vanilla beans and roasted coffee. A hint of coconut, maple syrup and smoked wood. Taste.Wow! It's amazingly smooth on the palette with the roasted malts coming forward, as the coffee bitterness is very mild. A nice sweetness throughout with the maple and sweet chocolate coming through.	4.65
4251	Stickee Monkee	"Look: Dark, not too thick.
Smell: Strong bourbon barrel.
Taste: Multiple flavors including bourbon, toffee, vanilla, almost even a slight coffee flavor.
Feel: Strong flavor, light consistency, and lasting aftertaste.
Overall: Absolutely love this beer."	5
4252	Stickee Monkee	Served in a tulip glass from a vintage 2017 bottle.. Appearance: very dark amber coming off with an off white head.. Smell: heavy whiskey feel which disintegrates into your nostrils and stick with you for a while..  590 characters	4.69
4253	Stickee Monkee	Pours out dark brown. Some light penetration. Not completely opaque. Half a finger of head that fades quickly.. Smell is huge and delicate at the same time. Bourbon, brown sugar, banana, bready malt, cinnamon, raisin, toffee, a tiny whiff of the soy sauce character that appears when you mix strong malt and barrel aging. Some savory nuttiness on the fade out. These all mix so well, without a strong presence of booze.. Taste is everything that the nose is. Drinking this I could guess why they called it Stickee Monkee. It's like a Sticky Pecan Bun and Monkey Bread all at the same time. The cinnamon, brown sugar, and nuttiness matched with the sweet glazed flavor of banana and raisin packed baked bread. All balanced on a razor's edge..  1,271 characters	4.46
4254	Stickee Monkee	From tap to tulip, brown-black pour with a cream head that fades fast. Aroma and taste of toffee, raisin, molasses, maybe licorice or anise, malt, caramel. Alcohol is conspicuous, isn't masked by the other flavors in the same way as other beers in this style. Low carbonation, almost a root-beer texture. Overall really nice beer to end my weekend, I was very happy to find this on tap locally.	4.5

4257	Stickee Monkee	Very dark brown, headless but does have a ring around the edge. Nice aroma: molasses, alcohol, charred oak, vanilla & caramel. Plenty of sweetness here. Flavor: add brown sugar to the barrel flavors, caramel & a little grain with just a hint of bitter at the finish. Feel is silky smooth, medium thick with some alcohol burn. Delicious!	4.43
4258	Stickee Monkee	"This bottle label claims ""11.4% ALC./VOL."" and ""12 FL. OZ. (355ML)"" with a date of ""2018"" and ""No. 005"". Appearance: The body is black and it sports a very short head which is creamy textured. The head has minimal retention and it fades out to a ring with large bubbles around the edge. No lacing..

Medium full mouthfeel - sweet but not cloying - creamy and deliciously smooth - fantastic."	4.44

4262	Stickee Monkee	This is the 2018 vintage, for clarification. I expected this one to be significantly different from Sucaba and Parabola, but it is almost as similar to those two as they are to one another. It's also quite delicious. The price point is a bit heavy though.. L The pour reveals a dark cola-brown body, transparent when held to a light source, revealing sparse little globs of sediment floating about. A thing layer of oatmeal cookie colored head disperses quickly, leaving no lacing at all.. S: Like the others, the aroma carries several barleywine notes, particularly of dried dark fruits, molasses, chocolate syrup, vanilla, licorice, leather, booze, coconut, charred oak and tobacco. Centered on the fruity notes, the overall impression is reminiscent of a sweet dark berry jam, like a medley of black currant, lingonberry, and plum..  1,507 characters	4.59

4264	Stickee Monkee	L-Pours a dark mahogany, little evidence of carbonation.........small 1/4 inch head that quickly dissipates.......mild lacing with little retention. S-dark candied sugars, dark fruits such as plums, figs, raisins, some notes of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, barrel, tobacco. T-Burnt candied sugars, bourbon barrel, vanilla, molasses, caramel, very similar to the nose but the flavors are far more pronounce than the aroma's.........tobacco, dark fruits (cherries, raisins, plum).  708 characters	4.36
4265	Stickee Monkee	Dark brown with a ruby tinge, some visible carbonation and a half finger of fast fading beige head.. Smells of cherries, figs, raisin bars, coffee, and phenols.. Tastes of bourbon, cherries, figs and raisins, and creme brulee..  365 characters	4.38
4266	Stickee Monkee	Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a light brown foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of candi sugar is pretty intense with some barrel-aging notes also clearly identifiable. Taste is a mix of deep rich residual candi sugar notes with light candy-like notes, some vanilla and bourbon notes with light dry fruit notes also perceptible. Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable beer but slightly too sweet which limits drinkability after a while.	3.75
4267	Stickee Monkee	"2018 batch - 11.4% ABV
LOOK - Dark dark color with a reddish hue. 1 finger head out of a 12 oz. bottle. Some lacing continues on and only a foam ring remains after the initial head recession.
SMELL - Rich plum and caramel malt. Slight smokiness/charred oak. Some bread and yeast.
TASTE - Very powerful blast of dark fruit and caramel. Some chocolate, tobacco, and coffee. Belgian yeast and some spice. Very flavorful.
FEEL - Full bodied. Thick and creamy. Slight oiliness.
OVERALL - This is a very good beer. This barrel aged quad is very flavorful and rich. I didn't let this one age. This one would even improve with a couple more years."	4.58

4271	Stickee Monkee	"I have enjoyed their small beers, so now I'm going through some of the more specialty and bigger beers.
Aroma is wood and bourbon and vanilla with only hints of the quad. Pours with small head for style. Brown to black, except in light can see the garnet quit well.
This shines more in the taste. Rich and complex. This being a fresh version (2018) it has a new crisp almost sharp bite. Some dark rich fruit and berries starts to show. Still strong on the vanilla, but some really tasty shots of berries....oh, so nice. Dry enough with the wood lingering and maybe even a little hop character sticking to the tongue.
Man, that berry is so nice. With the vanilla it has a strawberries and cream quality.
Feel is good but nothing exceptional. Moderate with enough carbonation. In time there is a silky smoothness that appears in the feel, leading to a greater appreciation of this aspect.
This is about the flavors they derived. Worth it, indeed."	4.37
4272	Stickee Monkee	Deep brown molasses colored brew. A true sipping beer, with a wave of tastes depending on the length of time in oak barrels. I drank this 2017 vintage in late 2018, tasting oak, coconut and molasses. Delicious!	4.5
4273	Stickee Monkee	Medium head. Pours brown and lush. Tastes like molasses sassafras and by gum it sorghum. Nah for reals though it's a wine-barrel-aged type treat. ALBEIT more of a barleywine than quad. Yum	4.63
4274	Stickee Monkee	"2018 Vintage
""Stickee Monkee is meticulously brewed with Belgian candi sugar in the classic Quadrupel manner, then aged for more than a year in retired bourbon barrels to create a stylistic outlier that we call a ""Central Coast Quad"". The result is a beer that offers profound molasses flavors with notes of toasted oak, coconut, leather and cigar tobacco."". 12oz bottle poured into glass.
Dark brown colored body with brilliant garnet edges when back lit. Does not produce much of a head, but a thin ring is fed by rising bubbles, and there is a artistic partial island left in the middle of the glass. No lacing.
The alcohol arises in the aroma. Rich malt with molasses emphasis. Has a whiff of coconut and leather.
Taste is rich with molasses malts and candi sugar, along with the oak bourbon barrel. Quite intense with additional flavors of coconut and leather. As suggested the tobacco is there too.
Mouth feel is heavy and creamy. Felt carbonation is low.
This is a candi sugar, molasses alcohol bomb. Great density and intensity. A tremendous sipping beer."	4.44
4275	Stickee Monkee	OMG!!! This beer, super tasty and the smell...it’s what I imagine Willy Wonkas secret river would taste like. And the mouth...holy hell how the flavor sticks to your tongue= mind blown. If you have a chance, DO NOT HESITATE. Cheers!	4.47
4276	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	2018 vintage - drank on 7/13/2019. Definitely bourbon to the taste; plenty of anise, very complex. Thanks to jhavs!. 2019 vintage - drank on 7/13/2019. Counterintuitively, this is smoother and has more pronounced chocolate. I prefer it to 2019. Awesome. Thank you to jhavs again!	4.75
4277	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.. This one smells like roasted malt, caramel, coffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla, smoke, leather, maple, and dark chocolate fudge.. This is just about as good as it gets for non-""adjuncted"" barrel-aged stouts. There's a ton going on here - it's primarily deep and fudgy. There's also caramel and maple sweetness, a bit of smoky bitterness, heavy roast, barrel vanilla, oak, toffee-heavy bourbon, and a little bit of coffee. This is hard to beat..  847 characters"	4.74
4278	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	2019 bottle. Minimal foam head upon aggressive pour, with color being deep deep dark brown, with caramel color foam that disappears quickly. Aroma is of rich bourbon barrel sweetness, which also is beautifully present in the flavor. The barrel presence and sweetness shines without coming across too boozy. Still somehow very smooth and balanced. The mouthfeel is perfect, especially as it warms, and thicker than 2018 Damon . This beer should be served and consumed around 10-12 degrees C.. Hill Farmstead does it again.	4.68
4279	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Stark black with a fuzzy mocha head settling to a persistent creamy blanket leaving minuscule tan spots on the glass.. Like many of Hill's non-adjunct barrel aged stouts, this is absurdly woody with a smoky hickory character. At the same time, it's easy drinking, as the smooth fluid light body delivers sweet chocolate and accents of ground walnut before finishing semi-dry. As it warms, creamy vanilla and some waxy oak develop before the warming bourbon exhale.	4.09
4280	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"Bottled 3-28-18. L-The beer pours glossy and black allowing no light penetration even at the edges. The head is a modest 3/4 finger high and mocha in color. The head recedes to a thin film with thicker central island. Lacing is minimal but can be raised by swirling.
S-The nose is dark chocolate with bourbon riding over the top of it.
T-The nose translates to palate exactly. There is a fantastic dark chocolate base which transitions mid palate to a pleasant medium strength bourbon presence. The two elements mix in the finish with the chocolate from the malts lasting slightly longer into the aftertaste.
F- Mouthfeel overall is on the higher side of medium. Carbonation is light. This is one of the thicker barrel aged stouts that I've had. It has a slick, silky feel on the tongue which coats and allows the flavors to linger.
O- A beautifully crafted sipper of a beer. None of the flavors are new or innovative, just crafted in a way which demands your appreciation. Honestly I can't recommend it highly enough."	4.45
4281	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Great beer. However, I still felt somewhat disappointed considering its hype and trade value. GoM and Beyond Good & Evil were better offerings in my opinion.	4.38
4282	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	A: served draft at the brewery into a long stem tulip glass, intensely dark with a massive tan head that lingered leaving great lacing, clear, side note: this beer was from a separate tap served warmer than others. S: supreme sweetness and bourbon, molasses, toffee, roasty malt. T: like a marshmallow chocolate milkshake with a hit of coffee and a generous pour of high quality bourbon, a hop snuck in there at the end to remind me this is a beer.  665 characters	5
4283	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Bottle. Poured inky black. Minimal head. I (as I believe most) love and have loved this label for years. Finally got around to trying it. Honestly I thought it was lacking in barrel character. The other flavors and aromas were tasty but I think it needed more barrel. Still good. I actually believe I had the Port version a few years ago and remember liking that one more than this.	4.03
4284	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Luxurious, oaken, bourbon-y, smooth, warm, silky, sweet and slightly bitter. What a gem of a barrel aged beer.. All components march in lockstep, which the silkiness and balance of the beer being the two standout characteristics. Dark malts, bitter chocolate, oak, earth, fudge, licorice and a hint of leather. Complex, dark, deep, robust - all of these apply. Alcohol warmth without giving off any heat.. Thick but not viscus, substantial but not heavy - it's a sipper that won't occupy your palate for en entire evening.	4.41
4285	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Aromas of caramel, toffee and chocolate. The taste of milk chocolate with a hint of roast hits your tongue and lingers to the finish. The mouthfeel is fluffy. Overall terrific unpastried BA stout.	4.71
4286	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	A black, beautiful beer with a tan head. Dark fruit, bourbon, char and vanilla are the dominant smell. Just the most wonderful stout you could want, big barrel character with the dark fruits and vanilla to round it out. If I could knock it a little, it would be mouthfeel. It could be a touch chewier, but overall this is a delicious beer. Cheers!	4.85
4287	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"Revisited 101/12/19
A-Pours a very dark hue with a nice chocolate brown head and lacing
A-Aroma has roasted malts, dark chocolate and generous bourbon hints
T-The taste follows the nose with roasted malts, dark chocolate and a generous bourbon flavors
M-A medium bodied moderately carbonated beer with the flavors opening up as the beer warms
O-A very nicely balanced Russian Imperial Stout"	4.75
4288	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	500ml bottled on March 28, 2018. This beer pours pitch black with a lasting dense creamy tan brown foam head. Smells like beautiful black cherry, dark chocolate, charred oak, some meaty smoke, smooth rich bourbon, caramel, vanilla, dark brown sugar, some toasty roasted malts, with mild hops to balance. Taste is off the charts with huge robust dark chocolate notes, beautiful black cherry, some meaty smoke, charred oak, smooth rich and sweet bourbon, caramel, vanilla, dark brown sugar, toasty roasted malts, with mild earthy herbal floral grassy pine. Feels super luxurious and smooth, rich and sticky, thick and viscous, medium plus bodied with low carbonation. Overall a really great and truly amazing bourbon barrel aged imperial stout that I thought would be hard to live up to it's hype and the wait in line, but it’s worth it.	5
4289	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"Poured a 2013 vintage into the test glass
A - Deep dark delight on full display.and aggressive pour yielded an off white cap, thin french lacing clings to the glass
S - Sweet dark vanilla, toffee, coffee, white oak, cedar, a bit of alcohol in the nose
T - Wow, complex, toasted malts, dark cocoa, mashed with vanilla bean, cinnamon, tobacco, anise, and a hint of smoke
M - Thick in body, palate is fully coated with a slick feel. alcohol cleans that up, just enough to keep things moving, linger is sweet and dark
O - What a treat, so well constructed, the bourbon barrel adds to an intense stout.
World class on all levels"	4.42
4290	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"Bottle date of August 2013.
Cracked on a nice warm October night.
Look: Pitch black like the bottles namesake pooch.
Smell: Sweet melted caramel toffee, charred oak. Smells a little hot for 10.5 points.
Taste: A huge hit of bourbon, the base stout is in there somewhere but I can't quite place it. Fairly sweet and boozy overall.
Feel: Thin to medium mouthfeel.
Overall: This bottle being four years old maybe past it's prime unfortunately. I can almost imagine the stout being more robust in taste and thicker in mouthfeel. Now that the stout is starting to fall apart the barrel treatment is overpowering and is out of balance."	4.03
4291	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"I don't normally start by stating the overall impression of the beer, but Damon is quite possibly my platonic ideal of a barrel-aged stout.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is definitely a labored metaphor, but remember the first time you tried Everett and realized all other porters are child's play compared to Shaun Hill's magnum opus ""Robust Porter""? If there were a genre of beer called ""Robust Barrel-aged Imperial Stout"" Damon would definitely fall right into that categorization. Every little complex nuance that captivates fans of dark viscous liquids aged in wooden containers is amplified beyond the wildest of imaginations, while at the same time striking a perfectly harmonious symbiosis.. An impossible concoction of charred oak, french vanilla, chocolate fudge, medium-roast coffee, raisins, tobacco, molasses, and jammy figs form the heavenly aromatic range associated with this tributary beer. As the brew warms up, the malt-based features of chocolate and coffee take precedence over the more bourbon-inspired olfactory attributes of the pitch-dark nectar of the gods.. I quite possibly use this phrase to the point of cliché, but the nose, as expected, is flawlessly replicated on the palate. Every sip of this obsidian magical concoction screams ""bourbon! coffee! chocolate!"" followed by quiet whispers of ""molasses, dark fruits, light vanilla."" The flavors that bombard the tongue throughout the drinking experience remain remarkably consistent; I drank this over a span of twenty minutes sandwiched in-between pours of a different BA stout from OH and a half-barleywine half-stout half-whatthefuck madness from WA, but the flavors remained steady and uninfluenced by the imposing characteristics of both brews upon revisiting. I almost want to call this the Heady Topper of BBA stouts, given its consistency and ungodly balance of flavors throughout the entire drinking experience..  2,399 characters"	4.96
4292	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Flat black with a thin layer of tan foam. No leave. Aroma of oak and vanilla. Smooth creamy body, low carbonation. Flavors of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, roast malt. Nutty and grassy finish. Lingering oak and vanilla when time.	4.41
4293	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Pitch black pour, offwhite head. Amazing aroma, bourbon , dried dark fruit, coffee, roasted malt. Black chocolate giving way to bourbon, coffee, blueberry, dark malt. Fuller body. Amazing.	4.59
4294	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Pours an oily black color with a small, dark brown head, which vanishes immediately.. The aromas of this are simply amazing - there's a lot going on with licorice, scorched malts, tobacco and dark chocolate. The barrel adds a tremendous depth with dried apples, rock sugar, peppers, dried plum and lots of spicy wood, tickling the nose by developing a boozy warmth.. Drinks silk and velvet, full bodied with lots and lots of alcohol soaked layers of rich maltiness..  1,128 characters	4.87
4295	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	I never cease to be amazed by Hill Farmstead beers. Any style that I have by them is one of the better examples of the style that I have had. This beer is so smooth with nice bourbon tones that just add to the enjoyment. Love me some HF!	4.71
4296	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Damon rocks in typical HF fashion. Great looking stout and nice soft two finger mocha head. Nose is primarily coffee, bourbon, and raisins. Taste is bourbon up front and semi-sweet bakers chocolate finish. Velvet smooth mouth feel with a tingle of carbonation on the finish.	4.6
4297	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Amazing beer. One of the best bourbon barrel aged beers I have ever had. So smooth for 10.5 percent. Wish I had more to have. ! A++++++. Cheers Mates!	4.98
4298	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	"Bottle from 2013.
Poured on Christmas morning 2016 into stemmed Hill Farmstead stemware.
Pours nearly jet black with one half finger of deep caramel colored head.
Aromas are incredible, a perfect mix of deeply roasted malt and bourbon.
Flavors are wonderful and balanced. Notes of bitter coffee, sweet chocolate and mellow bourbon.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Silky, thick enough.
Overall, this is completely on par with BCBS if not better."	4.78
4299	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	2016 vintage drank in a snifter on 12/8/2016. Deep dark blown look with some lacing and a nice tan head. The smell of this was heavy oak and milk chocolate. Really enjoyable. I got some similar notes in the taste but some sweetness opened up as well, almost like a dark fruit or cherry flavor along with some caramel. Really nice. Not super thick which is similar to their style, but the complexity of their barrel aged stouts continues to impress me. I love their stuff.	4.58
4300	Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	This was a great barrel aged stout. Very dark. Carbonation was low as others said. Great barrel bite. Has that chocolate bourbon feel. Love the smell. Such a nice thick body.	5
4301	Double Barrel Jesus	I tried this alongside my previous favorite beer - the Evil Twin Aún Más A Jesús. This was clearly better. Unfortunately, I tasted close to 20 other top rated beers that day, and I didn't take any notes for a thorough review. But I know my scoring is accurate, as this and the Aún Más A Jesús were the first two beers I tasted that night. To me, this is the best of the best.	5
4302	Double Barrel Jesus	2016 vintage; drank 2/24/17 @ the Yarchives.. Motor oil black appearance.. Minimal tan head; no lace..  364 characters	3.92
4303	Double Barrel Jesus	"2016 vintage poured from a 22 oz bomber moderately, resulting in a three-quarter inch tan head over a very dark brown body with some lacing. Wonderful nose of chocolate foremost with a bit of booze from the bourbon barrels as well. Taste mirrors nose with a chocolate flavor that won't quit. Not too boozy at all, but the bourbon is definitely there. Very nice mouthfeel, and overall, what a treat. Cheers!
After warming for half an hour or more flavors of caramel, toffee, and bitter chocolate come forward. Wow, so very nice and complex!"	4.59
4304	Double Barrel Jesus	Black color with a ring of brown foam. Aroma has lots of roasted malt, some umami and boozy bourbon. Taste is roasty, savory, chocolatey with some dark fruits on the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Quite nice but not as spectacular as expected.	4.45
4305	Double Barrel Jesus	22oz bottle thanks to Steve. First of the Jesus lineup. Normal inky black pour, small ring of head. Sweet, malty boozy aroma, molasses and wood. Taste is smooth, sweet and malty. Vanilla,brown sugar, bourbon. Syrupy and slick	4.03
4306	Double Barrel Jesus	Tasted from bottle. Pours jet black with dark brown head. Huge chocolate aroma with molasses and some bourbon notes. Sticky thick chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, molasses, toffee, bourbon, vanilla. Bourbon flavor is more subtle that a lot of BA beers. Very well done. Excellent sipper.	4.77
4307	Double Barrel Jesus	2017 vintage drank on 14 May 17, bottled in February i believe. was delicious, cocoa, vanilla, slightly smokey, sweet bourbon, and oak. the base stout is great but this exceeded expectations. i have another one aging, can't wait to try it after the year mark.	4.96
4308	Double Barrel Jesus	"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a thick dark brown to motor oil black color with a finger's worth of tan foamy head that slid off at a mild pace. Some stringy lace concaved at the sides.
The aroma leaned to the sweeter side - thick with pure chocolate fudge, milk chocolate cake, sugar and some whiskey at the end.
The flavor was sweet all of the way through pulling in that ""cake-like"" taste to give off a bigger and fuller aftertaste that somewhat reminded me of whiskey soaked fudge.
The mouthfeel was full bodied with a pure sipping quality about it because the ABV is not only felt but somewhat noticeable in it's ""heat."" Carbonation felt fine. Finish was thick and sweet.
Overall, diabetes in a bottle. A 22 oz. bottle can be tough to take down, but I did over the course of a 4 hour period. Not for the faint of heart, I suggest to share with a buddy."	4.14
4309	Double Barrel Jesus	Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.. Pours an ink black body with very little head and retention.. Aromas are heavy on the whiskey and milk chocolate, very strong and potent Classic BA stout aromas. A little booze..  451 characters	4.49
4310	Double Barrel Jesus	super super sweet, more sweet decadent barrel notes (big vanilla, toffee, caramel, chocolate) come through than actually bourbon character. molasses and some mellow dark fruits and spice note, hint of oak and mellow bourbon. not much boozyness at all for the abv. medium-full mouthfeel, some chewy texture.	4.58
4311	Double Barrel Jesus	2017 bottling (I think), poured into Kane chalice and let warm for an hour. L: Dark black with a light tan head. About 1F, not much retention. Leaves a thin light tan ring.. S: Bourbon and barrel dominate the nose. Dark fruits and chocolate are minor notes. This beer probably needs to be aged. Too bad I could only get one..  820 characters	4.41
4312	Double Barrel Jesus	Amazing! Huge chocolate flavor and a huge mouth feel that melds bourbon and oaky vanilla with the chocolate for a heavenly experience. Mod-palate I also get an interesting tobacco flavor. Complex. I love this one and it falls in with the maybe 5-10 beers I give a perfect rating.	5
4313	Double Barrel Jesus	Shared the 2017 version of this beauty with a couple friends last night and it was great! Had it alongside both the Maple Syrup barrel Evil Twin releases from this year and the Double Barrel Jesus was better than either of them! Nice boozy finish which will calm a bit as it ages I hope (since I have a 2015 DBJ in the cellar) but has a ton of chocolate and bourbon on the nose and palate.	4.9
4314	Double Barrel Jesus	Pours black with small tan head. Slight bourbon notes on the nose. Good thick stout with slight barrel sweetness and very smooth finish. Was expecting a little more given the ratings, but still a good beer overall.	4.27
4315	Double Barrel Jesus	Pours thick and black with a touch of light brown head. Complex nose.....fudge, whisky, leather, raisin, plum, roast, oak, and bourbon. Taste is very balanced.....I think the extra time in the barrels really cuts some of the sweetness that is typical in many evil twin offerings. Feel is thick and velvety with low carbonation. By far my favorite ET stout to date.....	4.6
4316	Double Barrel Jesus	Was cold out of the fridge. Let warm up to ~50 degrees prior to drinking.. L - Portion of a bomber partially poured hard into a snifter. Thick, heavy dark brown with dark khaki head.. S - bourbon, raisens, roast. Smells like barrel aged ten fidy. Very sweet. Very decadent..  881 characters	4.43
4317	Double Barrel Jesus	Poured into a Teku glass. Pours midnight black and as viscous as motor oil. Minuscule dark tan head. Dark fudge and whiskey feature primarily on the nose, with some vanilla, oak, and a touch of caramel also there. Taste follows, in a sense- heavy chocolate fudge with a huge, but not overpowering, amount of whiskey. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, full bodied, with a lower carb appropriate to style. Better than the non-BA Even More Jesus IMO. An huge beer, and a good one.	4.59
4318	Double Barrel Jesus	Poured into a snifter. Viscous and opaque on the pour. Midnight in the glass. Minimal head with wisps of tan foam. Whiskey, vanilla, oak, cocoa, and roasted coffee on the nose. Not boozy-smelling. Tasted like rich fudge dipped in bourbon. The flavors played very well together. The whiskey predominated, and there was a tinge of sour on the finish, but overall it was balanced. Full-bodied but not overly sweet. Better than the non BA version.	4.3
4319	Double Barrel Jesus	Pours black. Nice brown head. Two fingers. Fades slowly with light lacing. Aroma is awesome. Deep dark chocolate, molasses, coffee grinds and brown sugar. Taste is great too. Follows the nose. Deep chocolate fudge, coffee grinds and dark fruits. Another awesome stout from evil twin. Huge fan of their stouts.	4.68
4320	Double Barrel Jesus	22oz bottle. Pours a viscous black color with a half inch of dark brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of Bourbon with fudge, molasses, coffee and earth. The taste is a large amount of woody Bourbon followed by fudge, chocolate syrup, leather, molasses, dark fruits and earth. Leathery, Bourbon finish with some more fudge. Heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Lots of alcohol heat. It's like drinking Bourbon soaked chocolate syrup. Overall, an outstanding BA Imperial Stout absolutely worth seeking out.	4.39
4321	Double Barrel Jesus	Striking the difference between robust, decadent and drinkable lands the double barrel aged version of Evil Twin's imperial stout in no one's land, but also everyone's land.. Double Barrel Jesus pours with an oily layering into the glass. Like syrups, a patient swirl releases a short statured but densely packed froth. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, coffee and sherry all align on the nose with a sultry sweet and savory scent. Rich with malts, the early palate accepts a lush taste of those promised chocolates, cake, caramel, cream and vanilla that sat in anticipation of flavor.. As the stout opens up, its high sweetness only recedes slighlty. Chocolate fudge, espresso, heavy cream, vanilla, molasses and brown sugar register soundly on the middle palate. Moderately bitter, the internal woodsiness of the beer trends oaken, spicy and awaiting a boozy kick of sherry, bourbon and peaten scotch whisky..  1,066 characters	4.7
4322	Double Barrel Jesus	Poured from a bomber into a tulip. The true motor-oil black pour. Thick and black as can be. The nose is pure chocolate fudge - in fact, it smells identical to a chocolate ganache I made last week. The palate and mouthfeel are what really propel this beer to greatness. Chocolate ganache blends perfectly with appropriately subtle barrel aging, and darker fruits start to emerge only as the beer warms. In terms of mouthfeel, this is perhaps the thickest beer I've tasted. It's an incredible tour-de-force of the style, and one that does the chocolate side of Imp Stouts in an appreciably fresh way. Excellent.	4.47
4323	Double Barrel Jesus	This is my personal white whale. I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for years. Even More Jesus is my favorite stout and I've been dying to try the BA version.. This beer pours a thick, darker than midnight, jet black with a late forming, dense, dark brown with a tinge of maroon colored head. It recedes quickly to a sliver of a ring around the edge of the glass, and there are just a few spots of lacing.. Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and sweet dark fruit..  1,163 characters	4.7
4324	Double Barrel Jesus	Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger brown foamy head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating around average time but on the faster side for an imperial stout. It settles into a layer on top and leaves minimal spotty lacing.. Smells of dark chocolate, hot fudge, soy sauce, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, light oaky or charred wood notes, cocoa powder, molasses, dark fruit like raisins and dates, vanilla, piney hops, black coffee, milk chocolate and then booze like a dark rum or smoky bourbon. It's sweet but not cloying or over the top, allowing the bourbon notes and hops to straighten it out for a degree of balance - a beer this big is supposed to be roasted malt and booze dominant and it is, but the fruit and chocolate nuances make it wonderful to inhale.. Tastes simple, rich and maIty yet at the same time very complex with dark chocolate, hot fudge, soy sauce, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, light oaky or charred wood notes, cocoa powder, molasses, pumpernickel bread with raisins, dark fruit including figs, raisins and dates, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, black licorice, espresso, tobacco and some herbal/earthy notes. Fair amount of bitterness which blends well with the general malty and barrel influenced sweetness, char and rich boozy flavors. The bourbon is not dominant like Founders KBS or Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, but it is involved with every aspect of this beer and adds a positive bourbon barrel influence across the board..  2,201 characters	4.84
4325	Double Barrel Jesus	"Wowza. This was fantastic. New batch.
L. Motor oil pour. thicky thick. Black.
S. milk chocolate bourbon brownie. Really good stuff in the nose.
T. Follows the nose. Sweet brownie and milk chocolate. You can tell the bourbon is there, it's so blended well. Not hot at all, smooth.
F. Here it really shines. It's so thick, full mouthfeel.
O. Phenomenal. It was on the sweeter side so if you don't like em sweet maybe not for you. I solo domed it. Splitting it amungst friends prob would have been smarter. One of the best ba stouts I've ever had!"	5
4326	Bad Boy	On-tap at Chupacabra in Mesa, AZ:. Pours golden with a white head. White lacing sticks.. The smell is of huge tropical and citrus notes with some tangerine and pine that is musty in a good way..  494 characters	4.29
4327	Bad Boy	this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence...	4.27
4328	Bad Boy	Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus. On the tongue is delicate but flavorful west coast style zesty hops, piney and citrusy with a light bitterness on the finish. Moderate malt backbone. Smooth and easy, especially for 9%	4.25
4329	Bad Boy	Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant. Taste is citrus up front with mid sip malt and finishes piney. Feel is relatively viscous for a DIPA. I love this! Overall, an excellent west coast DIPA. Very smooth for 9%!	4.47
4330	Bad Boy	"Bottle Date: purchased a month ago
Palate Contaminants: a pizza with some liquid smoke. The look is dark straw, with a nice amount of fine white head. A little opaque, but it does let plenty of light through.. The smell is delicious sweet pears. There's also a little pine sap and some pineapple sharpness. It's not super complex, but what's there is really good..  942 characters"	4.38
4331	Bad Boy	about a 3 week old bottle drank on 6/6/2017. I've been seeking this one out for a while and I can certainly see why this was in a league of its own when it was first released. The piney, dank, citrus combo is really nice, it's incredibly drinkable, and somehow there's very little bitterness while the ABV is quite high. I really enjoyed this one as this showcased the west coast style very nicely.	4.35
4332	Bad Boy	Another great Alpine IPA. These guys do an awesome job. Had this one a few months back and it was super fresh, super dank, great piney taste and hops came off with a perfect bite.	4.65
4333	Bad Boy	One of the most wonderfully aromatic IPAs outside of the northeast! Alpine IPAs never fail to deliver, and this bad boy (ho!) is no exception! The bottle creeped me out a little bit, but I won't hold that against such a delicious DIPA.	4.54
4334	Bad Boy	Probably my favorite beer that I've had from Alpine. Danky pine and citrus goodness, with a good mouthfeel and crisp finish. I now understand what I've been missing, and thankful for them bottling this and for the awesome trader that sent this my way. One step closer to dying happy.	4.71
4335	Bad Boy	"Finally had a chance to try this after looking to get a growler full for years! Small bottle run took place and I got a couple :). Solid offering from Alpine direct instead of the Alpine/Green Flash partnership... :(
Hope they make this a yearly release!!"	4.52
4336	Bad Boy	22oz bottle poured into a snifter.. Appearance - Simi hazy orange hue.. Smell - Dank and citrus..  335 characters	4.52
4337	Bad Boy	I remember this being kinda boozy. Huge tropical fruit and dank hops. Somewhat thick mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Great, but not amazing like people say.	4.31
4338	Bad Boy	Dark ipa almost, dark orange and tan notes create an impressive head that holds its own for a few minutes. Aroma seemed to be somewhere along the lines of citra, summit, amarillo and simcoe.. All the usual Alpine hop flavors, fruit, hides alcohol, pine, mary jane, mango. Extremely crisp and dry finish. Just another excellent big dipa from Alpine, all the usual feels. Not as good as Nelson though.	4.49
4339	Bad Boy	From a growler. Fresh fresh fresh! Hop aromas are pretty floral and fruit-forward. Plenty of biscuity grain detectable. Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater. Grassy on the back end, seems like a hallmark of Alpine. Mouthfeel is smooth with a distinctive tongue tickle. Way too drinkable for how strong it is. Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner.	4.87
4340	Bad Boy	On draft at the Alpine Pub. My first time having Bad Boy and it may be the best beer I've had from Alpine. Incredible aroma and wonderful hop flavor, but without overwhelming bitterness. Incredibly drinkable at 9%.	4.49
4341	Bad Boy	32 oz. growler. Slightly hazy. Small white head. Thin collar. Smell is bright citrus. Boozy. Fruity and a little bit of apple. Taste is bright citrus. Pine. Astringent maltiness. Maris otter is distinct. Boozy. Low carbonation. Medium body. Very tasty, but very big.	4.07
4342	Bad Boy	Look: straw, pretty clear golden yellow. semi thin white head.. Smell: fresh hops and god's vagina. Taste: best part of this beer by a landslide. how is it 9% ? nobody knows. well, at least i dont..  563 characters	5
4343	Bad Boy	Best DIPA ive ever had. it is a hop monster but so drinkable, if it was available consistently it would dethrone Heady topper, which in my opinion is highly overrated.	4.99
4344	Bad Boy	"Type: Draft
Glass: Pint glass
From: Alpine Beer Company in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $6.00
Purchased: Oct. 15, 2014
Consumed: Oct. 15, 2014
Misc.: N/A. Poured a honey, light caramel, semi-clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of offwhite head when I got it. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom at parts of the glass. Very good layered, spiderweb lacing along the sides of the glass. Good retention on top. (Sight - 4.25). Initial smell reminded me of a Duet. Got grapefruit spices, Citra hops, tropical notes, mango notes late, caramel, nectarine rind and floral hops. (Smell - 4.25).  1,020 characters"	4.35
4345	Bad Boy	Need this again soon! Amazing dry hop that Alpine is known for. Smooth double ipa that starts with an amazing smell and ends with the perfect finish. My favorite double ipa!	4.91
4346	Bad Boy	A fantastic big hoppy IPA that is surprisingly easy to drink. Feels like a bigger version of Hoppy Birthday, this beer was a wonderful treat to share among friends.	4.75
4347	Bad Boy	This beer is served on tap/draught. It has a golden yellow/gold pour with a small white head. Aromas consist of a floral citrus/grapefruit blend. This taste begins as it smells with a piney and bitter aftertaste. A hint of orange can also be tasted. Overall smooth and balanced	4.43
4348	Bad Boy	Appearance- Received with almost a finger's worth of head which disappears as I write this. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale to medium amber which appears as a golden straw when held up to the light. Light lacing as with Alpine's other beers.. Nose- Have I mentioned that Alpine has hoppy beers on lockdown? Not bitter hophead beers but delicious fruity ones. More fruit notes with citrus notes taking the front (orange, lemon, and grapefruit). Some cherry. Notes of honey and caramel. Floral character. If this follows the aroma this is going to be the type of IIPA that I like.. Taste- Follows the nose to a certain extent. There is definitely a good amount of citrus (orange and lemon) and other fruits- cherry and peach at the moment. Good amount of honey and caramel. However, the best aspect of the flavor profile is one I can't really describe adequately. This is an extremely fresh and bright beer. Some pine and resin but not enough to render this a hophead's beer. The pine and resin does have a bit of linger which also shows some matchstick and grapefruit. Some orange and lemon peel. Caramel meets up with a bit of matchstick and makes it tastes a bit burnt. Some mustiness. Armpit and dirty socks. It is a little too cold to tell but I'm not as impressed with it as others seem to be. Certainly not in the same class as Notorious, Heady Topper, or Pliny the Younger at the moment..  2,191 characters	4.29
4349	Bad Boy	"Slight one finger off white head briefly rests atop a golden honey color that is clear as a bell.
Lacing is relatively slight in the Hill Farmstead Belgian stemware.. The nose is exceptionally bright and juicy, super juicy.Exploding with pineapple,mango and nectarine.. The taste is the payoff and a solid reflection of the amazing aroma: juicy tropical all the way.
Impossible to think Bad Boy is 9% abv as this is easily the most flavorful IIPA above 8% that reveals absolutely no alcohol, which is astounding. There is a slight warming in the throat after a full glass, but just an observation, not a negative..  1,008 characters"	4.99
4350	Bad Boy	On tap at Alpine Beer Company, Alpine, CA,. Now that Raul has just woken up from his coma... Like pulling out of a perfect double overhead barrel, this dang sucker is all West Coast. Like Amber Heard's bleached locks, this is a sunburst of ecstasy. Feeling it? Hells to the yeah, Raul is feeling it. Cleaner than your mama while at prom, this my friends, is Mecca.	4.82
4351	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"Drank at the source
Brown color with a thick thin beige head with short retention.
Aroma with notes of prunes, caramel, mild fresh floral hops, a bit of pine, nuts, and some chocolate.
Flavor with notes of floral and medicinal hops, some cocoa, mild candied sugar, prunes, pine, nuts, spices, wood, orange peel, coriander, berries, figs, vanilla and green pineapple. Dry aftertaste with a decent bitterness.
Medium body with somewhat effervescent carbonation. Alcohol of 8% is completely absent.
Aroma was a bit disappointing, but the mouth was quite nice given the fresh hops and complexity making this Dubbel as attractive as it can be. Sure, it does not compare to its big brother the 12th (unfair, different styles), but I had to keep raising the grade once it warmed up."	4.03
4352	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"Eureka ! I finally found it !
But, a friend had to bring it back from his visit to Belgium.
Westvleteren's rarity in the U.S. is understood, and the privilege of having one is appreciated.. Big bubbly brown foam, but I'd like more swirling protein. Smells are the famous fruits that I expected. Tastes follow closely in this very well-integrated beer. In the late palate as the brewers sugar recedes, the hops dry out the tongue in an unusual sensation... that I'd like to have again.. I went on their website. The Westvleteren monks have much to teach us. The primary lesson is simplicity. For example, they brew only three beers and all are world class. Focus. Something to think about."	4.51
4353	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Pours a dark brown body with a light brown head with low retention.. Spiced bouquet with nutmeg notes, raisin and prune from the yeast, some toasted caramel appear too.. Mild sweetness with caramel notes on the first plane, spiced notes also appear on the taste as nutmeg and raisin, prune and banana raisin. Low bitterness to balance the mild sweetness of the beer.  672 characters	4.6
4354	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	From a bottle picked up in Belgium. Dark brown color with a thick layer of tan head. Smells of bready malts, caramel, and dried fruit. Medium feel, fluffy and smooth. Tastes like it smells, bready malts, moderate sweetness, and dried fruits on the finish. Outstanding, one of the best I've had.	4.92
4355	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"L-Dark brown body with beige foam with proper thickness, which is lovely at first glance.
S-Bready, Honey, dried fruits such as prune, cherry, raisins
T-Quite a bit of sweetness, but not clear as Westvleteren 12. Also can taste dried fruits.
F-Very foamy and smooth
O-Quite heavy I think, which is the type I like, but if you want more sweetness, try Westvleteren12"	4.79
4356	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Moussy tan over oxblood; confectioners’ sugar, bright cherry, sarsaparilla, toffee, light clove, some banana + a touch of roses; cocoa, big black pepper, bread + butter pudding, marshmallow, prune, sticky toffee, + a bit of a floral end; smooth, moussy, medium.. 4.25 4.5 4.5 4.25 4.25. I’m thinking of Westmalle as I drink this, which is the standard bearer + a lovely beer, but this is so much more subtle, nuanced, and complex. You’re just compelled to keep sipping. All the quality. Model of the style.	4.41
4357	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Poured a brown body with khaki head and lace sheath down the glass. Aroma comes across as containing mild candi sugar/caramel (toffee?) malts sweetness, figs, raisins, other dark fruits like prunes, bread, and some floral hops. Smooth, creamy, the yeast keeps it smooth while the caramel/toffee(?)/(other) malts keep it sweet, yet you get the dark fruits, mainly some raisins and figs, along with some bread for filling body and the beer has great balance. Great beer, worth the hype, another Belgian that it is hard for me to even qualify and I'm glad I got the chance to try this beer.	4.37
4358	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Hazy brown color, beige head, aroma of caramel and dried fruits, medium sweetness, medium bitterness, medium carbonation, medium body, excellent beer.	4.74
4359	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"L -- Pours a lovely mahogany-brown body with a massive, pillow, three-finger off-white head produced with gentle pour. Fabulous retention and good lacing
S -- Brown bread, honey, banana, fig, prune, raisin, gingerbread, slightly oxidized herbal hops
T -- Largely follows the nose. A little bit of an almost saffron-like character, which is cool. The malts and yeast really work together nicely
F -- Medium mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Fluffy, soft mouthfeel and immensely drinkable
O -- Not quite of the caliber of Westy 12 but still damn good and a classic example of the style. Docking a quarter of a point for the high price point, even in Belgium. 89/100"	4.43
4360	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Aroma of tart cherries, spices (clove, something vaguely like gingerbread), lightly phenolic. Like sniffing a spicy holiday cake with some prunes or raisins baked in. Thin persistent off-white head, faint lacing. Colour is an opaque cola brown.. Flavour is rich -- bready -- but with noticeable hop bitterness. A bit sharper than Westmalle Dubbel, my personal favourite. More spices here, not overly sweet up front but a little sticky in the finish, aftertaste has a pleasant drying astringency that avoids the cloying character of some other (mainly domestic/North American) Belgian beers of similar appearance. Alcohol is not overly present, but is hard to miss. It's a warming brew, to be sure.. The fruit character is tilted towards the plum/raisin/prune side of things. Carbonation is noticeable but not excessive, has an almost creamy mouthfeel..  1,257 characters	4.16
4361	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Right up front I get the classic dark fruits. Plum, raisin and fig with a touch of dark cherry. The malt has a deep earthy and somewhat nutty quality with a very mild molasses like sweetness and bitterness playing off each other. I also get a light note of black licorice and some bitter bakers chocolate moving into the finish. The finish has a firm earthy almost leathery hop bitterness with a warming Sherry or Madeira like alcohol character.	4.72
4362	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Served in the Westvleteren glass. Dark brown colour, with amber tones when held against the light. Medium off white head that fades soon, leaving a ring around the glass. Small crying lace. Aroma is exceptional, raisins, dates, chocolate, candy sugar, toffee, some diacetyl notes, anise, wood, brandy, even some coffee. Medium body, creamy and oily texture, good carbonation. Sweet caramel finish. Taste is exceptional too, just following the aroma: Chocolate, anise, dates, raisins, brown sugar, licorice, notes of coffee, brandy... Just one of the best.	5
4363	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	From the bottle, it pours a dark brown with a modest light brown head that fades to a robust ring and a large continent in the middle. Dark rum in the nose. The mouth gets a sweetish dark fruit flavor that does go down well and easily. Nice feel as well. Yum!	4.47
4364	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Unsure of vintage. Poured into a teku. Amber in color, substantial head that eventually fades. Smells of subtle candied sugar, slight banana. Taste really floored me. Didn’t expect it to be that good. Candied sugar, light breast flavor. Super drinkable. I could put these away easily if I had a bunch. Overall, great beer. Really exceeded my expectations. Thanks Ray for sharing.	4.41
4365	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Thick rocky head. Tantalizing fingers of foam slide down the side of the glass. Dark brown-raisin color.. Aroma Strong on the dark rum,licorice and yeasty alcohol.. Strong acidity balances the malty character in the flavor perfectly. Spicy-dark fruits bring the complexity and keep each sip a little mysterious..  587 characters	4.8
4366	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Brown appearance with slight brown head. Aroma is a dark fruit slightly sweet. Taste is also a dark fruit that is slightly sweet. The feel is a little on the thin side.	4.23
4367	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Can't quite make out the date on the cap but it's the year 2020 at least.. A: Pours dark brown with an enormously huge light brown head. Head is towering and sticks around forever. When it finally does fade it leaves nearly solid lines of lacing on the glass.. S: Very bready, smells like bread crusts. Some dark fruits in there too..  878 characters	4.1
4368	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"Poured to a Leffe chalice.. A: The body is dark brown with a high haziness but not ""dirty"". Head has an amazing retention at one finger thick and is white. Plus, lots of lacing.
S: The aroma has tons of things. Raisins, blackberries, other berries, dark fruits, belgian ale yeast and a roasty malt profile. It's really amazing despite not being my type of beer. Alcohol is noticeable.
T: The taste has a beginning with raisins and blueberries. There's also a sense of dried fruits. In the back, a belgian yeast covers every flavour graciously, including the roastiness of the malts. Well done indeed.
M: Body is medium high. Carbonation is perfect. Alcohol is noticeable after the swallow, slightly. Really good.
O: Only my second Westy, and but thankfully also as good as 12. Remarkable despite being far from my kind of dubbels. Praise this beer!"	4.54
4369	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Tasted from bottle. Tasted head to head with Westy 12. Pours a dark brown with off white head identical to Westy 12. Aroma is not near as strong but similar. Notes of dark fruits, caramel, maple syrup, toffee. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than Westy 12 but still chewy and sticky. Flavors of brown sugar, maple syrup, figs, plums, raisins, caramel, toffee. Overall excellent for being the little brother to 12.	4.24
4370	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Muddy, ruddy brown with a fat finger of creamy, tan head.. Raisins, figs, prune, cherry and slight earthy hops in the nose. Similar tasting with a moderate bitterness and very clean finish with just a hint of sweetness and bitterness duking it out. Incredibly well balanced in that regard.. Medium bodied, slightly chewy with heavy carbonation. Very, very tasty.	4.4
4371	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"My last night in Rome...sadly... and after having had the opportunity to taste and savor the masterful and legendary Westvleteren XII, I crack open a bottle of Westvleteren VIII. It is with great anticipation that I await to see if it will be filled with the same superlative qualities.
It pours an opaque brown and mahogany color. As I pour I hear the carbonation fizzing and sparkling softly, despite it not being visible within its murky colors. A huge foamy tan head retains for seemingly an eternity.
As I await for the head to dissipate, I hold the glass up to my nose. It starts off modestly with aromas of dark bread, spice, prune, plum and a hint of citrus peel.
The head has now receded slightly and displays a thick and creamy blanket of film. As I put it in my lips I'm amazed by the smooth and silky feel. The gentle carbonation belies the sound I heard earlier and adds to its soft mouthfeel. I first taste amber malts balanced with spice. The overall palate feels dry and with a light hops touch in the finish. The body feels medium and drinkable.
Already, this is a great brew, yet, aromas and flavors continue to open up. Holding it up to my nose I smell cloves and light cocoa. The subtle cocoa sweetness expresses itself in the flavor. Fruity esters of raisins, prunes and plums make their presence felt. The hops bitterness begins to increase in a slow and steady crescendo. The malt flavors open up; light dark caramel and slight roasty quality. I hold up the glass to my nose and smell candi sugar and cherries. The bitterness from the hops continues to increase and leaves an earthy dark linger in the finish.
As I get towards the final phase of the drink, the sea foam like lace adorns and sticks to the glass. There is a slight grapefruit peel and flavor of cherries as I gulp down the last few sips.
A sublime and masterful drink. Probably the best Dubbel I've had to date. The only question that remains is whether it is the equal of Westy 12. Perhaps an unfair comparison considering they are slightly different styles. Although Westvleteren VIII has a bit less alcohol and a tad lighter in body, they have so many similar qualities. I feel like I enjoyed this one just as much and feel it is only fair to also give it the same perfect score I gave Westvleteren XII."	5
4372	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	Pours dark nut-brown; reddish rims. Maintains a nice cap and lacing thorughout.. Smell is nut and raisin, with molasses and malty butter added on the palette. Quite muted - possibly over-aged on my part. Velvet-smooth, as expected, with a prickle of carbonation. The alcohol is completely hidden.	4.32
4373	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"Look: dark brown, moderate head.
Smell and taste: very similar to the 12 in terms of the types of flavors that come up, including spices, grains, and some fruity sweetness. The main difference lay in the fact that these flavors didn't keep delivering as I made my way through the glass; they didn't retain the same liveliness and longevity as they had in the 12.
Feel: Good, but distinctively not full bodied."	4.36
4374	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	"Quite ascetic as other Wv beers.
Excellent look, eternal as hell retention, tons of laces and foam rocks.
Rather ordinary aroma characteristrics - caramel, dark fruits.
Taste -
Medium body and carbomnation, nutty on a palate.
Fantastically balanced, but not the best dubbel."	4.18
4375	Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII)	L - Hazy brown/dark red, nice white head. S - the highlight of the beer. A lots of dark fruits. Mostly dates, vinous notes. Quite complex. T - Vinous and a lot about dark fruits, spicy and tannin full taste. The hops are floral. Same grain presence you can find in Westmalle Dubbel. The taste is quite dry even if the smell make you wish for a more sweet taste.  603 characters	4.31
4376	Crusher	"16 oz can from egrandfield!
Yakima Valley Hops glass. Golden turbid blonde with an orange blush, creamy head of 1 finger receding to a ring, less lace than most Alchy beers but still pleasing to the eye.. My first reaction to the aroma is, ""Holy Crap!"", that's A LOT of hops. Like walking into a hop yard after a fresh rain. Tons of orange juice-y aromas, with some mango, flower, evergreen, and grapefruit. It's fantastic..  1,122 characters"	4.48
4377	Crusher	West Coast meets New England. Strong, but not boozy. Very bitter, but with a hearty backbone. Goes down much easier than expected. Tbh, I think I might like this better than Heady.	5
4378	Crusher	This one is probably worthy of a full review... First great label - Fairly simple but the green and yellow really pop... Color is a slightly hazy mango-ish pale orange... Whipped white head with stellar retention... A bit of lacing clings to the glass... The aroma is everything you would expect - a wide array of tropical fruit and light pine... I could keep my nose hovered over the glass all day... Robust flavor with depth and exceptional mouthfeel... Big flavor but subtle mouthfeel... As expected a word class beer and exceptional IPA... Cheers...	4.66
4379	Crusher	Really vibrant hop bomb, feels much closer to a west coast ipa than NEIPA, incredibly drinkable, lives up to the name. Great beer. Citrus, white grape, sweet malt, earthy, dank, nice hop bitterness. Crusher.	4.45
4380	Crusher	"Sampled at Stowe brewery and just had a can I brought home. Beer < 3 weeks old.
Poured a beautiful plumy small bead head on an opaque mildly burnt orange body.
Nose was orange and soft dank; flavor much fuller on fruit especially grapefruit as well as more noticeable pine. Super smooth easy sipper.
Another excellently crafted Alchemist IPA."	4.44
4381	Crusher	"I picked up a 4-pack of this at the brewery on 20MAY19, and set out to quaff a couple in The 'Zebo on 27MAY19.. It was a deep golden color, like apricot jam. Had steady carbo, and a frothy, light-tan head. The topping was a healthy 1"" and ebbed back quite slowly, with excellent lacing on the glass. Had a citrussy nose, with apricot and tangerine all over. Body was medium-plus, and it was rather smooth, overall.. Flavor had more semi-sweet fruit - tangerine and apricot once more, plus a smidge of bittering fruit, like grapefruit and pineapple. It was also resiny, dank and a little piney before finishing on the dry side. A wonderful mix, indeed! Prosit!.  750 characters"	4.31
4382	Crusher	A: poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, this looked green coming out of the can from all the hops, orange with a huge white head that lingers leaving good lacing, cloudy with bits. S: huge hop aroma, grapefruit, pine, sweet tropical fruits. T: bitter pine and grapefruit up front, sweet malt, honey, tropical fruits.  388 characters	4.62
4383	Crusher	"No date on the can, but this one's pretty fresh. Really excited to finally get to try this New England Classic.. Pours a deep, hazy orange with gobs of white head that rise up to about two fingers above the beer. As it settles, huge amounts of froth cling to the inside of the glass, while its weaker counterparts slip helplessly into the beer itself. As warned, I got my fair share of sediment in this can as well. No harm no foul.. Sweet, dank nose on this. Tons of herbal, grassy, piney hops compliment an abundance of grapefruit aromas. Really great contrast of sweet citrus and pithy hops, with a complex aroma that really embodies every great quality of a true, ""old school"" American Double IPA..  1,277 characters"	4.57
4384	Crusher	No canning date (purchased at brewery on 3/8/19; presumably canned within a week of that time). Pours a hazy dark orange huge topped with a thick, verging on creamy, white head. Great retention leaves plenty of soapy lacing, a faint, frothy cap, and an ample collar; all the appearance of a great-looking beer despite the sizable chunks of sediment floating around.. Aromas of ruby red grapefruit and peach skins are intense straight away, while backing notes of orange pulp, blackberry/blueberry smoothie, and dank eucalyptus round out a bouquet that's every bit fruity as it is saturated (albeit subtly) with herbal and ‘sweeter’ hop tones. Amazing exposure of hop diversity and depth..  1,607 characters	4.41
4385	Crusher	Canned fall 2016; drank 9/17/16 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque orange appearance.. Huge white head; frothy lace..  334 characters	3.98
4386	Crusher	No canning date spotted, but I purchased this 5 days ago.. A: Pours a lightly hazy pale sort of orange I guess? Tall frothy light tan head. Great head retention and lacing.. S: Interesting. I was expecting a huge aroma but it's pretty subtle. Citrus, pine, tropical fruits along with some malt sweetness..  1,017 characters	4.21
4387	Crusher	The Alchemist's Crusher is what craft beer should be all about -- seizing the opportunity to create something memorable, rather than adhering to comfortable standards. Poured from a 16 oz. can to a typical pint glass, Crusher took on a dark pineapple appearance. The smell was incredibly balanced and inviting. The taste, however, highlighted the experience. The piney/dank flavor (some hints of fresh scallion) was complimented by muted, citrusy notes. I'm a big fan of Six Point's Resin, but Crusher steps the style up a level.	4.27
4388	Crusher	Hazy apricot color with sudsy white head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is just straight fresh hoppiness. Bitter everywhere; up front, in the middle, at the end. Some light waves of peach, pine, and mango, but bitterness dominates. Dry and crisp. Good carbonation. This beer is all about fresh hops. Usually not a fan of overwhelming bitterness, but this is a great beer.	4.2
4389	Crusher	Tarnished orange in color with a murky, hazy appearance. Poured with a tall, creamy white foam with very good retention. Herbal, earthy, dank hop aromas with a hint of over-ripe orange. Medium malty aroma. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Pleasant, creamy smooth feel with light richness followed by boozy warmth through the finish. Herbal, dank hop flavors with a solid malty backbone. Medium high, spicy hop bitterness through the middle that taper to pinr hop flavors and boozy heat. Finished with lingering pine hop bitterness and light, prickly boozy notes. Dank and bitter with a enough malt to balance the hop character and a pleasant booziness. 	4.26
4390	Crusher	"L. Very hazy burnt orange color, thick froth head which recedes slowly.
S. Bitter citrus, pine, white bread, pineapple, mango. Yep, smells great.
T. Mild mango, piney, pithy, oranges, lemons and limes, green vegetables, a little more pine, light malt, white bread. Aftertaste is grapefruit and pine.
F. Leaning toward a full feel, resinous, dry.
O. Great balance between a soft sweetness and potent hoppy flavors, with a firm yet somewhat controlled bitterness. I'm not sure I've tasted a better IPA. Cheers!"	4.72
4391	Crusher	Hazy orange with four fingers of long-lasting yellowed, antique white head. Heavy webbed lacing.. Green onion, pine, weed and orange citrus in the nose.. These elements continue to the taste where they’re joined by strong bitterness, as well as a solid malt backbone and some light nuttiness. There’s a hint of tropical fruit behind everything in both the aroma and taste, too, but it’s just about buried..  618 characters	4.09
4392	Crusher	"**
12/11/18. Can to Wine glass.. LOOK: Hazy yellow, with a big healthy white head. excellent retention. large bubbles and foam stick around through out.
AROMA: Metallic hoppy, pine, light citrus.
TASTE: more of the citrus and metallic flavors, but the pine takes off here and dominates. Nice at first, but gets sappy midway through.
FEEL: super creamy. there is a thickness to it, but it is very drinkable and ""crusher-able""..  576 characters"	3.97
4393	Crusher	"A bit less balanced than its Alchemist counterparts, Crusher remains a strong and bold brew. Packed with hops, it delivers a big green bitterness. You've got also some tropical fruits and citrus notes.
The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth.
Nice, nice, nice"	4.51
4394	Crusher	"Pours medium orange with a sharp head
Mouth feel is acidic and slightly bitter
Nose is bland
Seemed better as it sat for a few minutes
I expected more but overall decent beer
Said 9% on website but can says 8?"	3.13
4395	Crusher	"A-Pours a hazy golden color with a nice head and lacing
A-Aroma has hoppy and citrus hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a nice hoppy and citrus flavor
M-A medium bodied well carbonated beer
O- A nice DIPA"	4.65
4396	Crusher	A little boozier than I like but, its a beautiful amber beer with a strong citrus and floral smell. The finish is dry and leaves a grassy aftertaste. For a traditional VT IPA this is delicious and strong!	4.39
4397	Crusher	DATE: September 23, 2018... OCCASION: sampling another of Jeff's Vermont pickups--FYI, this one is the 8% ABV... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours quite a bright, hazy lemon-yellow body alive with flecks of sediment and tiny, busy bubbles... its head is nearly four fingers of sudsy, soapy, cavernous white that caves in on itself while clinging to the glass--almost too attractive to disturb with a sip... prolonging that, first sniff is thick with juicy resin, lemon citrus, pineapple, mango, and papaya--despite the label, Crusher doesn't suggest any semblance of malt in its aroma... though I would have loved to experience this at 9.6%ABV, the 8% in my glass is plenty rousing, bitter, and Pavlovian in its mouth-watering trigger.... so much so, that the aftertaste lingers almost into its next sip, despite its dry finish.... medium-bodied but a live mouthful... the resin slays the tastebuds, massive and resounding with lemon, grapefruit and mango elbowing everything else out of the profile... light like a Belgian, sneaky with its ABV, great as a dessertif or a nightcap... one of the best one-dimensional offerings I have had, singular in its mission and massive in its effect....	4.36
4398	Crusher	"Look - poured into an Alchemist IPA glass from a 16 oz can. Beer is lemon yellow in color, hazy, and has a beautiful three finger head with great retention and plenty of lacing. A real work of art.
Smell - a myriad of hoppy flavors, including (but not limited to) citrus, pine, tropical fruits, and a hint of sweetness.
Taste - incredibly smooth. Complex but not overpowering hoppy flavor right from the start to the finish. Despite the complexity, the flavors are extremely well balanced and has a clean, dry finish.
Feel - medium bodied, with below average carbonation. At 8% ABV, the alcohol in this beer is very well masked and barely detectable.
Overall - an incredibly easy to drink double IPA that is bursting with flavor. A real treat."	4.52
4399	Crusher	"CAN
Hazy dirty blonde; orange peel, dank, ganga, + hard candy; slight oyster cracker then ringing orange, slight resin, then jagged little bits of pith, some sparkly citrus candy, IBUs + some burn; greasy.. 4 4 4.25 4 4.25. Weirdly not a NEIPA - I forget that Alchemist does that. Very West Coast hopping. Brightens as it goes, but suffers after drinking a bunch of Other Half in the same session. Damn hoppy, if nothing else. Might need to revisit."	4.15
4400	Crusher	16oz can: This one pours a hazy golden color. There was a white head that leaves some lacing. Nice nose of lots of hops. Citrus, tropical fruits and pine. Possibly a touch of breadiness too. The taste is very good. Just a bit of bitterness, but no real sweetness to it. A wonderful blend of all the aforementioned hops.	4.34
4401	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"Been a while. I think I remember how these used to go .... forgive me if my palate has grown unrefined over the years.. Looks: Pours a surprisingly bubbly (white foam topping) yellow. Somewhat hazy. Carbonation dies down almost instantly.. Smell: Ah, that's the stuff. Pungent. You can almost feel the zest wafting into your nose (the smell of ""zest"" is similar to the smell of burning toast when you've had a stroke)..  1,370 characters"	4.6
4402	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"Eyecatching body, like apricot jam, or a fuzzy peach candy. Opaque. Fizzes like champagne, and build light, short, egg-white head, but it's short-lived, leaving a rim within the minute.
Peach and apricot confiture, or stewed appled, with herbs like rosemary or thyme. It's like autumn, savoury sweet.
Lightly tart, a touch vinegary. Orchard fruit - sweet apples, apricot, peach - all fermented. Even orange. A sense of the farm, with a light mustiness. After initial draft review, realize that it was the oak aging I was picking up. Super dry finish, puckering and begging for another sip. Really amazing flavour, intense but sophisticated and subtle. Fine, champagne-like carbonation (though a touch too light), medium body. Feels refined and effervescent, yet soft.. Fantastic. Provided you enjoy sours, as the vinegar note might be off-putting to some. Complex, natural flavours, with pronounced but deftly managed sour & fermented orchard fruit flavour."	4.35
4403	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Strong head production, with over two fingers of fluffy, gorgeous snow white head from a moderate pour. Retention is good, leaving no lacing behind. Almost a milky haze to the burnished gold body, light straw color in the sun. Some liveliness as well, but it's not a sparkling body.. Sour and funky nose, along with waves of oak, honey, and wildflowers that occasionally waft over from feet away. Vinegar, hay, flowers, honey, oak, must, very light skunk, grass, apple; it's a complex melange of potent aromas that is really difficult to describe, like the wind blowing through the trees and carrying with it all of the notes of the forest mixed together.. Tart and mildly fizzy on the palate, with a sourness that comes across almost neutral and a touch vinegary. The sourness yields to robust oaky tones, but as the finish quickly sets in with tones of apple, pear, and cider, the sour clings to the gums. Similarly musty and very slightly skunky on the palate, with tones of earth, leather, tannins, and mushrooms..  2,220 characters	4.51
4404	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Just wow. I’m guess this is what a Belgian Gueuze should be. Rich golden hues, frothy foamy head, slightly hazy. Smell is funky bret on the forefront with some wood barrel and hints of tart green apple. Taste is where this beer steps up-it’s sour and tart at the same time, but gently so. There’s oakiness, but nothing overly boozy. It’s really flavorful, but subtly so. Feel is also outstanding-crisp, clean, refreshing, dry, almost sparkling wine like. Just an amazing beer. I guess I’ve never rated this style before. Going to have to find more examples, because if they’re like this, I’m going to love them.	4.75
4405	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"Acquired at the brewery. Bottle made a loud stomp, but nothing spilled over.
Slightly hazy golden orange color with a thin head with decent retention.
Predominant funky aroma with notes of white pepper, a bit of wood, green apples, horse sweat, sulfur, lemon, lavender and grains.
Flavor with notes of lemon pie, horse mantle, green apples, grapefruit, aged hops, lactic acid, wheat, grains, funky earthiness and citrus, honey and cranberries. Dry and sour aftertaste.
Light body with effervescent carbonation. Alcohol of 6.3% is completely absent.
Funky and bold Gueuze with deep citrusy and spiced notes. Flavor surprised with an initial elegance that followed by a delayed puckering effect. Going towards puckering chasers rather than by the book balance that Cantillon for instance usually achieves."	3.93
4406	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Currently #184 in the Top 250 beers list and the #7 Gueuze.. Blend #29 of the 2017/2018 season. 3.5yr lambic brewed in 2014. $13 for a 6oz bottle pour during Zwanze Day at Avenue Pub in New Orleans, LA.. Pours a supple 2cm white head that reduces to .5cm within a minute and stays there another 10. Body is a vibrant orange. Translucent yet nontransparent. I see no yeast/Lee's within, but I didn't see the level of liquid in the bottle..  2,084 characters	4.5
4407	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	On tap at The Veil Summer Fest. How lucky we are. Light amber color with a good head. Nose is lemon and apple, with yeast funk to it. Taste generally follows. Nice and crisp, very well-carbonated, dry and refreshing. Construction of this one just off the charts, so I give that part a 5. Drink it if you can find it.	4.48
4408	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"2019-09-08
750ml corked/caged bottle served in a 3 Fonteinen glass. Bottled 14 Nov 2017.. Pours clear, light amber, big head, tons of carbonation. Smell is oaky, tart, a little lemon.. Taste is oak, tart, a little funk, some lemon. Mouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, it's very good."	4.49
4409	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Look: Hazy dark orange with a massive FOUR fingers of foamy white head that dissipates within less than a minute. I'm sure I could have gotten it taller.. Smell: Vinegar, band-aids, citrus, yeast funk. Very typical gueuze.. Taste: Savory, almost like smoked meat. Vinegar and acidic lemon sharpness balance..  472 characters	4.13
4410	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"Look - golden amber color with a haze and looks fairly thick with a slight head
Smell - funky vinegar slight citrus scent
taste - sweet lemon green apple tartness and a slight woodiness to it
feel - full body with a lighter crisp carbonatoin
overall - tasty tart beer"	4.28
4411	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"750 mL Bottle. ABV 6.2%.
Appearance: Golden/Orange, Under a finger of bright white fluffy head, good retention.
Aroma: Complex, Citrus (bright lemon, lime, white grapefruit), Floral, Vinegar, Funky, Lovely aromatics.
Mouthfeel: Under medium body, Delicate, Clean, Layered, Slightly slick, Airy, Noticeable carbonation, Dry finish.
Flavour: Lemon, Citrus, Funky minerality, Slight bitterness, Slight grass, Wood accents, Surprisingly less complex than aroma.
Overall: Fantastic complexity in the aroma. What a pleasant all-around beer. I'll sit on my other bottle for a while."	4.4
4412	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"A: Pours a pale amber/golden color with a slightly off white soapy head. Lacing is pretty good considering the ABV and the retention keeps on after quickly losing 3/4 of the head.. S: Smell intensity is medium to low. You get some funk with horseblanket and wet hay. The lavender and honey they add do shine through and gives a nice pleasant balance. A little bit of lemon-y tartness comes off in the smell.. T: Where the smell doesn't indicate much tartness, the taste comes through big time. You get a lot of lemon-y tartness with lemon rind like flavors. Quite a bit of funk too with horseblanket, wet hay and musk. The lavender and honey do help with the balance as the beer would have been VERY dry without it and the honey doesn't feel ""sugary"" but adds to the juiciness of the beer. The lavender gives a nice pleasant twist to the beer. Some pepper and cloves from the yeast comes through. Beautiful tasting beer..  1,220 characters"	4.54
4413	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Poor almost golden orange with a little head. Bubbly more than frothy head. Sour nose which lend well to the mouth. Almost champagne like body yet thicker feel on the tongue. The taste is intense with funky earthy tartness. Slightly acid aftertaste. Amazing geuze of the highest calibre.	4.84
4414	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Pours an effervescent gold/amber with 2 fingers of ivory colored head. Zero lacing & head retention. S: Orchard fruit, a touch of vinegar. T: Follows the nose with pears & Golden Delicious Apple with tartness & a little sourness up front. Tartness takes over as this warms, lemon & apples mostly. Finishes tart with lemons and just a touch apple sweetness.  485 characters	4.35
4415	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Caged and corked bottle poured into a tulip glass. Solid two finger off white dense creamy fluffy foam cap, strong carbonation on the pour with active streams, settles to a dense layer with great retention, some lacings over a hazy golden orange. Aroma is tart, crisp apples, slightly lemon.  457 characters	4.52
4416	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"The best gueuze I've had ever.. Perfectly balanced.
Soft dough notes, some stone fruits notes, some funkiness but mastered.
The smooth and champagne-like carbonation. Keep it coming!!"	4.78
4417	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	I will preface this review by first saying I can't believe just how good this beer is. It's safe to say it is the best lambic I have ever had. This was brewed 14 March, 2018.. Poured in a pint glass, there was a tall but airy white head over a brew the color of honey.. Aroma was citrus and almost reminded me slightly of white wine with oakiness. Also a hint of honey..  762 characters	4.75
4418	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Pours a rich gold, champagne carbonation but the little head that is there fades instantly. Aroma of wet oak, funky yeast, vinegar and overripe apple - a bit heavy on the lactic spectrum. Palate begins with tart lemon, a fair bit of sugary malt (for a gueuze, anyway), a smoother lactic dose of sourness, cider wort. I more of a tart (brett) fan over sour (lacto), this is more the later. Mouthfeel is oily and heavy for the style. Good, but a bit too vinegary & weighty for what I personally look for in a gueuze	3.85
4419	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"poured from a 375mL bottle into a wine glass. pours a vibrant burnt orange with a finger and a half of soapy white head. smells of blue cheese, dirty socks, pithy orange, lemon, lime and hay. taste is similar. get a lot of underlying funk (blue cheese, barn funk, hay) with sharp acidic fruitiness. it’s not at all a pucker up sourness. very mild. it’s really quite wonderful. mouthfeel is lively yet not overly carbonated. definitely thick, if that’s how you even describe lambic mouthfeel. not at all watery even on the finish. overall this is quite a delightful drinking experience. i am by no means a lambic expert but this one i have had several times now and with different

4420	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Bottled 18 months ago.. Pours yellow with a light chill haze and thin head.. The nose and taste feature lemon, apple, cranberry, almond, and grain. Tasty..  241 characters	4.42
4421	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	This one pours golden with strong carbonation with a white frothy head, reminiscent of champagne. The nose is acidic with sweettarts, apples and hay. There is also a light funk in the nose. The taste is dry and tart with hints of apple, lemon and hay. The backend is clean and refreshing making this one easy to drink. The mouthfeel is overall light but with the right amount of carbonation that supports the flavor profile. Overall, a very nice gueuze that is more polished and refined that the traditional Drie Fonteinen Gueuze.	4.63
4422	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Blend n 26 season 17/18. Golden hue, smell of strong minerality. Taste is mild minerality up front, sweetness, and a dry clean finish. Mouth is effervescent and clean.. Dreg is intensified minerality..  258 characters	4.55
4423	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Amber appearance with significant white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a slightly sour fruit. Taste is very dry slightly tart non-citrus fruit	4.31
4424	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	Bottle. Poured a cloudy golden orange. Fizzly head. Aroma was awesome. Really rustic and deep. Soily. High intensity. Earthy, funky, tart. Flavor was excellent as well. A very tasty Gueuze that is clearly a standard deviation above most of the style in terms of flavor and aroma.	4.5
4425	Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston	"2017/18 from the bottle. 6.7% abv. What a treat.... A deep orange body cascades into and is surrounded by a soft clear golden yellow glow. In opposition, streams of tiny bubbles rise from the belly to support a thin, bone white ring of foam with tiny scattered islands.. The smell is absolutely stunning. It has the usual suspects of a great geuze, but somehow adds another layer that says ""this is something special"". Acidic, woody, zesty, funky, sweet. Like limes, apricots, and peaches took a vinegar bath in a well loved Foeder..  1,396 characters"	4.59
4426	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Pour a nice smooth dark color smells of huge maple drinks a little thin but great flavor bacon kicks in on the finish great beer 2nd year for me awesome	4.82
4427	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Black in color with no penetration to light. No head. The aroma is of intensely dark black roasted coffee and dark malt. I’m tasting dark coffee, bacon fat, and dark malt. The mouth is oily, thick, and viscous.	4.24
4428	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	2016 vintage; drank 4/21/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. Brown/black appearance.. Big tan head; minimal lace..  364 characters	4
4429	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	A jet black pour with a fast tan head. The nose is insanely good-Sunday morning breakfast at grandma's with waffles, syrup, and bacon in a bottle. The drinking hits with sweet chocolate malts upfront, a smooth flow and a semi-dry finish. On the sweeter side of the spectrum but its not over-kill. There is a lot going on here. Big flowing flavors of sweet maple syrup, soft coffee grinds, and subtle smoke. Additional notes of vanilla, brown sugar, cocoa, and caramel. A rather moderate mouthfeel that offers a lush, rich, and creamy feel. Nothing to off-putting in terms of chalk or cola flavoring.. Overall, just a crazy good porter.	4.91
4430	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	A - Pours a pitch black with a one finger tan head. Very light soapy lacing.. S - Aroma is maple, roasted malts and bacon.. T - The taste is maple, coffee, roasted malts and salty bacon..  392 characters	4.31
4431	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"Pours black with two fingers of khaki head.
Smells is very maple forward, roasty malts, coffee.
Taste follows, sweet maple syrup up front, coffee, roasty malt. Not really finding the bacon though, maybe a hint of saltiness.
Feel is a bit thin for me. I know it's a porter so I wasn't expecting it to be chewy but a bit more body would have been nice.
Overall a tasty adjunct porter, flavors blend well, not overly sweet as some maple beers are. Again a bit more body would put this much higher."	4.33
4432	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Bomber received in a trade. 2017 edition, opened 2.16.19. Motor oil liquid, one finger brown frothy foam cap quickly recedes.  269 characters	4.48
4433	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Pours black with an extremely well retained half inch khaki head that left lacing that looks like a map of Hawaii. Smells of strong maple syrup, coffee, smoke and chocolate. Tastes of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, smoked bacon, molasses, toffee and sweet malts. Medium to full bodied for the style, well carbonated, creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish.	4.54
4434	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	650ml bottle, 2018 vintage, poured into an oversized Funky Buddha snifter glass. Enjoyed on 11.24.18, reviewed from Tasting Journey.. The beer pours a jet black color, thick and with a nice viscosity, opaque with a loose khaki head that rises nicely with moderate retention and lacing. The aroma is pleasant, sweet and rich maple leaps out with chocolate and roasty coffee, dark grains, cream and a nice salinity emerges that evokes bacon. The flavors are good, really coffee forward with a nice roast, moderate acidity but a good richness that plays nicely with toasted dark malts while the maple comes out behind the roasted quality toning down the beer and bringing out some cream flavors while a lingering saltiness washes the palate. The mouthfeel is okay, a thinner medium body that coats well, lively and bubbly texture with a nice soft finish.. Verdict: A good adjunct porter from Funky Buddha. The texture is a bit thin relative to the amount of flavor packed into this beer while causes there to be a bit of balance issue. In terms of the actual flavors involved, the maple and bacon are great nuances to what is a very coffee forward beer.	4.01
4435	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"Funky Buddha Brewery ""Maple Bacon Coffee Porter""
22 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, ""BOTTLED ON 12/28/17..."" and sampled on 12/26/18. Notes via stream of consciousness: First off, this is labeled as ""2018"" and yet they packaged it in 2017. So they actually sat on it for a year to age it? Interesting. It's poured a typical porter/stout appearance with a black body beneath a creamy head of khaki colored foam. The aroma is fantastic, it smells like a coffee liquor. It melds sweet maple syrup with black coffee and chocolate syrup, and for whatever reason that's taken me for a moment back to my days in the Boy Scouts. It's clean and bright and enticing although I haven't really found the bacon yet, just a suggestion of it. OK, on to the flavor... more coffee, basic, but good, just like a regular cup of Joe black coffee... more maple syrup as expected, and kind of sweet... chocolate syrup... some vanilla... but I'm still not finding the bacon. I wasn't really expecting bacon, but maybe some apple smoked wood maltiness...? Or am I missing it? I get coffee, maple, toffee, almost burnt but not sugar, vanilla, medium to darker caramel, some background fruitiness, and a bit of ashen roastiness. Is it smoky? I don't think so, not really, there is some in the far away background but I wouldn't consider it smoky. Still, it's good. It's nice and rich without being overly so, and sweetish but not too sweet although some of that maple sugar does linger on the palate. It's not really a dessert beer though, or is it? It could certainly be used as an ingredient in a dessert but it is rich enough to be a dessert beer on its own? Ahhh, maybe. So, OK, what else? Medium bodied and gently crisp then smooth.. Review# 6,436"	4.25
4436	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	2018 version. Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Thanks bro for shipping to me from Tampa.. Dark brown with a nice creamy tan head. Some sticky lacing clings to the glass.. Strong smell of toffee, maple, burnt caramel. Lighter smell of coffee, vanilla and smoke. My mouth is watering..  745 characters	4.34
4437	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"Appearance: Jet black, no light passing through this one
Nose: Heavy maple. Like someone watered down maple syrup.
Taste: Heavy maple, some coffee, light smokiness. Sweet.
Texture: Much thinner than I am used to but I generally drink higher ABV stouts and porters. The thinness isn't unpleasant just a little unexpected. Great carbonation
Overall: Great beer I would recommend to anyone into maple and coffee."	4.5
4438	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"Bottle Date: 2017
Palate Contaminants: another stout. Dark brown, but it lets a little light through at the edge. Medium-fine carbonation, and what little head is there goes away pretty quickly.. First thing that crosses my mind regarding the nose is brown sugar, then after a few seconds, there's very obviously maple. That just blankets anything else, but I do happen to really like maple. Sweet graininess is akin to sorghum..  970 characters"	4.21
4439	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	2018 batch, bottled on 12/28/17. I shouldn’t have sat on this for so long!!! At ten months old it definitely isn’t fresh but it’s still great. Don’t know why I didn’t drink this when I bought it in the summer. Regardless, the nose is incredible. Everything is as described. Super roasty, sweet yet salty, and rich without being filling. A true dessert beer that finishes smooth and clean as a porter should versus this being a heavy stout. Hopefully I can try the 2019 fresh. Bravo FB!	4.53
4440	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	LLOOOOOONNNG time want that I now get to check off thanks to @Dragginballs76's generosity during NBS BIF #8.. Cola black body that's about as fizzy. Massive light brown head that is almost like a root beer float... when the soda and ice cream interact. You can hear the bubbles popping as it builds up and then settles down. Wet bubbles. Settles down to a few lazy bubbles sitting on the liquid.. Nose is immediate and dominant. Big roasty and salty/smoky/greasy with that sweet sweet syrup from the maple. The lighter sweeter maple though that seems to be more prevalent in beers rather than the dark rich stuff that is the best on... well just about anything tasty really..  792 characters	4.22
4441	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	L: dark brownish red, a little light can pass through this. It isn’t sludge.. S: amazing smell. Maple and coffee hit you in the face.. T: very good. Starts off coffee, then some salt and maybe a little smoke, with a nice maple finish. A little bit of roasty malt and toffee flavor from the beer itself, but it stays in the background throughout..  666 characters	4.37
4442	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Pours black as Satan's heart. Rich thick world class head volume, lacing and quite outstanding retention.. It smells as good as it looks. The nose is world class. The base is sweet chocolate, toffee and caramel with a nice dose of maple. The coffee notes are gently subtle as is the light touch of smoke. The smoke is most noticeable on the exhale. An exquisitely complex aroma with a very small roast aspect.. Heavy medium bodied with a slightly creamy mouthfeel that comes across as quite smooth. The carbonation / body balance is outstanding. The middle is lightly effervescent while the finish is slightly prickly and thus helps the body..  1,086 characters	4.45
4443	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"Black with some red around the edges. Light tan head.
Maple syrup and coffee aroma. A hint of smoke.
Great taste. Maple syrup, coffee, caramel.
Smooth and creamy mouthfeel."	4.57
4444	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"A: The beer is black when viewed from afar, but when held up the light there are traces of brown are visible near the edges of the glass. It poured with a short tan head that died down, leaving wisps of bubbles on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of coffee beans are present in the nose along with faint hints of smoke from the bacon.
T: The taste has flavors of maple along with notes of coffee beans.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This would make for an excellent choice for a breakfast beer as it combines flavors of coffee with maple syrup, although I didn't pick up any bacon, except for the hints of smoke in the smell.. Serving type: bottle"	4.29
4445	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"2018 bottle poured into tulip. Bottled 12/29/2017.
Upon opening I set the bottle down to get a glass. I could smell the maple from at least a foot away. Pours a dark brown with larger tan head. With the maple, I could smell a smoky meat also. Taste is maple syrup to start, smokiness, with a big coffee finish. Some acridity which might be from the smoke. Thinner mouthfeel than I prefer with slight carbonation.
Glad to cross off this want, great beer. This beer says everything it’s going to be on the label and nails it. I’d buy another bottle in the future."	4.35
4446	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Came a deep dark cola color with that tinge of red with a creamy deep beige head that never really settled,good deep color and a good looking head.The aromas were just amazing,deep sweet maple and mild smoky pork wich you really can't go wrong with,chocolate and brown sugar notes also came into play,everything you want in a porter.Dark roast coffee cuts thru some of the big brown sugar and maple flavors with a smokiness in the finish that never lets this beer get to sweet,no alcohol sweetness either wich makes everything come together very well.This beer lives up to billing,everything plays a role in the nose and palate,great stuff.	4.44
4447	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	"22oz bottle picked up for $14, poured into snifter.
A: pours a crayon black with tinges of ruby red, thin off white foam head slowly forms after the pour is finished and fades away
S: fresh maple syrup, bacon cooking in a skillet, fresh roasted coffee, malty
M: medium creamy body that has a wet and sticky finish
T: maple syrup, bacon, carbonation is puckering on the tongue, coca cola, sweet, light coffee bitterness towards the finish
O: desert brew, breakfast brew, I'm not sure but the flavors are genuine and spot on"	4.3
4448	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Pours black with dark brown around the edges, with a nice thumb sized tan head that leaves some light lace.. Aroma is nice roasted malts, lots of sweet maple syrup, good smoke notes with lighter coffee and toffee mingled through out. Guessing the smokey notes is suppose to be bacon because no real bacon notes. But smells wonderful and complex especially since its only 6.4%. Taste is roasted, again good sweet maple upfront, nice chocolate and toffee mingled, really on the sweeter side. Finish is lingering roasted sweetness, lighter coffee along with the smoke notes and light salty hints. Again no real bacon but its pretty favorable for the lower abv..  935 characters	4.27
4449	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	Super dark tan head with big globs of lacing. The aroma is full of maple and smoke. Nice light sweetness, big roasted malts, smoke, maple and a pinch of salt. Really great beer.	4.5
4450	Maple Bacon Coffee Porter	L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick texture. There was a half inch of foamy, tan-colored head that lasted an average amount of time. Not much lacing, though.. S: A very nice aroma of maple syrup, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and toffee.. T: Tasted of a moderate amount of chocolate, a bit of coffee (could have used more), some roasted malt notes, a good shot of maple syrup, a tinge of toffee, and light hops. No real trace of the advertised bacon. The flavor isn't quite as robust as the aroma would lead you to believe, but it is pretty tasty. Gets better as you go along..  806 characters	4.1
4451	Aurelian Lure	Hazy pale color, almost no head. Aroma has fresh, unripe fruits like apricot, quince and mirabelles. Also quite spicy with some saffron and curry. Taste is tart and fruity with unripe apricot complete with skin. Really mineral on the finish. Light body, medium carbonation, really dry. A great, refreshing and really elegant sour.	4.6
4452	Aurelian Lure	one of the jester king beers that i have been unable to track down until now, highly acclaimed and on my list forever, stoked to finally have sourced it. its definitely one of the best apricot wild beers in the game, so intense and so natural at the same time, in a lot of ways reminds me of when i tried cascade apricot for the first time, and just realized that there was no more true expression of apricots in beer than that, this is the same, but much less sour, and with the classic jester king funky yeast mix that makes their beers so distinctive all the time. a pulpy orange hazy look to this one, under a short but lasting white head. the nose is incredible, the best feature of this for me and where i really appreciate the apricots most, fuzzy and real, fleshy and juicy and sweet and ripe, their absolute essence. some higher level bacterial acidity evident here too, but all in service of the fruit. nice oak to the flavor, gives it a richness, and a light wine and vanilla thing in the flavor, beautiful with the pale wheat malt and the sugars in the fruit, its funky and sour and also kind of desserty, a little more left at the end of this one than in a lot of their beers, especially these small bottle fruited releases, and i love how long it lingers. more sour than others too, especially at temperature, but it all works so well together. epic expression of apricots in a really amazingly funky and mature wild beer, up there with the best of jester king, and certainly worth all the hype!	4.52
4453	Aurelian Lure	Blend 4.. I'm continually amazed by how much fruit falls off of sours when aged for some time. I recently enjoyed a Fen Tao and the peach notes were tremendous. Since then, I've drank a Nocturn Chrysalis and an Aurelian Lure - neither have had a comparable presence of fruit, after two years of aging. I'm surprised, for some reason. All beers age differently, but it seems consistent that fruit notes fall off a bit.. Aurelian Lure thus doesn't have much apricot presence left. It's dominated now by sour, tart barrel notes. It's also very acidic. Damn sour, damn tart, and very good - but my acidic reflux was unpleasant after this beer. Be prepared accordingly.	4.5
4454	Aurelian Lure	One of my all time favorites from JK. I have had each batch and while the most recent batch was not as good as ones in the past it is still one of the best sours they make.	4.79
4455	Aurelian Lure	Very nice apricot sour. Pours a golden color with subtle apricot notes. Tart on the tongue, but dry and subtle apricot notes become subtle apricot flavor on the palate. Great brew that I hope to have again	4.09
4456	Aurelian Lure	I had this at the release on tap, along side Fen Tao, and later in the bottle. I have to say, on tap was better which is like saying the sky is blue. In my opinion, apricot is one of the best fruits to go with sour beers and this is definitely one of the better sours JK makes. Deep apricot flavor, medium sourness, all deliciousness.	4.54
4457	Aurelian Lure	2017 vintage (blend 5).. A: Pours a very light straw color with a thin ring of very fine, bright white head. Nicely effervescent. Good retention for the minimal head that’s there. Decent good clarity.. S: Hay, honey, apricot, light barnyard funk. Delicate..  799 characters	4.15
4458	Aurelian Lure	"Batch 2 poured into a tulip.. Poured semi hazy, minimal head. Golden orange in color.
Aroma was all stone fruit and some lacto. Smelled amazing.
Tasted so good. B2 held up well. Lots of fruit balanced by some nice sourness. Not overly puckering.
Feel was as expected. Light with good carb. Didn't strip the enamel from my teeth.
Overall, this was an outstanding sour. JK just does sours right and this was no exception."	4.5
4459	Aurelian Lure	Hit of what I'm coming to understand is trademark JK funk, which is to say a little outhouse-y for me, but that settles down over time. On the palate, some light nectary apricot and a robust acidity that causes some throat burn by the end of the glass. A solid sour but nothing worth going out of your way for.	4.07
4460	Aurelian Lure	Blend 3 august 2015. Golden burnt orange. White head.. Huge sour and tartness with a big apricot fruit flavor. It has a nice funk and very barnyardy. Definitely tastes like JK funk. Lemon acidity..  242 characters	4.35
4461	Aurelian Lure	This was incredibly delicious. I was hoping for something special as I was told it was great. But this blew me away. This was a phenomenal beer on a hot summer day. I hope I can find more...	4.73
4462	Aurelian Lure	Pours gold. There's some pepper like particulate in the bottom of my glass.I'm not getting that much aroma. May be some jasmine. This beer is super dry with some juicy apricot flavors. I'm not getting a ton of sweetness.	4.22
4463	Aurelian Lure	Had this alongside an O'so Arbre Qui Donne (which, just as personal preference, I liked slightly better). Hazy orange-yellow color with very little head. Aroma was very funky, with the apricot complementing nicely. The taste was tart and crisp, with the best way I can describe it as 'funky fresh.' The apricots were there, but the funky and tart, slightly puckering mouthfeel that finished not as dry as expected are what make the beer special.	4.34
4464	Aurelian Lure	One of my few perfect 5's. Better than Fou' Foune methinks. The scent is unreal. I kept sniffing and sniffing. The beer is sour but not an acid bomb. The interplay with the apricots is fantastic. Apricot is probably my favorite fruit in any sour. Truly a beer worth seeking out.	5
4465	Aurelian Lure	"A: Cloudy, dark yellow with no head
S: Sweet apricot, peach, funk, nectarine, tart, lemon, vinous
T: Balanced tartness, sweet apricot, peach, lightly lactic, hint of funk, lemon, oak tannin
M: Delicate carbonation but not up to the fantastic level that I love from JK. Dry
O: Apricot seems like a fruit that blends very well with the wild ale base. Great balance as always from Jester King."	4.31
4466	Aurelian Lure	Shared with JLindros.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice lightly hazy golden hue with a thin white head that fades to leave light wisps.. S - Aromas of juicy, musty apricots. Loads and loads of fruit here great stone fruits. Fragrant and floral. Very nice bright apricots..  584 characters	4.36
4467	Aurelian Lure	Another big thanks to rudzud.. Pretty Much no head, well light bubbles, little lacing, very hazy candy orange color.. Nose big stone fruit, peach apricot like, big apricot, little tart but nice juicy fruit, little tangy acidic..  598 characters	4.27
4468	Aurelian Lure	Hazy orange body with a bubbly white head. Aromas of oak, vanilla, stone fruit. The apricot character is not especially assertive. While the beer is certainly tasty, it's less extraordinary than I hoped / expected. Lightly sweet, mild to medium tartness and a subtle acetic quality in the finish. Good stuff.	4.1
4469	Aurelian Lure	Shared with a few non-craft friends.. Everyone might have just turned the table on appreciation of sour beers. Everyone was telling me what they tasted before I could intrude with my insight. They were all spot on! Some were not sure if they enjoyed it, but all were glad they tried it. One of the softest beers I have ever had. Perfect fruit presence, with more lingering in the finish than up front.	4.69
4470	Aurelian Lure	It's amazing to me how much more attention these fruited beers get. This is a fine liquid, but some of their standard stuff has so much more to offer on flavor, aroma, complexity, and mouthfeel.. This is very champagne-like, and while I don't have a lot of experience reviewing champagnes, it has a dry bubbly effervescence, with some sweet tang in there as well.. All the flavors marry to the point that it becomes one golden royal potion where nothing really stands out and says apricot, but it's there, in peach, pear, apple and even white grape expressions. The sourness is mildly oaky, tingly and faintly sharp on the swallow--it's so well developed that it really could be put up against some of the best France has to offer, but, what would I know in that regard. I rate beers..  961 characters	4.2
4471	Aurelian Lure	Slightly opaque golden yellow with 2 fingers of course chalky white head. Fruit is very apparent on the nose along with some back ground funk. Taste is dominated by minerality but the apricot is apparent on the back. Moderately sour that works extremely well with the fruit. Very clean finish.	4.31
4472	Aurelian Lure	Poured from the 500 mL into a snifter.. Fizzy pale white head (it gushed when I popped it) over a peach skin color. Some residue but beautiful. 4.75. Tart orchard fruit and earthiness. Some sort of unripe peach or apricot. The fruit is robust. 4.25.  546 characters	4.46
4473	Aurelian Lure	Draught at Jester King. Pours a hazy bright golden color with not much head. Funk, apricots, wholly apricots Batman, and some tartness on the nose; follows onto the palate. Light bodied. Finishes tart and dry with plenty of lingering apricot fruit.	4.5
4474	Aurelian Lure	(From a 4 oz. tasting of batch 3.) Cloudy but representative apricot color, and the fruit comes through on the nose in a nice reserved way, and then the taste stays right in step with the pace and expectation of the lead-in. I'm not a fan of sours and citrus-forward beers, so this sweeter fruit theme is more to my liking and is a beautiful offering for the type.	4.49
4475	Aurelian Lure	Had batch 3 fresh at JK at the release party and I think this was the best batch yet. So much sourness and nice notes of apricot on the nose and throughout the entire drink. The carbonation is perfect and the flavor is so complex.	4.54
4476	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	honestly this beer is tough to beat. I'll try new beers all the time thinking they're great and then i'll pick up some fuzzy baby ducks and it just mops the floor with them. Great beer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	5
4477	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	2-month-old can poured into a tulip. Has to be said: absolutely awesome can art.. Murky but pretty dark-orange-gold body with borderline-turbid haze. Huge, fluffy head of tightly compact off-white bubbles. Excellent retention and remarkable lacing.. Based on the ultra-high ratings for this beer, I'm guessing that the age on the can I'm drinking has taken a lot away from the aromas and flavors. But I have to base my ratings on what I'm actually consuming, and in that respect this is a solid but fairly average hazy IPA..  1,294 characters	3.59
4478	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can of this. Something I remember trying to get when it first came out but those Connecticut haze boys value this thing on whale tier level.. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy murky deep orange hue with a fat two finger white head that fades slowly to leave loads of creamy lacing and a dense creamy blanket.. S - Aromas of bright juicy citrus and peel, decent amount of candied mango and tropical fruit. Flashes of dried fruit as well, tropical fruit leather. Good lighter malt sweetness..  1,016 characters	4.32
4479	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	"Been trying to get this for years...just happened to be driving by the brewery and checked, and they had it! BAM! Love the label, but wish I could remove it easily. Canned 8/09/19
Pours a huge frothy foamy slight creamy medium bubble head with good retention, soapy lacing, hazy deep orange with a little dark reddish tint. Nose brings loads of citrus, juicy orange, tangerine, orange cream notes, with a mild fluffy creamy malt base, little doughy, then tropical with light mango, papaya, and something else I can't label.  1,468 characters"	4.39
4480	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	12oz. can served in a nonic. Canned 7/2/19. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head. Nose is fairly subdued - subtle aromas of citrus, pith and biscuity malt with perhaps a kiss of tropical fruit at the back. Taste consistent with nose, albeit brighter and the tropical fruits notes are more pronounced towards the middle and a hint of herbal/medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel if light-medium, with an easy, even carbonation. Overall, tasty and quit edrinkable.	3.97
4481	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	"On tap at the brewery
Hazy gold, three fingers of fine white head, full curtain, cap
Orange, grapefruit, lemon, light floral, grapefruit aromas
Light bitter hop flavors of orange,bitter pineapple, apricot, light pine
Smooth, light medium mouthfeel, dry finish with bitter aftertaste, no alcohol
Strong stubborn carbonation
Full bodied and full flavored
Great IPA"	4.39
4482	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	I have not drunk many beers over the last few weeks life has been topsy turvy. I am so ready to get off this roller coaster. Fuzzy duck, like the name of this beer, the can art is awesome. The beer is 45 degrees and served in a pint glass. The head retention is excellent. The beer's head produced a two finger thick frothy, creamy and airy. The head left lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold color with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is hazy. Overall the beer has a beautiful appearance.. The aromas in the beer are bright citrus ( oranges, mandarins, lemons, and grapefruit), toasted malts, biscuits, honey-like sweetness, a touch of herbal, a touch of floral, and a hint of grass.. The flavors in the beer are bright oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruit, toasted malts, biscuits, honey-like sweetness, a touch of herbal, grass, bready, and a hint of pine..  1,155 characters	4.41
4483	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Canned on 5/24/19. Pours a slightly cloudy golden dark orange body topped with a fluffy, tightly composed white head; excellent retention recedes evenly to a thick cap and uniform tapestry of lacing.. Aromas burst with deeply juicy resinous tones of pineapple, papaya, and tropical zest; a beautiful honeyed orange highlights the bouquet upfront; occasionally dense bready spice and corn flakes pop on the backbone to support the deep citrusy sweetness with a deft herbal touch that defines the aroma..  1,409 characters	4.38
4484	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Traded for this a while ago, as there wasn't a date on the bottom of the can. Wasn't sure what to expect out of this as the beer was quite old when I finally cracked it open, and although it wasn't bad, I don't see how it earned the lofty rating that it had on here.... The pour to this was alright as the liquid had a orange blossom hue to it with plenty of white, bubbly head to top it off. Most of the thin lacing was around the top of my pint glass with a few scattered splotches below it. Lots of citrus juice and rind in the nose with some dank, tropical notes and pine as well. It wasn't bad but at this point, I've had so many beers with those notes that this seemed like something else I've had before but couldn't quite remember exactly what. That characteristic was true for the taste as well given how slick, sweet, and somewhat heavy this was but once again, it wasn't anything noteworthy or outstanding to me, as the malt was certainly there but not anything that added or detracted to this beer's flavor profile.... The amount of alcohol in this was typical as well with just enough to give this some heft but not enough to easily felt or detected. A date on the bottom of the can might have helped but as it was, I would love to give this another go with something fresher. A mild, dry hop burn took hold as I finished this off and there was just a little bit of sediment at the bottom of the liquid but as it was, this was a beer that was as prototypical as a New Englad IPA could get...	4
4485	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Pours a true hazy orange with two fingers of khaki foam after an eager pour. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, guava, pillowy yeast and clove. Tropical fruits are pronounced and sugary. Flavor profile carries more of the same qualities, with papaya, orange, mango, tangerine and guava sitting on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Light notes of yeast, and bready malts round out the flavor profile, but the balance is still very clearly tipped towards hops. Mouth feel is pillowy and creamy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet, but overly so. It clearly focuses on tropical fruits, but refrains from becoming cloyingly sweet - a refreshing NE IPA characteristic.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 12oz can.	4.28
4486	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	From a can, direct from the brewery. First impression was “this is no single ipa”. Tastes heavy to me, lush and potent. Bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable. good amount of bitter lingering... more than I expected. Finishes drier than I expected. There is a strong mineral character, an almost metallic tingle which, for me, takes over too much of the flavor. Here i was thinking this was a juicy neipa but Citra commonalities aside, this is a different animal. Im hoping it grows on me but it feels a bit “one note”. Im not blown away. Im maybe not as “citra-centric” as others so I shouldn’t be surprised that im not gaga over this. I see why people like it but... seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer. My issue is that it starts exactly where it ends, it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus... like your tongue is being zapped, but there isnt a depth to the experience... or a nuance to the hop profile... Again, one note. I normally really like single hop ipas but i think ive learned that citra does not have what im looking for, at least not when all by itself. All that said, it is excellent beer.	4.11
4487	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	"Poured out of a can into a tree house pint glass
Nose is tropical but not super intense.
Body has a NE style haze but not super dense like some of the juice bombs.
Flavor follows nose.
Nothing super intense. Definitely tastes more like a “beet” on the back end than a lot of these other hazies out there.
Overall very good but missing some of the density."	4.19
4488	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	An exceptional IPA that stands out above a sea full of IPAs. Love getting my hands on this beer. Love me some fuzzy baby ducks! This is a beer everyone needs to try at some point.	4.38
4489	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Really excellent IPA. Finally got my hands on some fresh cans this weekend. Opaque pale orange with a lacy white head. Strong aromas of papaya and a whole range of citrus, especially orange. Medium bodied, smooth textured, and pleasantly dry throughout. Lighter and more refreshing, though less complex, than their DIPAs. Of course that's by design. NEBCO's got the winning recipes.	4.5
4490	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	12oz. can into a Fuzzy sensory glass.. Hazy, like a New England IPA... though not quite as hazy. Nose reveals its not quite that though. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, pine and fresh cut grass. A swirl gives additional notes of cantaloupe and pungent hop bitterness. A classic smell. Beer opens citrus, papaya and pineapple with hints of grass, pine and a fresh hop bitterness in the back. Finally! Some BALANCE between the tropical fruit notes and a nice, biting hop bitterness. Finishes cane sugar and grapefruit with a distinct hop film in the aftertaste. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Prickly and foamy in the mouth and goes down soft with a dry and filmy aftertaste. Super drinkable.. It's impressive when a single IPA can pack this much flavor. It's even more impressive when that flavor comes with great balance. This is a classic for sure and holds its own as a pre-cursor to the hazy IPA style.	4.38
4491	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Golden orange yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Citrus zest, nectarine and mango. Biscuit malt profile. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Lower in carb. Balanced with all flavors melding together. Not really bursting with flavor, but it's nice. Don't really get the super hype on this one. Maybe the balanced nature of it actually elevates it.	4.13
4492	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	"""Merry Quackmas"" -- canned 12/19/17. Finally!!! Got my hands on some Fuzzy Baby Ducks. Wanna thank the bartenders at NEBCo. for finding a can under the bar and giving me an early Christmas gift. Gorgeous cloudy golden liquid, huge tropical fruit nose. Flavor and feel are lusciously smooth with creamy Citra amazingness. Just awesome stuff. Exceeds the hype from the first sip. Sublime drinkability...this is fizzy, alcoholic mango juice."	4.84
4493	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Look: Translucent straw gold with slight haze and a moderate white head. Light activity.. Smell: Grassy hops with a hint of peach. Light honey malt.. Taste: Hop notes if ripe lychee, peach skin, honeydew, and fresh cut grass. Cracker thin malt..  533 characters	4.39
4494	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	On tap at New England brewing company. Poured into a glass , hazy yellow , white foam ring , good lacings. Slight citrus aroma.  212 characters	4.14
4495	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	A 12 fl oz can with no canned on or best before date on it. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.. Appearance: A hazy orange colour with a nice two finger white head that had decent retention and left nice lacing.. Aroma: Orange, mandarin, citrus rind, ripe mango, pineapple and grapefruit..  715 characters	4.71
4496	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Cloudy amber appearance with nice head that desipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of citrus. Taste is more of a balanced hoppy citrus with some bitterness.	4.44
4497	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Look: Amber Golden color. See a little bit of light through it. Fluffy one in a half fingers off of white head.. Smell: Citrus Fruit orange, tangerine. Biscuitsy, Grainy malt sweetness. Grapefruit peel, pine. Some floral notes. It's smells balanced.. Taste: It follows the nose pretty much to a tee. Upfront your greeted with those citrus fruit notes. Orange, tangerine. Not overly juicy almost leaning toward citrus peel which carries over to the mid palate where you also get those biscuity, grainy maltiness. it's not overly sweet malts. The malt adds a nice balance to the hops. In the finish is where you get the hoppy bitterness. You get that grapefruit rind, piney bitterness along with some floral, herbal hoppiness that sticks to the sides of your tongue..  1,398 characters	4
4498	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Huge shoutout to my NY connection for getting access to this gem!. This pours a great murky gold, entirely opaque. Really nice frothy head of foam that retains the lace well.. Undoubtedly citra hops here. The beautiful balanced aromas of citrus and pine work great to start this beer off on the nose. The lingering bitterness on the back keeps you coming back for more..  1,125 characters	4.74
4499	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	Pours burnt Amber. Nice white head. Citrus on the nose. Taste is citrus, orange peels and candied orange. Really tasty. Has a piney finish. Look forward to more from them.	4.53
4500	Fuzzy Baby Ducks	The body appears turbid with an amber orb in the center and gold around the edges topped by a large, off-white foam that slowly settles with a fuzzy cling.. Smell is orange zest all over, but also sharp New England-style IPA yeast that is very prominent, even from afar. It really reminds me of Trillium, and almost verges into Belgian territory, but mainly keeps with the faint apple cider vinegar profile. There is also a surprising level of bready malt that translates as buttery biscuit, with a little floral and herbal potpourri perfume that sticks to the glass.. Taste is sweeter and breadier than I imagined due to its hype level, with a complete orange presence--rind, zest, flesh, juice, and even candy. It also finishes with more pine than I expected as well..  954 characters	3.88
4501	La Fosse	I had this right after having Fuzzy at the tasting room in St. Louis and they are neck and neck. I may actually prefer La Fosse, because the apricots have a more unique aroma and tartness that set it apart from Fuzzy more significantly than anticipated.	4.83
4502	La Fosse	Slightly hazy unpolished gold with a fizzy white blanket settling to a thin spotty film.. Having this side by side with Smooth, this is more sour, sharp and sweet, and also slightly firmer of body with a crisp fizz. The oak is almost vinegary in the swallow, and oh yeah, it's acetic. Funk and oak are less present here, but there's still a complexity of oak. However, it's less wine-like and more neutral. There are hints of yellow apple, mango and biscuit, but it's just way too acidic.	3.94
4503	La Fosse	Had poured on-site at side project cellar from a 375ml bottle. Wow is it spectacular with a tart punch to the face that finishes smooth from the apricot. Very delightful mouth feel that makes this perfect for a summer day	4.68
4504	La Fosse	Blend #3.. A: Pours a fizzy, light pale orange color with basically no head.. S: Fresh apricot, moderate and well-integrated barnyard, and a bit of pepper and vanilla..  446 characters	4.42
4505	La Fosse	Finally got to rate this beer. B3 from bottle to glass, pours an opaque orange hue, a lot like the juice. Very fruity on the nose. The flavor profile to me is very similar to Fuzzy(I guess I should have an actual peach and apricot side by side to really know the difference), which in the end is why I am rating it the same. Beautiful beer, that I think Side Project has improved over previous batches, as the acidity levels have gone down quite significantly in my opinion.	4.45
4506	La Fosse	"L: Bold tangerine and dark orange hues with a thin wispy white head that recedes quickly
S: Ripe juicy apricot with a complement of other citrus and stone fruits and slight hay funk
T: Healthy shot of tart grapefruit followed by a burst of muddled peaches; the finish is a robust funky apricot note that lingers
F: Medium bodied with light carb; rich and jammy
O: For a four-year-old bottle of blend #1 this has held up surprisingly well. The carb and head have fallen off slightly, but what's left is a concentrated wild apricot jammy experience. Another incredible fruited sour by one of the best in the game - well done."	4.59
4507	La Fosse	Batch 2 bottle poured into a Side Project wine glass.. Pours a super pulpy, bright, glowing orange body with a frothy white head that leaves nice lacing and retention. Beautiful looking beer.. On the nose are heavy, potent apricot aromas, like a freshly sliced apricot. Bright and fresh, grassy, hay, with a sharp acidity and citrus aromas..  644 characters	4.77
4508	La Fosse	Blend 2, consumed onsite at Side Project. Juicy apricots with a touch of oak and the signature Side Project yeast/sourness. Looks and smells incredible...very nicely done!	4.73
4509	La Fosse	i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy, which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour, this beer seems way more acidic to me, but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity, i really dont know. either way, this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date. pale hazy lambic looking beer, with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast. the aroma is the best part for me, woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base, it is lambic at its core it seems, but the fruit is so vibrant here, soft super ripe apricots, their absolute essence, intense and amazingly enticing. sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers, depending on how they are used, but there is no mistaking these apricots! so true to the real fruit, in its best form. the flavor is like that too, with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor (and wood) on the front end, and all the fruit showing up later on. i like the progression of flavors moving this way, the fruit lingers long in the finish, but the beer is very dry. its a step more sour than it needs to be i think, it sort of hurts the teeth like that, has an overdeveloped bacterial sting, and sits litle vinegary in the belly. still nice bretty notes about, as fruity as the apricots themselves. great carbonation and a very light body. a very special beer, and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states.... edit: just had a blend three from awhile ago now, and it was exceedingly sour, way past the point where i would want to drink even this little bottle by myself, its got a nail polish remover thing going on, and really is overly intense in that regard. i like the apricot still, and i like the flavor overall, lemony and natural, the fruit has held up well. unfortunately, this is another beer from these guys that is just way too sour at this point, they have all been trending in that direction, but its too much now. i liked it much better when it was fresh.	4.39
4510	La Fosse	"batch 2 drank at side project on 3/28/2016. this is overall a fantastic beer. this is a phenomenal showcase of an apricot fruited wild ale. it is a tad on the ""too sour"" side, but that is only if i have to nitpick this. really a beautiful beer and one I am glad to have tried. wonderful levels of oak, apricot, some other citrus notes, and acid. lovely beer"	4.58
4511	La Fosse	Batch2 from the bottle release today. Look is opaque light orange. Smell is light funk at first, eggy, then heavy apricots as it warms. Taste is amazing. Sour then apricots all over the place. More apricots as it warms up. Dry finish. Wife and I have had almost all of the fruited sours and this is by far the best we've ever had from Side Project. They really hit the nail on the head with this one. This beer explodes apricots all over the place. Really really tasty.	4.75
4512	La Fosse	Had at CBC 2016. I love sour beers, and there were some great ones there. This one was simply too much though; everything that would probably make this beer great as well gets overshadowed by the extreme sourness. Without a doubt the most sour beer I've ever had. As a bit of a novelty , definitely worth trying. But man, my teeth hated me after this one.	3.83
4513	La Fosse	"A: Rich golden orange but has no head or carb to speak of
S: lots of ripe apricot with an intense acetic smell, you can tell this is going to be sour
T: apricot, funk, cottage cheese, yogurt, highly lacto and acidic
M: very dry but doesn't feel undercarbed
O: the apricots are here but overcome bu the enamel ripping sourness and acidity. My gut will be feeling this one in the morning."	3.87
4514	La Fosse	First SP fruited beer. La Fosse is fine, pretty good even, but it suffers from the overwhelming amount of acidity (reminded me of Upland). I definitely don't think it's worth what it trades for. If you want Apricots, I think nearly every other similar beer is much better (Aurelian Lure, Apricot Bu, Apricot Fruit Stand, Fou Foune, West Ashley, etc).	4.25
4515	La Fosse	This is straight battery acid. Batch one and batch two are just straight acid. Batch one was even more so than batch two. This is easily the worst side project beer I've had to date. This will be a preference thing though. Both of my friends liked it while I poured the rest of mine in their glasses	3.24
4516	La Fosse	This beer definitely has apricot in it. The smell is there and the taste is there along with some punch you in the face sourness. This beer is very acidic and funky and plays well with the fruit. Did a side by side with Map of the Sun and de Garde's Imperial Apricot and this came in 2nd to DG, Map came in a distant 3rd.	4.11
4517	La Fosse	The beer pours a golden yellow with minimal head.. The nose is like a funky apricot pureed.. The taste is a very sour apricot and vinegar blast with a heavy touch of wet hay funk..  618 characters	4.5
4518	La Fosse	375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Very hazy orange body. Small white head. Strong apricot aroma. Oak. White wine. And immediately the taste is incredibly sour. The sourest apricots I can imagine. Overwhelming. Really great apricot flavor, but it just gets so sour. Just a bit of oak and white wine remain. Low carbonation. It’s good, but so sour. Completely covers up anything else going on.	3.34
4519	La Fosse	Lots of apricot with a moderate funk to the aroma. Sweet apricots mix with funky and musty sourness in the taste. A little sharp in the finish. Excellent overall.	4.46
4520	La Fosse	The beer is an orange juice gold color. Smallish white head. Very cloudy. Head dissipates quickly. The aroma is big on apricots. Pretty good lacto note. Not much funk. Quite a nice juicy fruit aroma. The taste is very sour. You get some nice fruit but the acidity is just too aggressive for me. There seems to be a nice beer hidden underneath that monster sour kick, and it's a real shame that you can't really taste it well. Some oak - a bit of a buttery white wine flavor - and apricots come through, but both are well in the background. Mostly lacto sourness, mostly just tastes like neutral acidity. Big pucker. Lots of back of the throat sour, phlegmy feeling in the finish. Fairly light body. As I wrote before, there's a good beer in there, but it's so sour that you lose complexity and depth of flavor.	3.52
4521	La Fosse	"Pours a fantastic golden yellow, similar to the color on the label. Nose is full of sour and some peachy fruitiness gently in the background.
The sour comes at you hard upon first taste, overtaking your palate. Thankfully loads of apricots follow up the sourness and blend nicely. The feel is thicker then I was expecting and it was necessary to offset the sour. Really nice and long finish."	4.47
4522	La Fosse	Imcredible beer. Only had a small 3 oz sample at the FWIBF into a 6 oz snifter. The stone fruit shines and is comimented nicely with the puckering sour of the lactic acid. For a Side Project, these brews continue to take on starring roles!	4.99
4523	La Fosse	A. Cloudy golden orange in color. Thin ring of white foam and minimal lacing.. S. Juicy apricots and some lactic acid on the nose. Not much funk here - just fruit. It smells really good. T. Tasty follows the nose; apricots and lactic acid. The first few sips were almost overwhelming with the amount of acidity / sour on my pallet. As it warmed the fruit came out more. The flavor lingers in your mouth for quite awhile after taking a sip. Not much funk or complexity - just sour and fruit.  862 characters	4.56
4524	La Fosse	Undrinkable due to the acidity. Had higher hopes for this one but it was a drain pour for me. Maybe a bad bottle, but see others with similar comments.	3.41
4525	La Fosse	Bottle at side project.. White head. Golden sunset orange.. This beer is very sour and tart. Still refreshing. Nice carbobation level. The apricot flavor is massive and dominate. Very fruity and fresh. Lemon acdity..  279 characters	4.53
4526	DFPF	"On tap at Fidelity festival, Dublin.
Lurid fuschia; summer berry + cream nose; big fruit, herbal undertones, smooth lactic base; crisp.. 4.25 4 4.5 4.25 4.5. Fruit is *so* present but not harsh. No hint of 6%. Hangs together beautifully: picture of a lacto sour. I could stay on this all day. I get the fuss about them now."	4.34
4527	DFPF	"On tap at Lyon Bière Festival #4 off nights in La Crafterie.. Amazing purple colour.
The fruits are pungent. You get the best of both dragon fruit sweetness and passion fruit tartness.. The whole thing is perfectly balanced. That's the most import thing. The sourness is amazing, the mouthfeel is soft and velvety.
Nearly perfect berliner weisse.
The best one I've had to date"	4.88
4528	DFPF	Bottled February 2016; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Neon purple appearance.. No head; no lace..  342 characters	4.24
4529	DFPF	On tap at Brewskival 2018.. Pours a luminous cherry red color, with very little head.. Smell is tart, with notes of cherries, passionfruit, lime and pomegranate. Lots of levels here..  458 characters	4.42
4530	DFPF	Large bottle ...$25 at Other Half in Bklyn. Pours a bright and crazy shade of magenta...minimal to no head. Fruity n sweet nose.  199 characters	3.92
4531	DFPF	Tasted from bottle. Pours a bright ruby red with pink head. Nice fruit aroma. Berries and passionfruit nose. Taste is super tart with sweet fruity flavors. Don’t remember what dragonfruit tastes like. I get lots of berries, strawberries, with some tropical fruit notes. I’m not a huge Berliner or sour fan but this is very nice.	4.12
4532	DFPF	Poured from a bomber into a taster. Thanks Ryan for sharing.. Pours a magnificent neon pink body with a bright pink head. Brightest, most unique looking beer I've ever witnessed. Wow.. Taste and aromas align.. Straight passion fruit, candy-like fruity tartness.. Hawaiian warheads if that existed . grassy, earthy, lactic and citrus tartness, pulpy. Drinks like fruit juice.	4.54
4533	DFPF	What?!? Have you seen what this stuff looks like?? Bright fuchsia liquid glowing in my glass. Absolutely astonishing to look at. Nose is all passion fruit...smells amazing. Taste is also all passion fruit with some perfect tartness to finish. Feel is excellent and dry. Overall, this is an amazing berliner and hands down, the most insane looking beer I've ever seen.	4.85
4534	DFPF	"Pours beautiful pink/ruby with white reddish head.
Aroma has sweet red berries, sour, funk, pineapple.
Taste is red berries, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, peach, lemon, sour, funk."	4.75
4535	DFPF	Pouring a blend of ruby jewels, pink and neon purple, with a thin, very pale purple foam, I'm also seeing red, figuratively, at the prospect of being toyed with by JWB again, ala Troll So Hard and Haterade.. However, right away, the old lady says this smells like Hawaii. She should know, having just returned. Passion fruit, dragon fruit and pear pop all over the nose, with Sweet Tarts and mango dashed in.. Taste is really tart with a little funk, where the passion fruit and dragon fruit come through surprisingly well. I also get some sour apple and a hint of lemon..  1,161 characters	4.29
4536	DFPF	Wow, beautiful pour!! And nice sticky persistent bold fuscia head. Dragon and passion fruit infiltrate your passages on this one, but done in a way that sticks to the category, awesome! Must try!!	4.52
4537	DFPF	2016 (batch 1) drank on 2/4/2017. L-bright reddish pink with a big head that disappears quickly. This is a beautiful beer.. S-sour, acidic, passion fruit, tropical.  388 characters	4.44
4538	DFPF	Bottle: Poured a copper/pink color beer with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of raspberry vinegar with some ripe mango notes is quite unique. Taste is also a mix of ripe fruit notes with some mango and other tropical fruit notes with some tart and raspberry vinegar notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Unique take on the style and something I wish I could drink again.	4.38
4539	DFPF	Just gorgeous to look at - I almost didn't want to drink it. Like Miami Madness, it has a crazy low abv, so you can sip it all day long by the pool. DFPF >MM btw.	4.41
4540	DFPF	now this is what i am talking about! this is how you use tropical fruit in a sour beer! splendid stuff, gives me a new respect for the brewery, and despite how the hype train rolls, i would drink this over their highly acclaimed maimi madness any day! brilliant fuschia pink color, not a ton of head, but electric, like some of the intense hibiscus beers out there, looks almost unnatural from the dragon fruit, but the aroma and flavor of both fruits is incredibly authentic. super fruit forward, the natural tartness of the passion fruit is a perfect addition to the already quite acidic and sour base beer, clean lemony lacto allowed to really develop. perfect ph for the fruit i think, max flavor extraction, a touch of sweetness, but i can still taste the wheat underneath it all. good carbonation, dramatic fruit flavors, just short of perfumey intense, concentrated, not for everyone i am sure. i loved how the fruits go together so well, and together with the sourness, awesome how low alcohol it is too! this is sensational beer that deserves the high praise it is receiving! nothing else like this exists to my knowledge. without question the best beer with dragon fruit i have ever had!	4.48
4541	DFPF	This might be my favorite Berliner of all time. I managed to get 5 pours of this at GABF last weekend, and I would have gotten more if I had more time. This is insanely sour, fruity, and perfectly carbed.	4.78
4542	DFPF	Bottle shared by Daniel. Thank you!. Bright pink body with a thin, off-white collar that fades immediately to nil. Aromas of passion fruit, guava. Grandiose fruit character leaps out in the aroma. Tart, hard candies of assorted tropical fruit. Absolutely delicious.	4.71
4543	DFPF	"**REVIEW NUMBER 900**
:and also:
**BEER ADVOCATE BEER NUMBER 1,500**. Reviewed from notes. Poured from 750 mL bottle into a Cigar City Hunahpu's Day large snifter glass.. A: Dark pink to red, with a two finger bright pink head that fades fairly quickly. A good amount of visible carbonation and moderate haziness..  1,072 characters"	4.56
4544	DFPF	Had been saving this one to share with a friend for quite some time and we finally had the time to get together and drink it! This one did not disappoint! Deep purple hue and mountains of fruit!! Probably the best Berliner I've ever had! Amazing stuff!!!	4.77
4545	DFPF	Bottle pour into a taster. Gorgeous beer! Huge, huge, huge tropical fruit, particularly passion fruit. One of the best berliners I've had a chance to try.	4.66
4546	DFPF	The most beautiful purple pink I have ever seen. It looks like juice. Sparking with color. Rhubarb hue to it. Wow.. So much fruit juice. It's so tropical. Nice tartness. Very faint funk.. Light bodied. Ends clean. Refreshing..  288 characters	4.53
4547	DFPF	"The color, deep rich magenta, and the nose, total passion fruit bomb, were absolutely amazing! Taste was basically passion fruit juice without any detectable ""beer-ness"" other than carbonation, which left me somewhat undecided as part of me thinks a beer should taste a little like beer. That said, the usually enamel ripping sourness of de Garde Bu way down and you get JWB berliner, which to me sets THE high bar for all others."	4.55
4548	DFPF	Amazing color to this beer. Lighter purple color. Great flavor. Lots of passion fruit. Just a touch of tartness. In general, this is not my preferred style of beer, but this was great.	4.5
4549	DFPF	Pours a magenta pink red color. Aroma is tart with a light sweetness. Flavor is really nice. It's tart but still light and refreshing. Has some citrus tropical fruit notes and overall is a really nice drinking experience.	4.38
4550	DFPF	It looks like a magenta highlighter. The head is just a shade lighter purple/pink. The dragonfruit is the color, but the passionfruit is the star of the show. The nose and taste are all passionfruit with a perfect light tartness. Quenching, fruity, and delicious.	4.71
4551	Sosus	"This was one of my many purchases from Tavour before we parted CANpony. I hold no animosity towards them, it was just that their local shipping company was as flexible as an I-beam & I grew tired of arguing with their dispatcher. Tavour apparently has/had a CANtract with them so they could not offer any relief. Oh well. Today is TGBC Day @ Chez Woody!. From the Bottle: ""We named this IPA after the Greek mosaic artist[,] Sosus of Pergamons[,] because we were inspired to create a beer that tastes like a masterpiece. This single-hop IPA showcases the irresistible tropical fruit flavors of the Mosaic hop, shining a light on the power of simplicity."". I Pop!ped the cap & began a slow, gentle C-Line pour since there were some obvious lees on the kick/punt & I saw no reason to rouse them. It formed two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, French Vanilla-colored head with good retention on its own. Color was a deeply-hazy/lightly-cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose was less sweet than in the previous, fresher Pompeii BUT (& yinz anti-AIPA aging types are going to hate me for saying so), it smelled like a pineapple upside-down cake, which I prefer to a tropical fruit salad. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste had a slight tang to it, not at all sweet, with a pronounced pineapple flavor. Mmm. Lovely! Finish was semi-dry, but I was happy not to have to deal with a fruity onslaught so it all worked out..  1,491 characters"	4.09
4552	Sosus	Bottled 11/11/15; drank 11/21/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus.. See-through orange appearance.. Minimal bright white head; nice lace..  325 characters	3.75
4553	Sosus	Wow, pours a cloudy golden haze topped by a silky white head that makes way for sticky lacing. Tonnes of sediment swirling around from top to bottom. A beautiful sight. Tropical fruit hops on the nose. Big, bold flavors of pineapple and orange envelop your whole head as you dive in. Extremely sessionable for a heavyweight. I simply cannot take the glass away more than an inch from my face. When I'm not drinking it I'm breathing it. Top class IIPA that seemingly hasn't suffered from a round the world trip, and well deserving of the honour of my 1000th BA review!	4.48
4554	Sosus	Juice bomb. Poured 16 oz can into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow. With about an inch of head that is lacing down the glass as I drink it. Get quite a bit of fruity citrus aromas. Get a hint of pine as well. Taste orange and apricot. Nice bitterness. Another great beer from Toppling.	4.5
4555	Sosus	"Hazy golden body with a nice white head
The mosaic brings a strong passionfruit note, the mouthfeel is very nice. The whole thing is flavourful but always balanced
Great stuff"	4.55
4556	Sosus	16oz can dated 2/14/19.. Pours hazy gold with an inch-plus head of white. Nice retention and lacing. Tropical fruit in the nose with shades of grapefruit, pineapple, and lemon-lime. Medium bodied with a creamy, soft mouthfeel. Juicy citrus on the palate with zero malt and a minimal bitterness. Pineapple, grapefruit, and tangerine zest. Finishes juicy but dry.	4.25
4557	Sosus	Lata. De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. Viendo the OA 2x02-03. Con caña de lomo julian martin. Se consagra toppling goliath como unos de mis favoritos fabricantes de ipa. Textura y equilibrio entre el amargor y la frutalidad perfectos	4.75
4558	Sosus	Smell is beautiful combo of pineapple and orange. Taste is orange and citrus, light malt and deep ripe fruit on the back of the palette. Mouthfeel is somewhat on the dry side. Really nice NEIPA.	4.3
4559	Sosus	16oz can. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with 2 inches of frothy head. Tons of lacing. Sweet aroma of tropical fruits. Pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and guava. The taste is mostly the guava and pineapple but a fair amount of bready malts this time. Tangerine, grapefruit and pineapple finish. Creamy and soft with a dry mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for having a higher ABV. Worth seeking out.	4.24
4560	Sosus	I love me some mosaic, and this one checks all the boxes. Great look, feel and nose complement the juicy flavor. Nothing to complain about here, sneaky crushable at 8%.	4.52
4561	Sosus	"Pours a golden orange with a bit of haze. A large frothy head retains well, and yields lots of foamy and thick lacing.
The dynamic aroma opens with a burst of tropical fruit, particularly, pineapple and papaya. This is followed by citrus and stone fruit. A bready malt base is evident, as is and herbal, grassy and piny aroma. There is also a melon like aroma midway.
The taste opens juicy, fruity and sweet, with notes of stone fruit and citrus. Flavors of peach, nectarine, apricot and orange pith stand out in particular. The malt base is bready and the oats and wheat add a roundness to the flavors. Little to no bitterness, however, a subtle piny and grassy slowly develops and ends up overtaking the sweetness.
Medium bodied with a frothy and soft mouthfeel. A moderate to gentle carbonation. The finish carries a fruity zest and some herbal spice.
I’ve now drank this twice within the past two days from the can, and curiously, each time there were some marked difference. The first time it felt more sweet and juicy, while the second time it felt more grassy and spicy. Nevertheless, this is an outstanding IPA by an outstanding brewery."	4.34
4562	Sosus	Opaque gold with a dense creamy white foam head. Nose is earthy herbal and dank, lime green, floral, blueberry, melons, tropical fruit, a little bready, with citrus and resinous pine. Tastes like a beautiful representation of Mosaic with blueberry notes, honeydew melon, tropical mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, orange citrus pith, light crackery bready malt, some earthy herbal dankness, lemongrass and bitter resinous pine. Feels soft and juicy, medium plus bodied, creamy smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a really nice Mosaic hopped DIPA.	4.71
4563	Sosus	"I am drinking this on tap at Lake and Irving. It smells citrusy and lemony with some light fruit and light floral. It is hazy gold under a 1/2"" white cap. the flavors are spicy, citusy and lemony with a medium plus bitterness and a rich malt flavor in the background. It is very creamy with a medium body and carbonation. A solid brew."	4.5
4564	Sosus	Sosus pours a hazyish copper color, with chunks, and a small lacing head. Big creamy hoppy aroma. Flavor is creamy, nice hop flavors, a good bitterness, and a nice little kick at the end. Good body and feel. Overall, very good beer, a little bit hoppier and bitter for a NEIPA.	4.46
4565	Sosus	Canned on 12-07-2018 with a best by date of 04-06-2019 and opened and drank on 02-13-2019. Very light in quality IPA tastes. Decent hops aroma but very light otherwise.	3.79
4566	Sosus	Pours orange that nears on opaque in terms of transparency. Head is just north of two fingers of foam in the color white. Head retention is good. Aroma is pineapple, mango and melon dew all right on the front end. As these heavy tropical fruits fade, mango, orange, and lemongrass come on with hints of bready, toasty malts behind it all. Pineapple is the big player here. Flavor profile is mango, tangerine, melon dew, orange, and herbal/sticky hops with pineapple coming on big at the end. Tropical fruits start and finish it, with the middle focusing more on orange juice and bready, earthy malts. It definitely has a fruit smoothie sort of taste. Mouth feel has a touch of grain at the onset and then fades away quickly to produce a semi-textured and chalky, soft feel. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, big pineapple, this NE IPA covers up its 8% ABV extremely well. That said, it's sweet enough that consumption is limited to sips, but not sweet enough that it becomes cloying or burdening.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can.	4.14
4567	Sosus	On tap, pours a lightly hazy deep gold. Smell and taste really show the Mosaic, with a good combination of berries, tropical fruit and some earthy herbs. Sharpish carbonation. Good stuff.	4.46
4568	Sosus	A great DIPA from Topplong Goliath! This one had great hope and great depth to its taste and great one for sure. But up against King Sue it’s amazing but I like King Sues more citrus pop to it. So this is great for those that love a strong DIPA and want a less fruity bang. Still a winner in my book!!	4.5
4569	Sosus	Poured from a sixteen ounce can into a tulip.... As a native of the Hawkeye state, I'm undoubtedly an apologist for this Decorah brewer--but these folks deserve it. Even though I live next door, in S.D., it's only recently that a good variety of TG's brews have been available here.. The pour is pretty special. Pours a spectacularly hazy honey gold/orange, with a decent head (the only possible knock) and excellent lacing..  1,405 characters	4.5
4570	Sosus	Hazy but not completely opaque lemon yellow. Excellent head production and retention.. Dank and herbal nose. Pineapple, mango, and oregano.. Crisp and clean. Fruity, bubblegum, orange, grapefruit, papaya, dankness, hay, cracker. Really quite drinkable, with a strong dankness on the second half, accompanied by juicy notes of orange, pineapple, and guava..  378 characters	4.38
4571	Sosus	Bottle poured into a Russian River Brewing Co pub glass. A: Pours hazy golden orange amber with a frothy light tan head that hangs around for a while before settling to a firm layer and leaving some thick lacing.. S: Tropical fruit, pineapple, passion fruit, and papaya, zesty citrus, lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine, floral notes, the faintest hint of blueberry, biscuity malt, and caramel honey sweetness..  1,112 characters	4.27
4572	Sosus	12/31/18 (Chicago): $17.99 Four Pack (plus $2.04 tax - seriously WTF!) purchased at Binny's on Irving Park Road in Six Corners. Canned at the Toppling Goliath brewery in Decorah, Iowa on 12/7/18. 16 oz canned poured into pint glass. Hazy golden pour, light white head and lacing. Very sweet citrus aroma. Nicely balanced taste, citrus and pineapple sweetness balanced by slightly bitter hops. This is the type of balanced NE IPA I prefer over very sweet offerings. Mouth feel somewhat dry, carbonation holds well but mild, very easy drinking IPA. Overall excellent pour and offering by Toppling Goliath, glad I have three more left!	4.32
4573	Sosus	Pours a hazy bright yellow with a large white head with staying power, great lacing. Aroma is full of fruity hops. Flavor is pineapple and citrus fruit, sweet in front with nice hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is light to medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Overall a super beer.	4.5
4574	Sosus	"Poured from an undated bomber to a nonic.
Hazy yellow gold with a gorgeous froth that fades to non-contiguous lacing at half-glass.
Taste is musty pineapple in the best sense. Starts pineapple, fades to pure mosaic, back to sweet juice then the afterglow is pure pucker dry. Alcohol is fairly hidden until the end of the session.
Mouth chew is moderate which seems to fit well.
I really love this beer."	4.56
4575	Sosus	Dated 12/7/18 on the bottom of the can, a little over 3 weeks since brewing.. Pours an extremely hazy golden straw in the glass with two fingers of fluffy white head. Nose is super fresh; notes of earth, grass, blueberry, slight guava, mild freshly cut herbs and a hint of pepper. Taste follows the nose except for the fruit profile and a stronger emphasis on the herbaeceous notes. I get tropical notes of passion fruit, mango and guava instead of some of the blueberry I got on the nose. I also get a bit of the sweet malt and a little pine. A smooth medium body with some bitterness hanging around at the end. No detectable notes of the ABV. Sosus is a wonderful, balanced example of a single hop mosaic brew, but it didn't blow my socks off or anything like that. The strongest negative of this one is the price.	4.31
4576	Adam From The Wood	A classic. This one is 2018. It looks just as it should, calm and a little dangerous. The nose waves a baseball bat worth of flavors around behind its back and says “I’m going the hit you with this, very soon”. Raisin/cherry fruit tones come to the fore, backed by brandy and vanilla cookies. And of course, the taste does indeed clobber you with huge crescendo of coffee, fruit, booze, char, leather and umami. Fantastic. The mouthfeel, again, is just as it should be. This is a unique beer and very much deserves its high reputation. Speaking from experience, and without any fear of contradiction, I can also report that this beer ages beautifully.	4.49
4577	Adam From The Wood	2018 vintage. Really excited to find this at the brewery while visiting Portland. As expected, absolutely no sound when the cap was taken off. Zero carbonation, which immediately seems strange. Pours a gorgeous dark brown. The nose is incredible. Reminds me of a 30 year old English barleywine. Tons of oak, caramel, alcohol-soaked cherries, leather, sweet molasses. This, to me, smells old and delicious. Taste is crazy. Immediately picking up strong nutty flavors. The lack of carbonation conveys a syrupy taste. Picking up lots of dark cherries, blackberries, toffee, burnt wood bitterness, leather, rubber, oak, and maybe a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick - very bold. Overall, this is a mesmerizing beer with a deep hierarchy of flavors. Absolutely fantastic, and an experience I won't forget.	4.74
4578	Adam From The Wood	2018 batch from a 12 oz bottle.. As advertised, the pry of the cap... nothing. As expected with an HotD special release, this is still. Burnt chestnut brown bordering black. Not a single bubble resides above, yet Adam From the Wood is beautiful.. Despite a lack of pressure, the ability to deliver aromas upon relief of the cap is impressive. All the glorious elements that make up Adam (tobacco, leather, molasses, brown sugar), are met with a perfect, non-overpowering level of barrel influence. Lightly charred wood and decadent vanilla elevate Adam to the next level..  1,671 characters	4.68
4579	Adam From The Wood	12oz Bottle. 2018 Vintage. Big, huge, giant thanks to Phil for this beautiful son of a bitch. Adam from the Wood is the darkest of browns, bordering on black. It's much darker than the original. It's also still, like many of the newer HotD special releases. A hard pour produces a couple fleeting bubbles here and there but this puppy is flat. It's worked in past iterations so let's see where it takes us here..  2,080 characters	4.6
4580	Adam From The Wood	2014 bottle. Cocoa, dates, fig, oak, milk chocolate, raisin, vanilla, tobacco, light roast, caramel, brown sugar, tootsie roll. Very little carbonation but very complex	4.35
4581	Adam From The Wood	Glad to tick this beer off my list.. Little to no carbonation. Nice nose of sticky pudding, dates and some alcohol. Tastes delicious, sweet caramel finish. The lack of any carb lends to a fairly thin mouthfeel but was still silky smooth	4.59
4582	Adam From The Wood	The color of the body is a dark woody brown topped with a creamy blanket dying to a thin tan ring leaving wavy lace swept away by slowly descending clear legs.. Aroma is sharp and woody with caramel, dark fruits and cigars.. Taste is woody and surprisingly chocolatey, as un-aged Adam was as well. I also get dark fruit and old, but nonetheless boozy, musty whiskey..  460 characters	3.58
4583	Adam From The Wood	Dark brown sluggy beer, some sediment at the bottom. Slick oily mouthfeel, a slight booziness but concealed nicely. raisin, fig, caramel, dark chocolate, some woody oak notes, real solid beer.	4.59
4584	Adam From The Wood	Brown appearance without a head. Aroma is a dark fruit caramel that is slightly sweet. Taste is also a dark fruit and raisin with some caramel that is a little hollow.	4.02
4585	Adam From The Wood	Pours entirely flat, with no head to speak of, almost black, with a brighter hazelnut quality to it.. Has a prominent, wooden alcohol bite on the nose, with lots of oak and earth, toning down the spices of the barrel. A toffee note evolves from this, sweet and rustic, with a dried raisin peak and lots of toasted coconut. Pretty complex, a new aroma nuance seems to be found, everytime I put my nose in the glass.. Drinks silk and slick with no hint of carbonation, showcasing each and every flavor quality. Its mouthfeel is medium bodied and entertaining till the last moment..  1,195 characters	4.09
4586	Adam From The Wood	2015 vintage (bourbon) drank on 12/26/2016. No head whatsoever, similar to the other HOTDs, which I always find enjoyable. boozy caramelly bourbon on the smell and nose. Not super thick, but definitely right on point for an Old Ale. Very well done beer here that I am happy to have finally gotten to enjoy	4.5
4587	Adam From The Wood	Appearance- The beer poured a deep murky brown color with mocha bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.. Smell - The nose is that of magnificent sweet dark fruits with a hint of booze.. Taste - I detect prunes, nuts, caramel, raisins, and a slight vanilla presence with the wood coming through at the end. The overall profile is like that of a port..  497 characters	4.64
4588	Adam From The Wood	"12 oz 2015 vintage at brewery. L - poured thick cola, minimal lacing and no head.
S - Caramel, dried figs and dates.
T - more of the same, with thick sweetness and slightly oxidized sherry notes
F - really thick, almost no carb. Overall an amazing beer, but the low carb does pull it down from being the best it can be"	4.53
4589	Adam From The Wood	Had this at the taproom with lunch. Delicious. Dark brown chocolate color with just a slight tan head. Big bourbon aromas. Taste is at first just a smooth bourbon, but follows with some stone fruit, cherry, peach. Nice complexity. Mouth is smooth, medium body. Overall, a delicious and very drinkable BA ale.	4.91
4590	Adam From The Wood	2015. Dark brown pour with just a few bubbles that do not amount to any type of head. Smells of caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, tobacco and oak. Tastes of dark fruit with sweet flavors of chocolate, toffee, brown sugar blending perfectly with flavors of soy, oak, bourbon, leather and tabacco. Almost zero carbonation with a slightly sticky mouth feel that helps give this virtually flat beer some body. Overall, an amazingly delicious and complex BA old ale. The lack of carbonation may throw some people off, but doesn't take away from the drinking experience to me.	4.54
4591	Adam From The Wood	It's definitely a unique beer, but not one I think I'd care to repeat. Maybe my pallet has been ruined by too many IPAs, but this beer just wasn't for me. The complexity was interesting though, and the look and smell were promising, but the flavor was too much for me to enjoy regularly.	3.8
4592	Adam From The Wood	"2015 vintage
poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep murky brown color with just a wisp of fizzy head that disappears immediately, leaving nothing behind. S- tons of dark fruit and oak on the nose. Strong raisin, fig & date. Also plenty of earthy tobacco & leather that mixes with a sweet caramel, toffee & brown sugar character. The three years of oak aging brings out strong woody notes that give aromas of wet oak, earth & a hint of vanilla. Incredibly complex.  1,154 characters"	4.68
4593	Adam From The Wood	"L: Burgundy, mocha, and maroon opaque hues with literally no head whatsoever
S: Bourbon, vanilla, and aged oak
T: Initial burst of soy, met with a complex melange of cocoa, light roasted coffee, plums, blackberries, and dark fruits
F: Medium body and absolutely no carbonation
O: This is another interesting and complex old ale from HotD. I thoroughly enjoyed this 2014 batch that was replete with several nuanced and well blended flavors."	4.59
4594	Adam From The Wood	12oz bottle of the 2015 vintage. Served in a snifter glass.. Pours a dark mahogany brown body, half finger white head with minimal retention, no lacing. It's pretty short-lived, but not to the point of clearly lacking any carbonation. Smell is rich dark fruit, bourbon, sweet chocolate malt, tobacco, touch of smoke, lots of oak. Complex and sweet, a touch boozy. Flavour is similar in its complexity. Dark fruit, a bit of smoke and ashiness, tobacco, char, chocolate, molasses, plenty of bourbon. Hefty bourbon presence is quite nice in mellowing out the rest of the beer which may otherwise be overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lower in carbonation but still reasonably carbonated. Mild bourbon heat on the finish. Very nice and complex beer with a lot of flavours going on here, and certainly superior to the Rye version from 2015. Not flat, but carbonation is not ideal either.	4.3
4595	Adam From The Wood	Dark brown color with basically no head. Aroma is intense on dried fruits, mostly figs and plums, with a fortified wine character. Taste is also very fruit forward, sweet but not cloying, syrupy, sticky, woody, intense and complex. Body is heavy, almost flat, a bit boozy as well. Feels like a liquor. Complex taste and aroma but feels too boozy and flat to be up there with the best of the style.	4.4
4596	Adam From The Wood	12 oz bottle, 2014 version. Pours brown with no head or carbonation.. The aroma is baker's chocolate, bourbon, black licorice, roast and some dark fruit with slightly harsh alcohol.. The flavor is sweet chocolate malts, dark fruit, roast and some strong bourbon alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with no carbonation..  442 characters	3.68
4597	Adam From The Wood	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. 2014.. Pours muddy brown, uncarbonated, pretty raw looking.. Aromas of molasses, sweet toffee, dark caramel, leather, dark fruit..  467 characters	4.18
4598	Adam From The Wood	2014 Bottle. This is a still bottle. Boo. Oak, earthy malt, toffee, vanilla and nougat. Flavors are reigned in and balanced. The only thing holding this back is the lack of carb. Still enjoyable, but could be better.	3.79
4599	Adam From The Wood	2011 batch. 12 oz bottle poured into snifter. A: Deep mahogany in color, viscous, with virtually no head or lacing upon a moderate pour.. S: Tons of caramel and burnt sugar at the front of the bouquet. At the edges, booze, sweetened. Notes of pit fruit linger..  791 characters	4.65
4600	Adam From The Wood	2015 12 oz bottle. Thanks Bob. Murky dark brown. Aroma of figs, raisins, sweet dried dark fruit. Oak, caramel, touch of vanilla. Taste is like chewing on a bourbon barrel flavored tootsie roll. Brown sugar, boozy without the heat. Mouthfeel is watery and uncarbonated. Seems out of place in such a flavorful beer.	4
4601	Bodhi	Classic American IPA that doesn't shy away from putting Citra hops in the spot light. Equated to a boozier Zombie Dust that has traditional bitterness but approachable for people of all palates. Highly accessible in Ohio, making it an impressive go-to brew.	4.5
4602	Bodhi	Gifted to me by @leperjim. Bottled 6/3. Clear dark bronze color, minimal head and lacing. Mildly dank sharp hop smell, little bit of pine. Taste is bitter and bold hops. Feel is crisp, clean, mouth watering and medium body. Excellent “old style” IPA.	4.53
4603	Bodhi	"Appearance: orange in color with a 1 "" head that slowly falls.. Smell: citrus and a hint of peach comes through to the nose.. Taste: caramel, grapefruit, orange, peach, and a hint of pine. Bitterness is moderate. Alcohol is well hidden..  361 characters"	4.19
4604	Bodhi	Copper colored with a murky complexion. There’s a fingernail of dishwater white around the rim and covering the majority of the top. Light lacing is present. The aroma is of tangerine and pine. I’m tasting tangerine and citrus fruit. The mouth is very resinous and lightly sticky.	4.14
4605	Bodhi	My buddy had been begging me to try this saying it is the best brewed beer in Ohio. We have similar tastes in IPAs so I decided to give it a try. It was a 22 ounce draft. The look is a nice dark golden color. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus and pine hops. The taste is the same. These balance of flavors mask the 8.3% alcohol content. Definitely can drink this down pretty quick and get a nice buzz. The beer is super smooth and has a nice dry finish. Definitely having it again at some point. Very, very impressed. May be Ohio's best IPA.	4.86
4606	Bodhi	Received a single, twelve ounce bottle as a part of a trade almost a year ago. Looking through top-rated beers, and realized that I forgot to review. I did not trade for this, it was included as a bonus-brew. Not distributed to MA. Pleasantly surprised, very nice brew.	4.5
4607	Bodhi	"L: Dark gold color with a good amount of off -white head. The lacing is crazy on this thing, it clings to the glass for days.
S: Getting a ton of citrus and tropical fruit scents, followed by a nice hoppy pine scent.
T: Tons of citrus in the flavor and also some pine notes.
F: Medium-bodied with a good carb and a nice dry finish.
O: This one does not disappoint, super solid DIPA."	4.27
4608	Bodhi	"Bodhi is only my second of the Top 10 rated IIPAs. I am neither a fan of the style, nor the hype around it.
Some of that explains my low rating... and my tendency to rate extreme beers not relative to their style but relative to what I prefer (which is not extreme.). But Bodhi starts fine, a good-looking gold and a really aromatic, hoppy/fruity/malty melange. But the bitterness caught my buds by surprise and wouldn't let go (50 IBU is usually above my pleasure threshold and I'm guessing Bodhi is 75+.). Columbus' flagship, Bodhi is the first I've had from them. So I went on their website and saw Bodhi is a GABF award-winner. But, they seem otherwise to focus just on their beer and for that I give an OA hug."	3.99
4609	Bodhi	Pours a deep amber and a reasonable head, decent lacing.. Smells very fruity, orange and peach. Booze not noticeable despite the hefty ABV.. Taste is dominated by fruit, mostly peach and citrus. Bitterness is moderate but only noticed after the fruit flavor..  579 characters	4.2
4610	Bodhi	The best of the 4 beers I tried from this company. Hazy color. Tropical taste. Lots of papya and grapefruit. Finishes Crisp and juicy and overall good feeling	4.53
4611	Bodhi	Bodhi brewed by Columbus Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.50% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint beer glass a nice golden amber color. There is also a nice white head on top of this brew with a nice amount of lacing. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, a slight citrus flavor, with earthy grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Bodhi. So far this is a nice inviting brew, now for the taste. It is rich and bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness with citrus flavors. The body of Bodhi is a medium to heavy but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. It goes down this smooth, the citrus flavors are a nice touch to this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold ,Rich, Clean , Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Bodhi a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Columbus Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA.	4.18
4612	Bodhi	Wonderful balance of malt and citrusy hops. Attractive on the eye with a golden color with white head that rescinds into nice lacing. Remarkable is the mouthfeel - super easy to drink and masking its DIPA qualities. Citrusy on the nose and palate. Wonderful beer.	4.86
4613	Bodhi	A wonderful full flavor , earthy , multi-layered beer. Pours a Beautiful deep copper with a thick off white head. Mostly a deep earthy smell with some citrus , flower undertones . Fills the mouth with flavor but is still somewhat subtle at first taste and isn’t overwhelming . Keeps you curious for the next taste . A great beer	4.48
4614	Bodhi	"12oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Super fresh at about a week old.
Nose is citrus-ey and pine.
Taste is flowers, a tad sweet, almost pollen like. Maybe a bit of onions? Can't pinpoint it.
Great balance. I think that is why I'm enjoying this so much."	4.52
4615	Bodhi	Bottled on 7/16/18. Pours a deep golden copper with a finger and a half of fluffy, off-white head; specky lacing continues to wall the glass, and a nice ring permeates the surface.. Aroma is of deep, heavy, almost mineral-like earthy elements with a touch of sweet citrus and light tropical tones; floral undertones, overripe peach, and dank, herbal hops..  931 characters	4.22
4616	Bodhi	"L- poor as a slightly hazy golden orange color with a very thin, white head that just collects on the ring outside the glass. Has a little bit of carbonation.
S- smell is not very big. Probably mostly grapefruit rinds and some slight malt and Spice.
T- this one tastes amazing. Grapefruit and mango Citrus hop with definite garlic and onion backing. Finishes with a slight sweet candy mango that really finishes it off well. Just a slight Pine resin in the end as well that resinates up the nose.
O- Perfect Balance. No wonder this one's in the top 250."	4.57
4617	Bodhi	Pours a clear deep gold/pale amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of biscuity malt with hoppy accents of citrus and light tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and a hint of grass. Taste is a great balance of biscuity, lightly sweet malt and bright, hoppy, slightly zesty citrus and tropical fruit notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lime, mango and and papaya. There is a light resinous quality to this as well, with a hint of grass and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/lively carbonation.. This seems like somewhere inbetween an Old School and West Coast IPA, but in a really good way. Great balance of malts and hops, sweetness and bitterness. Not a hint of booze or bubble gum to this, which is impressive given the 8.5% ABV. This actually drinks surpringly easy.	4.25
4618	Bodhi	I had a 4 ounce pour of this in a bar in downtown Columbus. Like so many imperial IPAs, I loved the hop taste, but found the overall quality to be marred by a boozy taste. It's a good beer, but many other IPAs pack as much taste with less alcohol.	4.25
4619	Bodhi	"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a nice big white foamy head that lingers for quite a while. Aroma is a bit off - faint pine, citrus, I think the off smell is actually a big grapefruit pith aroma. Big beer here - loads of hops: piney, lots of citrus - orange, lemon, grapefruit. Great balance of hops and malt, nice amount of bitterness the whole way through. Classic west coast style DIPA, definitely a go to beer.. 6/13/18
12 oz bottle dated 4/9/18
4.25 rating"	4.06
4620	Bodhi	"A-Pours a very nice light amber color with a generous head and lacing
A-Aroma has abundant hoppy hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a resonating hoppy flavor
M-A medium bodied well carbonated beer
O-A well balanced beer"	4.4
4621	Bodhi	Pours a glowing amber-golden color with a spongy, big head.. Smells of a pungent interplay of ripe oranges and spritzy lime zest, together with a light, crackery maltiness to back up the hops.. Has an oily, medium mouthfeel with a perfectly nuanced, lively carbonation and a long lasting lime finish..  970 characters	4.52
4622	Bodhi	Pours an effervescent amber with a thumb of cream colored head. Pretty good head retention & lacing. S: Piney with a little grapefruit. T: Follows the nose, breadyness as well, plus a little dryness. Dryness with grapefruit, a little orange as well. Finishes orangey, bready & a little dry with grapefruit.  402 characters	4.04
4623	Bodhi	This is a great beer. Similar to thier standard IPA, but more hoppy and much stronger. Can only have a couple and you must go down in abv. Color is deeper yellow. Smell is very skunky. Flavor is fantastic. 12oz bottle Columbus, oh. 16oz draft at Pastimes Pub New Albany Oh.	4.85
4624	Bodhi	Thanks to WesMantooth for this one, from a ninja box during NBS BIF #007. 12oz bottle poured into 10oz fluted tulip. Poured a beautiful, clean, clear, bright golden color with about 1/2 inch of white head that had good retention and light-medium lace.. A big, bold blast of classic hops burst out of the bottle right at the crack of the cap. Lots of grapefruit and other citrus, with very light grain.. Very similar on the tongue; just a well done version of the classic American ImpIPA..  718 characters	3.84
4625	Bodhi	Pours a slightly foggy yellow with a finger and a half of white head. Head retention is fair with a few strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is delicate notes of orange, lemon zest, and papaya with slightly more dense notes of biscuit, pale, and bread malts. Flavor profile is lemon zest, papaya, orange, and mango. Biscuit, and pale malts hide behind, but provide a consistent base. Mouth feel is medium in terms of thickness, with a grainy, semi-harsh carbonation feel. Overall, a great DIPA. Lovely hop qualities that are far from overpowering. It's a well balanced beer with great flavor.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle.	4.46
4626	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	"2019 vintage. Pours a deep, opaque dark brown with a minimal tan head.
Aroma is roast, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon.
Taste is nutty, dark chocolate, roast coffee, molasses, raisin. Closes with a bitter, boozy note on the tongue.
Mouthfeel is slightly thin, smooth and slightly sticky.
Overall, complex and delicious."	4.55
4627	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Glossy black with a short mocha blanket settling to a soft persistent collar.. This has an excellent balance between the wonderfully nutty, smoothly roasty stout body and the sticky, syrupy barrel character that dries out nicely on the swallow. The barrel provides Raisinettes, coconut drizzle, and bruleed toffee notes within the whiskey that's warming but measured.. The body is actually moderately light and silky with a light crackly carbonation that comes to a semi-dry finish at first, but then leaves a light stickiness on the lips.	4.3
4628	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	750 ml bottle into snifter; 2018 vintage, bottle #4949. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Very mild herbal, grass, roast, charred bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, dark/brown bread/crust, vanilla, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic, Minimal warming alcohol for 10%, with no lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the minimally bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic soft feel. Not as much barrel as I expected, but adequate. Fantastic rich malt complexity; solid barrel presence/integration, restrained fruity yeast, and mild earthy hops. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example.	4.25
4629	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Jet black with a dark brown head that retreats to the edges of the glass. The aroma is an amazing blend of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, raisins and caramel. The taste is exactly the same as the smell with the bourbon up front and the rest of the flavors coming in after that. There is a nice bitterness that lingers with the sweetness of the raisins and caramel at the end. Just a delicious stout.	4.66
4630	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2019 bottle. 12oz, 11% ABV.. The pour is dark and viscous, poured cold so allowed room to warm, so not much of any rising head or visible carbonation. A thin beige ring surrounds the top of the beer in the glass.. A huge chocolatey aroma reminds me of brownie batter, with a nice underlying complexity of molasses and dark fruit. There's a roasty malt character to this as well, but that initial chocolate dessert sweetness really wins the day on the nose..  1,134 characters	4.55
4631	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Really slick and tasty and does everything I’d want for a bba Stout. There is a nice caramel sweetness and the nose that really perseveres through the line. This is a sweet beer all things considered. But I appreciate the well constructed layers	4.28
4632	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Ok, so I recently picked up some of these down here in Milwaukee. Never had it before, was on my want list for several years now.. Poured a dark near black. Smells heavily barrel forward, and not cheap barrel at that. Tastes like the nose; barrel forward with the beer itself complimenting the notes of the barrel. Barrel lingers in the mouth for a bit then fades to the base beer.. If you want a BA stout that isnt barrel dominant, this isn't for you. Interestingly, though, I usually fall in that camp and I absolutely love this beer and am hoarding all I can find of it.	4.56
4633	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2019 vintage. Have had most of Lift Bridge's offering and found them to be good but not exceptional; Silhouette is the latter. Pours pitch black with some light barely visible at the top edge in my Spiegelau stout glass. Delicious meld of coffee and bourbon on the nose. Flavor profile goes together perfectly, not too much bourbon but the perfect amount IMHO and not too boozy but just right. Nice full body but not too much either. This is fantastic and given the choice of this or some of the better know BA stouts like BCBS, CBS or KBS I've enjoyed, I'd pick this over them.	4.73
4634	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	"2019 version poured from a 12 oz. bottle on 1-27-19.
I typically age these beers for a few years but I'm glad I tried it fresh this time. Ranks at the top of my favorite years of this beer."	4.6
4635	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Pours pitch black with a medium mocha colored head. Smells great with notes of barrel present but not overpowering. Tastes like a lot of chocolatey goodness and roasted coffee. Very rich feel and taste. Great barrel taste and balance. Think this reminds me a lot of BA Expedition.	4.59
4636	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	"Thank you Vidblain for this
750 ml bottle, 2017, poured into tulip. A- Black with a small tan head. S- Bourbon, chocolate, charred oak, molasses, hints of vanilla.  437 characters"	4.55
4637	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	On tap at Republic. Poured an opaque, jet-black color with a small, brown head of foam. It smelled of bourbon, oak, vanilla, coffee, dark chocolate and toffee. Rich bourbon taste with dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee and a roasted malt.	4.59
4638	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	"Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. 2018 vintage.
Black colored body, with slim dark brown back lit highlights. Partial finger head upon pouring results in a scenic show of rising bubbles replenishing the scattered islands and thin ring. Leaves behind a few scattered, small spots of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts soaked in bourbon, which brings out smells of coffee, chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit.
Taste is robust and layered, with bourbon soaked dark roasted malts, chocolate, molasses, and prune. The coffee aspect is there but weak.
Medium plus mouth feel. Slightly oily. Good carbonation.
Very solid barrel aged stout, with balanced expressions of nose and flavors. Make sure to allow the beer to warm up to recommended temperatures. This allows for a fuller sensory experience. Really tastes like bourbon soaked prunes."	4.46
4639	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Outstanding BA stout. It’s got tons of chocolatey sweetness and a very pronounced, but not dominating barrel character. The bourbon blends perfectly with the big malty flavors of dark fruit, and chocolate. The mouthfeel is super thick and coating, perfect for the style. Overall I’ll be making the effort to get this again, it’s great.	4.56
4640	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Very good barrel aged russian imperial stout. Doesn't meet the hype, but does not disappoint either. The body did meet the hype, with a roasty, thick, and boozy feel all the way through the glass. The taste was a bit smoky, with the bourbon and malt leading the charge with aftertastes of dark chocolate, oat and tobacco. Very enjoyable, would have again on a cold winter night	4.05
4641	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2017 vintage.. A: Pours a brown-tinted black, and manages just a thin ring of dense tan head with an aggressive pour. Exceedingly persistent. A few long streaks of lacing.. S: Sweet baker’s chocolate in the forefront, alongside vanilla, bourbon, and oak, with a hint of roast that’s almost char-like..  848 characters	4.45
4642	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2018 bomber, and I'm very excited to be able to try this one. Pours black and moderately thick but not syrupy, with very little head that eventually burbles up from below. The nose is a bit subdued, with cacao nibs, vanilla, red wine tannins, and malt balls, plus a tiny hint of black cherry and plum on occasion. Big bourbon notes on the tongue that amplify the aromas and provide some spice. Punching above its weight class at 10% abv. A nice, moderately full mouthfeel and boozy finish.. I will definitely try to get another bottle of this to put away and age. I love it.	4.41
4643	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this one.. Pours a medium-dark brown body, translucent on the pour but black in the glass. Small brown ring of foam.. On the nose is roasty malts, dark fruits, figs, whiskey and light chocolate. Not a super potent aroma..  647 characters	4.11
4644	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2017 bottle poured into a teku. Dark brown with a subtle head. Aroma is nice...barrel, vanilla, toffee and chocolate. Subtle hints of molasses and dark fruit. Taste really let me down. Minimal barrel, slight booziness with some dark fruit and molasses. Feel is onthe thinner side. Wanted it to be more viscous. Overall, good beer but don’t see the hype.	4.12
4645	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	"On tap at 2018 release patty.
Motor oil color dark tan head.
Sweet Chocolate, dark fruit smell. Great mouth feel, very luscious. Lot of chocolate up front. Bourbon on the back. Excellent!"	4.57
4646	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Good chocolate and a little heat on the nose. Solid flavor that backed up the aroma, but the thin mouthfeel and bit of heat were not to my liking. Overall a solid brew though	4.08
4647	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a nice bourbon with a touch of vanilla. The taste is a mild bourbon that is a little weak for my taste.	4.27
4648	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2016 vintage, poured into a taster. Chocolate forward, rounded out by nice bourbon barrel notes. A bit thin and hot, which detracted from the overall experience.	4.21
4649	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	An extremely solid Barrel Aged RIS! Not too boozy but the bourbon is definitely there just well hidden. Tons of chocolate on the nose and palate. Would track this one down again for sure! 2015 Vintage	4.79
4650	Barrel-Aged Silhouette	2017 vintage drank in a teku on 3/18/2017. Looks like a russian imperial stout. Deep dark brownish black, but not straight jet black. Thin tan head, medium carb. Medium lacing and the overall feel was probably a bit thin. This was a noticeably sweet RIS with a great barrel presence. The sweetness was a tad cloying at times, but once this warmed up there was a ton of vanilla-y oak and subtle but present bourbon. Hints of dark fruit and molasses probably brought this down from being one of my all time favorites, but still a phenomenal beer. Will seek out more.	4.58
4651	Matt	Bottle from Jeremy. Ruddy brown pour, soft bubbly head. Woody, malty aroma. Taste also leans on the malt, woody, earthy notes. Finishes Dry. Excellent.	3.93
4652	Matt	2013 version on tap at the 25th anniversary party.. Not the prettiest beer. Flavor and texture are indescribably amazing.. (Review under construction).	4.77
4653	Matt	Gifted from @lingenbrau. I thought it lost carbonation, but he told me their stuff is normally under carbed. Either way, it's a winner. Dark muddy brown color. Smell is boozy, oaky, apply. Taste is the old ale style, malty, strong booze, sweet, smoky, woody barrel and apple notes. Smooth, mild burn, trying not to hold the lack of carb against it as I'm not sure if that was how it was intended. Very good.	4.56
4654	Matt	2016 bottle poured into a snifter glass.. Extremely Peaty, earthy, Smokey, boozy, chocolate liquor, applewood, smoked malt, peaty, caramel, bittersweet chocolate, syrupy, very sweet, dark fruits.. No carbonation, medium-heavy body. An interesting, unique beer. Not sure I was a huge fan of the flavor profile, mainly due to the overly peaty / earthy flavors.	3.72
4655	Matt	Another unique and wonderful brew from HOTD. I’d call it somewhere between an American Strong and an Old Ale, but that doesn’t matter because it’s just delicious. After a couple years in my cellar the carbonation has suffered a bit, but many of HOTD’s offerings start out that way, so it doesn’t seem a problem. Nose and taste are both truly world class, so complex and so well integrated that I can’t begin to describe them - you just have to be here!	4.37
4656	Matt	This one pours a very dead looking and murky purplish brown, with no head and no lacing.. This smells very much like apple brandy, with boozy fruit, caramel, and more booze.. This is absolutely hindered by the complete and total lack of carbonation- I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to appreciate something like that. It's got some interesting flavors- like smoke, prunes, chocolate, tobacco and tons of apple brandy. It's super flabby however, and just feels unfinished- I can't get fully behind it. It feels so thin and flat..  697 characters	3.56
4657	Matt	Hardly zero head or carbonation in a 2013. Taste was bourbon soaked raisans. Sweet but quite pleasant. It didn't look great and it was prob a little thin for the abv and the barrel, but defintely respect the old ale style and would not turn it down again.	4.26
4658	Matt	2016 ventage. Dark appearance with no head. Aroma is nutty. Taste is also nutty bourbon with a fairly strong sharp alcohol bite. This should be aged longer to eliminate the alcohol taste.	4.19
4659	Matt	"L: pours thick brown with no head at all. No hiss when I opened the cap...still
But I don't think this was intentional, kind of worried
S: huge bourbon...seriously reminds me of anabasis almost to a t in the nose
T: there is something wrong here....there is a nasty tabacco flavor"	3.53
4660	Matt	Had been sitting on this for a long time. Wow! Absolutely delicious. A little on the sweet side but very tasty. Soy sauce, tobacco, cocoa, definitely a sipper.	4.35
4661	Matt	Was lucky enough to finally track down a bottle of Matt and enjoy it with a friend. Strong caramel flavors in this Old Ale. Very tasty but absolutely a sipper as this was strong and boozy. Solid but wouldn't probably track it down again.	4.5
4662	Matt	While I wasn't blown away by AFTW, this beer rocked my world! I love the flavor complexities, and enjoyed sipping on this for quite a while. I know it's on the top 250 but I never see anyone talking about it. And they should be.	4.68
4663	Matt	all of the beers we had at hair of the dog were highlights, so its hard to single out this 2008 matt as the standout, but it was pretty darn impressive. no idea what it tasted like fresh, but some time in the bottle has really done it well. one of the few beers i can think of that could stand up over time like this, not a lick of oxidation or staleness in here at all, just a smooth mellow well integrated brew all the way around. rich syrupy viscous dark dark brown pour, still with a little bubbling head on it. notes of campfire, black licorice, cigar, brandy, raisin, and dark chocolate all waft out from the glass slowly and patiently, weaving a complex aromatic tapestry that is entirely unique. burnt leather and bourbon come through the dark english or german malts, rauch type smoke has mellowed some, sticky bread pudding, root beer, then they apple grappa stuff in the finish. man is this layered! it doesnt quite have that roasted barley stout quality to it, it doesnt go that deep, but in its bitter absence, there arises this space for other flavors usually lost to it, and i think this lands perfectly in the middle of all of them. i am amazed how this has done over time, i expected more of a novelty at this age, but that wasnt the case at all. rich and velvety on the palate, the warming alcohol seems necessary too. brilliant beer, what a treat!	4.38
4664	Matt	2013 vintage drank in a snifter 4/12/2016. L-rich and dark, dark brown with a minimal head and thick lacing. S-scotch, caramel, and a little sweet booze. The Belgian candy sugar is noticeable here for sure..  1,006 characters	4.68
4665	Matt	I'm not sure what's so special about this beer. Matt? Do you know how many people I know in this world named Matt? I mean, Matheus, now there's a beer. This one is aptly named as it seems pretty common to me.	4.09
4666	Matt	"2013 bottle poured into a teku.. L: Dark brown and caramel hues with an exceedingly thin sandy head and minimal retention
S: Scotch, dark fruits, tobacco, and hints of leather-bound books
T: Oddly complex and varied taste profile that ranges from granny smith apples to mocha coffee to toasted walnuts and butterscotch
F: Thick and full mouthfeel with minimal carbonation
O: This was an exceptional strong ale with an interesting flavor profile with incredible complexity. Honestly this is a phenomenal beer to pour, kickback and then ruminate while reflecting on life - excellent sipper here."	4.57
4667	Matt	2013 bottle at the brewery. Delicious with tons of awesome dark fruit flavors and just a bit of apple. Extremely drinkable, and carbed which helps matters significantly. Just a bit of smoke which is pretty much the perfect amount in this case. My liver and wallet are very thankful I don't live close to HotD.	4.49
4668	Matt	Poured from fridge temp. Pours a murky brown. Nose is smoky malts, dark fruit (cherries, raspberries), and barrel. Taste follows the nose. Huge smoke presence on the taste. Very unexpected based on nose. Smoke dominates throughout. Get a coffee, vanilla, and bitter aftertaste. However, I taste smoke! Mouthfeel is good - I would characterize it as medium bodied.	4.35
4669	Matt	Deep caramel brown with no head. Maintains an oily film on top. Deep smell. Bourbon oak, tobacco, stone fruit. A very intense apple. Bourbon flambé. Some smokey fig. Candi sugar sweet. Smooth and tart. Some resiny stick. Just a great sipping beer.	4.6
4670	Matt	Long time want, thanks Barrythebear! 2010 Vintage (bottle) poured into a snifter.. Appearance: Pours a flat-cola looking, dark brown/almost black with no head or noticeable carbonation at all.. Smell: Boozy apple, slight hint of smokiness, dark fruits, very malty aroma along with some leather and tobacco..  909 characters	4.7
4671	Matt	2013 bottle, Pour is murky brown with low carb. Aroma is big sweet figs, dark fruits, and light barrel. taste is similar, very rich and decadent. HOD homer	4.49
4672	Matt	"2013 bottle enjoyed from snifter.. Flat as usual with these HotD brews.. Great ""Old Ale"" smell and taste. Sweet, but not too much. No smoke as was referred to in other reviews - perhaps the 2013 bottles were different from other vintages."	4.47
4673	Matt	Perhaps this style isn't exactly my thing, or the bottle was off, but i did not enjoy this. Very strong and overly sweet. Molten malt body with very little hop presence. Barrel notes overpowering.	3.18
4674	Matt	Tastes smokey, very little barrel present. It's like a baltic porter mixed with an old ale. Sweet and smokey, interesting to the point that I have few words to describe it, but it's an assault on the palate in a bad way as much as it is in a good way. Would not buy again for a while.	3.48
4675	Matt	"2010 bottle poured into a HotD branded tulip.. A: Pours incredibly dense without a trace of head; viscous in appearance, thick and slightly oily; dark, burnt caramel color.
S: Deep sweetness, caramel/toffee, big malt, slight amount of peat, vanilla/charred oak, hints of alcohol.
T: Massive malty sweetness, lots of woodiness and vanilla, burnt sugar, molasses, dark candied fruits, subtle jam elements, hints of roasted nuts/peat.
M: Very light carbonation - surprising after four years in the bottle. Velvety smooth and slick, viscous and dense.
O: Another incredible offering from HotD, no one does high gravity beers that age as gracefully! I only wish I had another vintage bottle, but I'm excited to crack the 2013!"	4.71
4676	Art	Outstanding beer. Had onsite in Jan 2018. It was incredibly smooth almost like a Chardonnay vs. a beer with that oaky flavor. Beautiful color and overall experience having the beer.	4.5
4677	Art	375ml bottle, Batch 5, dated March 18, 2015, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.. The beer pours a bright golden color, hazy and cloudy with a finger of white, soapy head that has good retention and yields plenty of lacing. The aroma is excellent, great funk, nice and bright, soft oak, light vinous acidity, floral with a touch of sweet pale dough and some berry fruit. The flavors are excellent, beautifully balanced and layered, lovely funk, softly tart citrus, berry fruit, bright white wine grape, lightly acidic with an incredible floral bouquet, soft chewy oak plays with the pale doughy malt, a touch of spice and soft pitted stone fruits. The mouthfeel is excellent, coating and creamy, medium body that is so gentle and soft with the easiest of finishes that is lightly tart.. Verdict: An incredible saison from Hill Farmstead, beautifully balanced, bright and delicate, just an exceptional beer. It’s soft and approachable and effortlessly complex.	4.67
4678	Art	2014 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip at the brewery. Pours a clear gold color with substantial head that dissipates quick. Aroma is lemongrass, subtle vinegar, hay and funk. Taste is all that and then some...very balanced. Some lemon acidity and funk is prominent. Very nice! Feel is what I’d expect for this style of beer. Overall, this is a magnificent and elegant brew. So deliciously tart and also balanced.	4.74
4679	Art	"Look: Straw Yellow Clear with thin white head. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Grapefruit, lime, white whine, white grapes, and barnyard Funk.
Taste: Tart, grapefruit, white whine, white grapes, oak, barnyard Funk, and minerals.
Mouthfeel: Medium with lots of complexity.
Overall: Possibly the best beer I’ve ever had."	4.94
4680	Art	2 pours from different bottles onsite at Hill Farmstead.. This one pours a mostly clear light yellow, with a small head and lots of lacing.. This smells like grassy funk, candied lemon, chalk candy, oaky white wine, stone fruit, lime, and Brett..  564 characters	4.92
4681	Art	Art b5 served from 375ml at the brewery.. Dregs separated by server. Pours a clear, straw body with a one finger white head. That sticks around for the duration of the drink. Spotty lacing.. On the nose is Funky hay, white wine, apple juice, lightly tart citrus, yeasty, barnyard, champagne-like..  621 characters	4.59
4682	Art	Pours gold - a slight bit of haze with a puffy 3 finger head that leaves big rings of lace. Aromas of earthy brett, lemon, white grape, hay and oak - very complex. Taste is spot on - light Oaked malts balanced with a hint of dry white grape, green apple, lemongrass, white pepper and very slight bitterness and sourness - VERY easy to drink.	4.74
4683	Art	How does a Farmhouse Ale get any better than this. Beautiful brilliant golden color with a foamy fluffy sticky head that lasts and sticks to the glass with a dense honeycomb lacing. The wine and oak tones are well balanced with the base ale. Wonderful nose, smooth mouth feel, must try!	4.75
4684	Art	750ml bottle, batch 4. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a clear golden-yellow body, slight straw hue, one finger thick white head, good retention, not much lacing. Smell is brilliant funk, white vinous character, mild-moderate vinegar acidity, light oak, minerals, a bit of underripe peach. Wonderful stuff, so complex. Flavour is similar; there is more of a moderate acidic presence behind the oak and white vinous character. Light cereal grain, mineral and cobweb funk. This is one of the best saisons as far as the flavour goes; the complexity is fantastic. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart and a little dry, and the glass seems to empty itself a bit too quickly, strangely enough. Vinous and light vinegar acidity finishes things off. Overall, fantastic beer that is up there amongst the best of the style.	4.71
4685	Art	Beautiful, almost opaque straw color. Aroma is white wine, oak barrel, warming alcohol, various stone fruit aromas. The taste follows with oaky, dry white wine. Plums and apricots and a slight alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, on the thinner side with a good level of carbonation. Overall, another great beer from HF. Expertly blended and look forward to saving my other bottle for a while!	4.68
4686	Art	"Poured from the bottle into stemmed tulip.
Pours a medium to dark straw with perfect clarity and one finger of head the dissipates.
Aromas are wonderful...yeast, white wine, wood, mild funk.
Flavor is perfection. Lovely sourness mixed with wine and wood. Perfectly balanced.
Mouthfeel was excellent as with all Hill Farmstead beers.
This was a near perfect beer. It's incredible."	4.59
4687	Art	L: Golden yellow pour with minimal head and visible lacing.. S: Sweet citrus, subtle oak, and a strong vinous notes.. T: The beer starts off with a pop of stone fruit sugar sweetness, followed by waves of wine barrel character and a touch of heat from the alcohol. As it warms, lemony tart citrus notes emerge and the wine flavor shines through, enveloping the base beer..  675 characters	4.79
4688	Art	Awesome beer. Wine barrel present, expands on what I love about Arthur. Soft, citrus presence. Makes me want more and more of this. Would bang again!	4.94
4689	Art	Batch 4 (thanks Mike!) served in a HF tulip. Pours a burnished orange hue with a frothy, off-white head that dissipates into a bubbly band around the edges. Nose expresses vinous notes, a hint of vanilla and a trace of apple cider vinegar. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavor profile comes off a bit watered down. There's also the addition of lemon peel. Mouthfeel is light in body with a soft carbonation and a mild acidity. Overall, quite tasty but not sure it lives up to the hype.	4.14
4690	Art	Bottle. Poured a hazy yellow color. Aroma was bright, rustic, funky, and tart with some wet woody/cork. Flavor was still much like regular Arthur but a bit more intensified and with a wine and wood addition. I haven't had Arthur in a while but it stills seems rather closely tied to Art; not an absurd transformation. I love the farmy/rustic quality that Hill Farmstead's farmhouse beers finish with. Really delightful.	4.39
4691	Art	Batch 4, bottled 5/21/2015.. Appearance - Pours a pale straw yellow that is slightly opaque, but you can vaguely see through it. It's golden hue resembles more a glass of Chardonnay than beer, but the narrow, dense, snow-white head gives it away. What the head lacks in height it more than makes up for in retention, as it never fully dissipates; even when it finally sinks, it coats nearly the entire surface with a thin film of foam.Bubbles of carbonation lackadaisically rise to the surface every now then, but they are sparse.. Aroma - The aroma is a blend of fresh-cut grass, lemon peel, nectarines, subtle graininess, and finally a burst of white grapes at the end. It is altogether cohesive and summons and subtle tartness that ties everything together. The fruitiness of it makes it infinitely refreshing to smell, and the acidity coupled with the almost tropical-like fruit blend is nearly flawless in execution. The barrel is integrated seamlessly, with waves of oak, vanilla, and finally the wine itself washing over the other notes without overpowering them..  2,673 characters	4.9
4692	Art	Pours a rich golden grain. Minimal white foam. Vinous funk aroma. It's soft and delicate, lightly tart, vinous but subtly so. A little cheese funk comes out as it warms. There's a little bitterness on the finish. Just a touch. Overall, a very good wine barrel farmhouse ale.	4.31
4693	Art	A- Pours a beautiful golden hue, with hints of orange. A medium sized white head slowly recedes and leaves ample lacing.. S- The aroma is gloriously enticing! Lemony, tart, with notes of soft cheese, and barnyard funk. Loads of granny smith apple! Beautiful white wine and oak character! Super delicate and complex!. T- The flavor is superb and follows the nose quite well. Light tartness, dry white wine, mild funk, and lemon grass. Crazy drinkable and delightful!.  692 characters	4.81
4694	Art	A: Gold, white head that sticks around forever. Hazy, great looking beer. S: Funky...so much funk. That Hill yeast smell, some oak and lemon. T: Lemon, funk, oak, hay, basement...all I want in a beer. M: Carb is right where it needs to be. Keeps it soft and finishes dry, making you want more. O: This beer is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. It's oaky, funky and perfect. Way to go Shaun, you never disappoint	5
4695	Art	Purchased one year ago at the source. Pours a cloudy yellow. Aroma is super funky. Taste largely follows. As it warms it becomes much better. Not sure I get much wine barrel in this.	4.34
4696	Art	B3, hoppypocket, can't thank you enough. Tons of barrel on the nose. Tons of wine barrel, good mineral notes, decent sour. Different and not quite what I was expecting (not in a bad way) would drink again ;-)	4.49
4697	Art	Perfect slighly hazy golden color. Was extremely active in the bottle before pouring. The smell was pleasantly funky and tart...you can smell it the second it pours. The taste blew me away...zero flaws as far as I'm concerned. Everything good about Arthur with the added complexity and tartness from the wine barrels. Even has a bit of vanilla flavor in the aftertaste which was very nice. Less carbed than I was expecting and that's not a bad thing...almost creamy, which I didn't expect either but I really really enjoy. This may just be the best beer I've ever had. Wish I could drink this every day.	5
4698	Art	wow--- what a funky nose---apple meets barnyard funkiness... however, the flavor is a little more restrained and not quite up to the nose... a seriously delicious BA saison, but I have to agree with another reviewer, its no le sarrasin!... next up is Ann so ill have to see how it matches up.... life is rough!	4.48
4699	Art	Batch 3 at a bottle share. This is a stunner and greatly exceeded my expectations. I actually liked this better than Ann, so I'm a bit surprised by the lower ratings.	5
4700	Art	"L: dark straw
S: tart, Meyer lemon flesh, green melon, green grapes
T: same as nose plus french oak. Tart with a hint of sweetness in the finish.
This is the best beer that I have ever tasted"	4.9
4701	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Complex, subtle, sophisticated, beautiful. get the sour funky farmy smell upfront and at first sip, but then more complexity comes through with in the palate, a bit of the citrus flavours you get in a white wine, beautifully balanced. Wanted to try this one for a while, got to have it as part of a Zwanze Day event here in Australia.. A 150ml pour from a keg shipped over from Belgium, would love to try a full bottle or two to appreciate it fully, but even among some very other nice beers, it stood out. well worth a try if you can get your hands on it.	4.45
4702	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"Pours a lightly hazy amber with a rose gold hint around the edges.
Smell has lactic tartness over a rich sweet breadiness, oaky and kinda funky. Light hints of light stonefruit like peach or apricot.
Taste is divine, a nice complex tartness that isn't puckering married with some woody funky bits.
Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Leaves you ready for another
Overall it's not hard to understand why this is held up as the standard bearer for the style. A truly world class display of depth and balance. Tart and funky and lightly sweet. Everything super delicate and well put together. Different flavors show themselves as it warms a bit but each iteration is a joy."	4.74
4703	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Funky hazy tart beer, a true Belgium lambic. We toured the brewery - so cool! One of only breweries in Belgium that did not close or convert to munitions during WWII.	4.56
4704	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"Pours hazy orange yellow out of the bottle. This is the BIO (organic version). A friend brought back from Belgium.
Smell is funky lemon. Super balanced.
Flavor is lemon tart up front with a little balanced funk and finishes to smooth perfect non bitter or tart. So easy to go back for another sip. I want to go to Belgium and drink 100 of these. One of the most balanced nuanced beers I've ever experienced. So greatful to try this."	4.55
4705	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Split a 37.5 cl bottle at a friend's home. My rating is perhaps low because I was expecting a Kriek. That's what he said he had, but he had apparently already shared that with someone else. This tasted more like sour plums.It's not my favorite style. I could have sworn it is 5.5% abv.	3.5
4706	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"2017 vintage enjoyed in the first days of 2019
Slightly hazy pale yellow with a very thin head.
Some funk on the nose but quite clear compared to other gueuzes.
The taste is sour with mostly lactic notes and no acetic notes. Funky bretts, the raw wheat is very present and quite smooth.
Quite dry and with a champagne-like carbonation.
A unique Gueuze. Refined compared to other examples.
Had it a lot of times after that both on tap and in bottle. What strikes me the most is the balance of the beer. Have it fresh you've got a perfectly refreshing drink. Have it a room temperature and you've got a wonderfully complex offering."	4.53
4707	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Bottled 16 June 2017: Pours clear gold color with a 2+ finger white foamy head that seemed like a cloud on top of the brew, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing, most of which slides down quickly.. Smells of barnyard funk, wet grass, a muddy trail and then honey, toasted grains, fruit notes like peach, lemon zest and a very acidic juice like grapefruit juice or sour orange juice. Complex for sure, but everything is muted and even with the funk, fruit and earthy notes interchanging with each whiff. I get floral notes as well after a few minutes.. Tastes of tart fruit like sour white grapes, green apple, lemon zest, red grapefruit, orange peel and then comes funk and what could be brett, along with yeast, dry flowers, peppery spices, rose pedals, honey, wet cardboard or musty bread, some more trailing funk like the smell of wet animal hair and then a dry trailing fruity aspect. It's very complicated and bounces between tart and funky, but the malty base brings sweet grainy notes it that cuts the sourness and allows more fruity flavors to come through. Hard to put my finger on everything that I taste as it's mostly what's listed above with flavors that resemble ginger ale and white wine. Very easy to drink considering the tartness at points. This is a style I need to explore more to build up my appreciation.	4.3
4708	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Had this on tap at Seymour in Greenfield. The beer had a bright, orange-yellow appearance with a thin head. The beer had a mixture of aromas of cherries, white wine, grapes that was wonderfully balanced. The taste had those aromas but it included an apple tartness. Very well carbonated and crisp. Overall, an excellent beer, especially with its aromas and flavors.	4.28
4709	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Golden appearance. Taste of apples with earthiness. Crisp feel in the mouth with solid carbonation. Would pair well with cheese or chicken. Solid finish and aftertaste. Great beer.	4.65
4710	Gueuze 100% Lambic	A: poured from a 750 mL bottle into a taster glass, golden colored with a large white head that dissipates leaving little lacing, clear. S: cider apples, cheese, musty and earthy. T: sweet and sour up front, lemon, tart fruit, earthy hop on the finish with plenty of funky flavor, I still taste a slight cheese aftertaste.  435 characters	4.71
4711	Gueuze 100% Lambic	This was the first ever Cantillon beer that I ever had. It was worth the wait! Love the bottle art. Love absolutely everything about this. Cant wait to try more!	5
4712	Gueuze 100% Lambic	just drank Cantillon Gueuze 100% Lambik (classic) from Brasserie Cantillon, ABV 5.00%, the one in the picture. It is one of the best Gueuze I've ever had. It was a truly pleasant taste experience.. Look: hazy light golden with a thick fluffy white head. Aroma: citrus, some brett yeast, white wine.  563 characters	4.75
4713	Gueuze 100% Lambic	2013 variant, somewhat gentle but down the middle pour yields an almost opaque glowing gold beer topped off with a thin ring of bright white head that quickly recedes. Just beautiful. Nose is tart, fruity, and funky. Palate builds upon this with a robust a complex fruity character - getting some lemon, orange, and grapefruit peel. This is definitely a strong funky and sour quality as well, grassy, oaky, dry, farmhouse notes of earth and hay, slight spice to it and a wine like quality. All of the flavors so smooth and perfectly intergrated. Beautifully light and slightly effervescent mouthfeel. Perfect beer.	4.71
4714	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Pours a deep gold coloration with a tiny, quickly dissipating, fizzy head. Smell is quite funky, with notes of white grape, citrus, hay and a hint of blue cheese. Taste is quite dry, tart and funky, with earthy, musty woody barnyard notes, citrus zest and green apple at the forefront and lighter notes of hay, blue cheese and white grape. Finishes with a dry tartness and a good dose of funk lingering in the aftertaste. Sparkling, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and lively carbonation.. Really well-balanced Geuze with a light sweetness, strong dryness, moderate tartness and strong funky notes. Quite drinkable, but with a certain complexity. This was much better from the bottle than I remember it on tap about a year ago.	4.35
4715	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"Review #500!. L -- Golden straw body with robust effervescence and a handsome white head. Good retention and lacing
S -- Super funk-forward. Generic farmyard smells, wet hay, earth. Quite strong and pungent
T -- Oak barrel, lemon, white wine tannins, hay funk. Quite restrained tartness, which allows for more of the naturally innoculated character to come through.
F -- Medium- mouthfeel, high effervescence. Very drinkable and excellent with food. No bitterness at all
O -- Definitely a worthy torchbearer of the style. The tartness is not overpowering, which I really appreciate.. 89/100.  811 characters"	4.41
4716	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"L: cloudy orange hue. Barely any head, settled very quickly and barely leaves a ring around the glass.
S: sour indeed but mild and not overwhelming
T: Tart lemon zest, funk, sweet tart, oak balanced
F: fresh, citrus forward, dry"	3.73
4717	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"Before I get into this I'm just gonna say it: This is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced in my beering life.. A: Pours with a lovely orange hue, with a creamy one finger head. Looks great.
S: Pineapple, light touches of vinegar, slight undercurrents of pepper, apricot, orange and general citrus.
T: Very well balanced, slightly sweet, not overly sour. It's fine. Dankness from hop decay is here and funkiness is here, but not in spades. IT'S FINE. oh and sweet-tarts, yeah.
M: It's dry, what more do you want?
O: It's really good, but I like my Gueuze intense and this is not intense really, it's barely sour. So to me this is very underwhelming. Girardin is better, Hanssens is waaaay better, all Boon Gueuzes are better, tilquin is better, Lindemans cuvee renee might be as good. I don't look for balance in a lambic, that's not why I'm here. Try it if you can find it, don't turn it down if it is offered to you, but don't wait in line for it, don't sell your soul for it, and don't spend your time wishing you had tried it, IT'S FINE. THAT'S IT."	3.9
4718	Gueuze 100% Lambic	2016, pours a light golden straw yellow with notes of pink and orange. Translucent in appearance with a thin foam head that dissipates quickly. Nose is of light funk, lemon zest a musty oak. Taste of tart lemon and citrus peel that give way to a slight bit of funk, a bit of that burlap sack stored in a barn for 50 years funk if you know what I mean ;) Smooth oak rounds out this one perfectly. Tartness was definitely the star here but I wouldn’t say the beer was overly tart or sour. It had the perfect amount of balance. Medium to light on body with moderate carbonation. Very dry clean finish to it.	4.46
4719	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"Bottle share.
Look: Light pink/amber. No head or lacing.
Smell: Farmhouse, light leather.
Taste: Nice, fruity, very balanced with no overpowering acid.
Feel: Even with no head, carbonation still nice.
Overall: A very nice beer. Wish I could get this locally."	4.38
4720	Gueuze 100% Lambic	Darker golden pour, smaller head. Barnyard, earth, funk, yeast, lemon in the aroma. Funky up front, citrus notes, earthy, barnyard, horseblanket, light wood. Medium to lighter body.	4.46
4721	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"Bottled on 3/29/17. Look: 4.25
Aroma: 4.5
Taste: 4.5
Feel: 5
Overall: 4.75. The beer pours with absolutely no head. Its light orange color with almost some pinkish hues. Smell is slightly fruity and a little funky. Each sip is delicous. At the start of the sip there is very mild fruit flavors, neither sweet nor bitter or even acidic, but towards the end a big clean hit of acidity and dryness hit the palate. Its not overwhelming and is quite pleasant. There is some nice light funkiness to go with some of the fruitiness. The beer is easy drinking and has a nice tingly carbonation. Overall, a fantasticly well done beer. No flaws, clean, and very drinkable. The complexitity, clean flavor, and overall feel remind me of a Hills Farmstead Saison."	4.59
4722	Gueuze 100% Lambic	750ml bottle. 1/18/17 bottle date. Appearance: Clear golden color with a pillowy white head and decent lacing Aroma: Strong funky brettanomyces character up front, lead by hay and horse blanket. A touch off grass, then the acidity pops up in the background, with apple cider vinegar notes. Taste: Starts with a light crackery malt sweetness before a bracing acidic tartness and bitterness, lemon peel, and light brett funk. Bready maltiness and brett notes emerge retronasally. Even some blue cheese Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied with a high carbonation Finish: Dry and surprisingly bitter, with a lingering acidic lemon tartness. Funky blue cheese is there retronasally. Overall: An amazingly complex beer. Brettanomyces dominates the aroma, and the flavor profile shows off the bracingly tart acidity. A surprising amount of bitterness here and the lemon peel like acidic bitterness/tartness counterbalances throughout. Very crisp	4.26
4723	Gueuze 100% Lambic	i am not a sour fan, which is probably why I can not appreciate this but it is just not for me. super light in look and feel, yet it tastes like I am sucking on a lemon.	2.67
4724	Gueuze 100% Lambic	"I have been scouring through my backlog, including some (mostly) bottles in my Beerfrigerator, an all-reefer with no freezer space. I had filled it at my parents' place, kind of ignored it, emptied it for the move to Chez Woody & then refilled it upon arrival. This one is going to be amazing! I pulled the cork & it is dated 1996.. From the bottle: ""Brewers of Belgium's Most Authentic Lambic""; ""Spontaneously Fermented Bottle Conditioned Methode Champenoise""; ""Aged and Blended Lambic Beer""; ""The world's classic Gueuze. A blend of one, two, and three year-old creates a second fermentation in the bottle. The champagne of Belgium.""; ""Store and serve at cellar temperature (50-55 F/10-13 C). Do not serve cold! Pour gently (leaving behind the yeast sediment) into a wine glass or traditional Belgian tumbler."". I had to both Pop! the cap & pull the cork until it likewise Pop!ped. Pop! Pop! I then began a very gentle pour into my awaiting glass until I saw the lees begin to move on the distended punt at which time I backed off. Color was a gorgeous Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity, enticing a visit from The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Croesus & Midas, all wanting a taste until ... The nose hit us all. Man, when they talk about a ""barnyard funkiness"", this is the phrase's poster child! Cheesy, sour, sweaty, funky, wow! I remember being off-put the first time that I tried Gueuze for this very reason, but now, I have come to embrace it. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium, not watery, but not terribly beyond it, either. That said, it was mighty carbonated, creating a pleasant effervescence in the mouth and on the tongue. The extensive aging had mellowed it from distinctly sour to a tickle in the hinges of my jaw, but the tartness was still as puckering as ever. The taste was musty and cheesy with a pronounced lemony sourness. I let it just kind of roll around in my mouth to allow the taste & smell to permeate my sinuses so as to create a pleasant memory. Finish was super dry, puckeringly tart & just what I expected from this gem. What a find in my cellar!"	4.32
4725	Gueuze 100% Lambic	375ml bottled 17 May 2016. Pours cloudy hazy amber gold orange with a creamy frothy white foam head. Smells like tart vinegary barnyard cobweb funk, some lemony citrus, woody cork, oak, apricot, grapes, apple skin, hay, toasty crackery malt, with dusty floral earthy herbal grass. Tastes tart and vinegary with some lemony citrus, apricot, grape, apple skin, big barnyard cobweb funk, woody cork, oak barrel, hay, toasty crackery malt, with dusty floral earthy herbal grass. Feels medium-full bodied, creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a really great gueuze.	4.93
4726	BDCS	12 oz can from Buckeyeboy. First Arkansas tick! Pours out black, tiny islands of tightly beaded bubbles. Oily and slick. Aroma is sweet, vanilla, chocolate, marshmallow, coffee. Taste mirrors the aroma, creamy and thick. Alcohol noticeable at the back. Smooth, tasty.	4.36
4727	BDCS	12oz can labeled 2019 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 10.3% ABV. The beer pours dense oily black with strong mocha head on hard pour. The head recedes to a half inch cap and leaves some lacing. The aroma is immediately noticeable after the pour with elements of chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The taste is semisweet caramel and roasted malt with coffee, vanilla, chocolate, oak and bourbon all popping through mid palate before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. No sign of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Very balanced and not cloying, yet luxuriously rich. Overall, outstanding. Thank you @russpowell!	4.59
4728	BDCS	Not the darkest pour in the world, but sits opaque black in the glass, with a super dense, mocha head. Smells like a freshly emptied bourbon barrel, which means a lot of the actual “beer” smell is overpowered. However, the flavors are much more balanced, and it’s scarily drinkable for over 10%. Like drinking a mountain of baker’s chocolate brownie batter. Bittersweet, vanilla, roasted coffee. Smooth as silk. Great stuff.	4.27
4729	BDCS	2017 version poured from a 12 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Jon! Bourbon and chocolate. Like a bourbon soaked brownie. Exceeded my expectations.	4.75
4730	BDCS	Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely malts with chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak and coffee just beyond. It has a sweet onset, and then fades slightly towards bitter. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat on the back of the nose, but is far from over powering. Flavor profile is deep and expressive, hitting notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, chocolate, toffee, and bourbon. Roasty, toasty, caramely malts add a firm foundation for the sugary notes. Dark and expressive. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture that carries just a touch of grittiness. Overall, dark and expressive, and yet far from overly complex or mind numbing.. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz can. 2019 version.	4.6
4731	BDCS	Good afternoon, NBS! Some yard work and additional gardening done this morning and now moving onto this one courtesy of. I’ve been shirtless in my backyard for most of the day. Neighbors haven’t complained of blindness yet, so I’m gonna keep this going as long as I can.. This beer is a “want” after seeing it reviewed around these parts. It’s a new state tick and a new brewery for me..  2,380 characters	4.61
4732	BDCS	Uhm, yum. Bourbon up front, bourbon in the nose, with a sweet, not cloying, aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full. Not warming, don’t taste the alcohol, but wow does it smack you in the head! I might revise my rating later when I’m not so smashed!	4.61
4733	BDCS	Given to me by @jvgoor3786, and damn, am I glad for that! This is a real great beer. To quote Monty Python, black as the ace of spades, he was, with slightly brownish/purple thinning edges. Had half a fingertip of quickly dissipating head that left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is a balanced mixture of bourbon barrel, chocolate, and malt. Well, maybe the barrel is more prevalent than the other two. On taste, however, it’s a lot more balanced between the three, with a little bit of vanilla and a bit of a fruity red wine note in there for good measure. Everything comes together-it’s sweet, roasty, and has a tangy, woodsy burn from the barrel. Feel is maybe where this outstanding beer is most outstanding. It’s big and bold from the barrel, but there’s some subtle silky smoothness from the malt and sweet adjuncts. Mouth watering and a healthy alcohol presence. The only thing I can say about it being ranked in the top 250 beers is that 172 may be too low. Thanks tons for sending me this one, Jason, and thanks to Ozark Beer Company for an awesome beer.	4.99
4734	BDCS	Heavy chocolate in the nose. Lighter in the taste with a fair amount of boozyness. That taste is not overtaken by the alcohol, but has a slight boozy feel on the tongue. The chocolate was subtle but tasty. Heavy but wonderful for the 12 ounce size can!	4.34
4735	BDCS	From can. Very dark brown-black color with a good bit of lacing foam upon pour which stuck around as you drank. Deep dark and boozy aroma. Chocolate, coffee, roasty and malty. Softer, medium-thick mouthfeel. Reminds good bit of BA Ten Fidy.	4.32
4736	BDCS	Poured into a snifter. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. Aroma was chocolate with roasted grain and coffee. Taste was chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and vanilla. Excellent beer.	4.15
4737	BDCS	L - 1/2 finger dense mocha head atop a motor oil body.. S - bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses, coffee, a hint of nuttiness, just a whiff of booze.. T - tons of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and coffee. Some barrel booze, wood, char, roast, molasses. Finishes with some smokiness. Low bitterness. Moderate-low sweetness. Moderate-low booziness..  463 characters	4.47
4738	BDCS	Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2018 vintage.. A -Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice oily black hue with a thick mocha head that fades to leave a creamy blanket and light legs.. S - Aromas of sweeter malts, super dark roast, nice fudgy chocolate but the barrel isn't super pretend..  699 characters	3.83
4739	BDCS	"Thanks to rudzud
Pours (with a vigorous pour) a large thick frothy creamy 1 fingered darker colored black beer, decent legs, but not a ton of lacing. Nose is super fudge dark chocolate roast, heavy heavy super dark roasted malts, dark fudge and sweet, a touch of dark fruits like a raisin, bit creamy nougaty, very light barrel and vanilla. Taste thick fudgey sweet candy, candy caramel nougat fudge and a little dark chocolate, cookie dough wafer, a touch of vanilla barrel like, little bitter roast, vanilla chocolate creamy ice cream, roasty bitter briny char thing that just destroys the finish, starts OK but ends really bleh, soy sauce like thing?.  787 characters"	3.86
4740	BDCS	"2018 can. Thanks Russ.
This was poured into a mini snifter.
The appearance was a fabulous looking dark thick black color. Slight film of a little eggshell white foamy head. Just a little bit of wispy concave lace.
The aroma captured a superb blend of roasty coffee bean, dark chocolate bittersweet character, sweet bourbon smooth woodiness with it's spice, some luscious dark fruits and a light sticky chocolate cake-like quality. Some
The flavor balances all of those prior mentioned aromas together in a semi-sweet fashion noting a sturdy bitterness and a prickling spice yet oh so good leveling to the aftertaste sweetly with a mellowing smooth roast.
The mouthfeel was between medium and full bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. No boozy heat as I thought would occur as many bourbon barrel-ed impy stouts tend to have, however, I don't see any dates other than the year so I'm not worried about it to be honest. Smooth semi-sticky finish with light cocoa powder-like slightly dry with bourbon finish.
Overall, to be able to obtain this beer from a stellar dude tells me wow - if I died tomorrow, I would be okay with that. If not, I may wake up with diabetes."	4.88
4741	BDCS	"Pours like motor oil. Thick pouring, pitch black. 1 finger tan head, and the retention is amazing. There's some lacing on the glass.
The nose really started hitting as soon as I cracked the can. I got hints of the barrel used to age this beer. Up close I get a deep, rich barrel aroma. Boozy smelling. Caramel, some vanilla.
Taste - Very rich flavored. The flavor has vanilla in it, some caramel. Strong notes from the barrel.
This is one very thick beer. Very rich feeling. Very boozy, but it's not a harsh alcohol at all.
Wow! I've heard about this beer before, and I see why it's so talked up - it is outstanding. This beer rivals all the other big names, and is just one solid beer."	4.72
4742	BDCS	Black and thick with a thin khaki head that disappears completely. A dominating smell of brownie batter with a hint of bourbon. Thick, deep, dark, decadent chocolate with a hint of roasted malt. Subtle bourbon and vanilla accents on the finish. World class!	4.69
4743	BDCS	The velvety chocolate and smooth bourbon on the nose and taste are reminiscent of a tootsie roll or double fudge brownies. The mouthfeel is thinner than it appears in the glass and is really the only slight negative. Overall a solid stout I would enjoy over and over again.	4.58
4744	BDCS	Viscous used motor oil black with a slow to build, super thick soft mocha head that retains well, settling to a thick blanket leaving spotty waves of lace.. Smell is dark chocolate martini with salty pecan, date, spiced rum and a roast that's like a soft brownie.. In flavor, accents of deep, dark charred oak with maple, toasted coconut and peppery bourbon add complexity to a fantastic base stout that exhibits luscious dark chocolate, roasted pecans and black licorice before a warming swallow..  599 characters	4.18
4745	BDCS	2018 can.. This one pours a very, very dark and motor-oil looking black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.. This smells like heavily roasted malt, marshmallow fluff, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, raisin, and coffee..  1,118 characters	4.53
4746	BDCS	Long time want. Traded a bottle of scotch for a 4 pack making this a ~$30 can after shipping.. 2018 can.. L - Teku pour. Very, very thin looking while pouring out of the can. Not what I was hoping. The head, however is is frothy, dense 1 finger milkshake whipped cream. Lacing is a little runny..  827 characters	4.14
4747	BDCS	2018 vintage (first time canned).. A: Pours a thick black with a thick cap of espresso-like tan head. Very good retention and minimal lacing.. S: Vanilla bean, sweet liquid dark chocolate, roastiness, and a bit of bourbon and cola..  694 characters	4.48
4748	BDCS	A huge hug out to scarysun for this minimalist silver 12 oz. can (2017). I’ve put up more ISO posts for this bastard than any beer I’ve ever hunted. And it’s here. I’m going to put on some Wang Chung & do a happy dance.. The pour is black with scarce visible carbonation. The nose is roasted & charred chocolate milk framed in soft barrel. Nice.. BDCS (Barrel Aged Double Cream Stout) is softer & lusher than any double-digit stout has a right to be. It’s like Almond Chocolate Milk served in a glass that was quick-dipped in bourbon. Slick & silky smooth, with a massive chocolate hit up front that overwhelms everything else until it begins to warm. Subdued notes of roast, cake batter (I love raw eggs), sharp cocoa before the bourbon comes in & settles in right above my happy place. This should come in slop buckets..  941 characters	4.28
4749	BDCS	"Received in a trade with @gibgink – thanks Dennis!
Undated can, stored at 42 degrees and served at 57 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 3.5.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque.
Head – Tiny (Maximum eight mm, aggressive center pour), brown, dense, poor retention quickly diminishing to a two mm ring and a very thin partial head.
Lacing – None. Not surprising for a 10.2% ABV drink.
First pour – Dark brown, clear.
Aroma – 3.75 - Roasted malt, dark chocolate, slightly burned coffee
Flavor – 4 - Starts slightly bitter with roast malt, dark chocolate, and, surprisingly, some dark fruit. The bitterness drops around mid-swallow and is replaced by an ethereal whiff of burnt rubber across the olfactory sense. Oddly enough, the burnt rubber is not displeasing but seems the natural end. No hops, no alcohol, no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 4 - Full, almost creamy, lively carbonation.
Impression and summation – 4 - Overall, a decent impy stout. Next trip through Arkansas, I’ll watch for it."	3.91
4750	BDCS	this is one of those beers of lore ive heard a lot about but thought i might never get the chance to try. thanks to my new homie who brought one out, my fantasy has become reality. i think its rare for beer to live up to crazy hype these days, so many competent producers out there and so much variation on cool themes, theres good beer everywhere and one thats surprisingly good is hard to really find anymore because the quality standard has come up so much across the industry. this definitely did take me by surprise though. shiny obsidian black from the can with a single finger of mocha foam and a huge nose of vanilla bean, sarsaparilla, and brownie batter. its thick for sure in the nose, dense, a lot to unpack. i get char too, lots of it, which introduces the barrel elements really nicely, more vanilla, sweet whiskey, and baking chocolate. the flavor is equally excellent, even more layered, with a lot of chocolate and vanilla to it, almost hard to believe it isnt loaded with adjuncts and that all of this can come from grain and barrel. i get more of the root beer thing, vanilla and like actual roots, a product of the oak im sure, but its awesome. heavy deep dark chocolate, high cacao, the good stuff, cant believe none is actually in here. one thing i love about this is how its still really bitter from the dark barley all the way through, and how it never gets too sweet. so many of these dont taste like stout anymore, and can be diabetic on the residual sugar, but this one actually finishes which is awesome. huge sturdy body, not too boozy even when it warms up, and slick and slippery going down. 2017 vintage drinking awesome right now, huge thanks to my new homie for bringing this one out, it definitely lives up to the hype!	4.38
4751	Temptation	Fido at share. Glad I finally got to try this, as they didn't have it on when I was down in Santa Rosa. Aroma and taste are Sublime, smooth light tartness, more if the Brett notes. Right in alignment with the way Russian River does these beers. Well worthy of its reputation	3.99
4752	Temptation	Effervescent gold, fluffy cap that settles into a persistent lace. Aroma has soft lemon peel, hibiscus, light loam, wet oak. Palate is features Brett tart upfront, more lacto sourness towards the back, distinct chardonnay note that really sets it apart. Undertones of oak, dry farmhouse yeast, citrus. Very good, maybe a smidge too lactic but love the chardonnay notes.	4.49
4753	Temptation	"Bottle. 5/1/18 bottle date. Appearance: Crystal clear, golden, with a low lying white head.
Aroma: Definite Chardonnay, Apple, and light pear. Lactic acid and light brett funkiness are pleasant.
Taste: Distinct white wine vinous flavor followed by some lactic acidity and only a touch of brett funk and hay on the back side. Nice tartness and bitterness to balance.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied withca high carbonation
Finish: Very dry finish. Apple and pear fruitiness linger with some Chardonnay notes
Overall: An amazing sour ale. The Chardonnay barrel adds a distinct vinous character, along with some fruity apple and pear ftombthe yeast. Brett and lactobacillus adds just a touch of funkiness and tartness to counter the fruitiness of the beer. Very light, bubbly, and refreshing"	4.35
4754	Temptation	2016 version poured into a snifter. A hazy golden color with a medium white head. Aroma was tart fruit. The taste followed but with a complex Bretty note. Overall a delicious blonde ale. Slightly tart and with complex phenolic notes. Outstanding.	4.43
4755	Temptation	"Pours a clear straw color, minimal head. Funky aroma with apricot, lemon, oak, and Chardonnay. Even tastes like a Chardonnay! Has a saison beer mouthfeel - funky, tart, sour, micro carbonation. Overall an outstanding beer.. 12/13/18
375 ml bottle dated 5/1/18 - thanks Adam!
4.75 rating"	4.54
4756	Temptation	12-4-18 - I’ve had this one many times before, but never on my bride’s 55th birthday. 5/1/18 bottle date in the RRBC caged and corked bottle. Yes, I poured slowly into my RRBC tulip glass and left just a bit in the bottle.	4.46
4757	Temptation	Yellow pour - great mouthfeel and amazing smell / lemons, citrus. Phenomenal Saison feel to this beer. Reminds me a bit of a dry Chardonnay wine. One of the best!	4.56
4758	Temptation	[Original rating 2015-01-01] Sours are not my favorite style, and I’m certainly no expert on them but this one is pretty damn good. Smells like a chardonnay and the first sip tastes like it too, but then you get the sour with the wine. Nice fine carbonation, good mouth feel.	4.17
4759	Temptation	Bright hazy yellow beer with low white bubbles. Smell of white wine grapes and some lemon acid. Taste betrays the 7.5% abv. It is light and tart and delicate with just a bit of bread to balance out the citrus. An undertone of saturated wet oak fills in where the malt usually is balancing the tartness of limes, lemons, white pear and of course sour white wine grapes. Balance is impecable; beer went down disappointingly fast. Finishes dry and salty. Overall very delicious, but not going to come back too soon considering the 15 dollar price point.	4.21
4760	Temptation	05/2017 edition poured at Toronado S.D. Pours a super clear straw color with no lacing and soda-like carbonation.. Aroma is of pure wine barrels and lactic acid. Lots of citrus and lactic acid.. Taste is familiar for a sour, but the barrel character sets this beer apart. Lots of dry white wine character and a slight lingering bitterness with some crushed aspirin notes..  526 characters	4.43
4761	Temptation	Pours a bright golden yellow, semi hazy with a billowy bright white head. Nose is wine like. Grape must, grains and fresh sawed wood (oak) Taste of grape skins up front. Tartness comes through in the form of the skins. Some light lemon zest, grasses and grains follow. A smooth oak wine barrel finish to it. Much like a white wine. Mouthfeel is medium to light at times. This beer finishes very dry and I mean very! It leaves you definitely searching for the next sip. Drank this at 10 months from bottle date. Have another one I am letting go a few years and I will report back.	4.44
4762	Temptation	Look: Pale yellow body, 1 finger white head.. Smell: Same as below.. Taste: Lemon, melon, grains, oak, mild barnyard. Maybe a hint of white grape..  222 characters	4.38
4763	Temptation	"A careful pour yields a slightly hazy gold with a two-finger pure white, dense and creamy head that persists and produces sheets of lace.
Aroma hits with the pop of the cork. Notes of Chardonay and funk right off the bat. Oak tannins, grape must, a touch of white bread.
A super dry sip with initial tartness followed by a drying bitter. Grape must, grape skins, tannins, a touch of sweetness and plenty of funk. Nice minerality.
Mouth is medium, bubbly and a drying. Give me another sip! Outstanding."	4.41
4764	Temptation	2015 Bottle, taster flight at Wades Wines in Westlake, CA.. Pours a light hazy gold, very much like a grisette in appearance. Thin creamy head, medium lace.. Mild aromas, getting hints of lemon to square out the funky yeast smells that punch through. Getting Brett-like qualities..  507 characters	4.28
4765	Temptation	"Bottle Date: 5/6/16
Palate Contaminants: other beer. Look is a clear light gold with a moderate amount of fine, white head.. Smell is a bit brett, a bit floral, a bit cilantro, and a bit plum blossom. It's an interesting combination. The word ""fresh"" comes to mind. It says chardonnay on the label, but I can't pick out anything specific to that wine ([from the future]: yet)..  1,012 characters"	4.36
4766	Temptation	Tasted from draft. Pours a very pale light yellow. Clear with some lacing. Aroma is Brett, lemon, citrus, funk. Taste is pretty bitter with flavors of citrus, sour funk, grass and herbal notes. I'll admit I'm not a sour fan but this is well done.	3.57
4767	Temptation	Shimmering clear gold with a moderate white foam that settles with good retention as a fluffy pillow leaving tall walls of cling. Temptation achieves level 10: infinite revival.. Aroma is light grain and corn, white wine and green grape, lemon, oak, light bright funk that's a mix between barnyard and hay-like brett and some other nice complexities.. Taste is brett-laden oak which is cut and brightened by white wine, orange peel, semi sweet corn and bitter hops that are difficult to describe but almost give off dank and pine notes with a hint of vinegar..  636 characters	4.13
4768	Temptation	Poured into a Pint Defiance tulip. The body is a golden yellow with a thin head. Aromas include lemon, brett, baked bread, and oak barrels. Flavors are the same. The feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, and is dry.	4.69
4769	Temptation	Caged and corked bottle poured into a stein, some lacings. Clear yellow, soapy white two finger foam cap. White wine aroma.  153 characters	4.25
4770	Temptation	In review is a 2012 vintage.. A - Dark gold color with thick white lacing, light carbonation.. S - White grapes, dry oak, citrus, green apple..  340 characters	4.11
4771	Temptation	Straw cloudy appearance with one finger white head that desipates quickly. Strong citrus aroma with a hint of sour apple. Plenty of carbination with sour apple and citrus flavor. Fairly dry.	4.46
4772	Temptation	I was lucky enough to score a bunch of bottles when I Was on vacation in the bay area in the summer of 2017. I stopped in, bought the bottles and got out. A beer like this would have been at least an hour wait in New England!	5
4773	Temptation	A careful pour yields a clear yellow color with a fluffy white head. The head has great staying power and leaves wonderful lacing. The nose is funk, citrus, white wine and a touch of graininess. The taste is raw grains and lemon up front, followed by white wine, funk and a drying oak. The sourness doesn't overpower things here, but is obviously present. The mouthfeel is very dry, yet with good body. Overall, it's a good sour that stands the test of time. The complexities I'm looking for are all present, but some are in greater aspects than desired. Still something I'll never say no to.	4.24
4774	Temptation	Pale straw colored,but it is mostly cloudy in complexion. There's a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and the vast majority of the top. The aroma is packed with chardonnay, oak, and lactic acid. I'm tasting mostly tart pear and then the brettanomyces kicks in during the fade and comes off bitter and tart. This is moderately carbonated,but oddly smooth for a wild ale.	4.3
4775	Temptation	"bottled 5-6-16; poured into a tulip. p- clear pale yellow/straw; 2f foamy white head; recedes to nice foam cap; lots of active carb
n- med-bold; crisp grainy malt, moderate funk, fruit, and white wine notes; apple; underlaying sweetness comes out after a few min; more funk in the nose than in the profile
t- chardonnay, tart apple, and lots of barrel; dry and fairly tart finish; no sweetness to balance it out, yet it works; light funk; crisp malt body carries the profile well; very little alcohol heat
mf- effervescent; light-bodied and crisp, with plenty of carb
o- this beer is solid; bold, yet drinkable; normally I'm all about sweetness, but I wasn't missing it too much with the way this wild was crafted; I don't think I've had another sour quite like it; very happy I tried it"	4.25
4776	Citraquench'l	Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Super hazed juice bomb our. Big fluffy white head leaves great lacing.. S: Citra hops. Fruity/tropical and citrus..  446 characters	4.5
4777	Citraquench'l	Amazing. This was my introduction into IPA's, and now I am hooked! I absolutely recommend this beer to everyone who is in Charlotte and loves good beer. All of Heist Brewery's brews are amazing though!! For sure one to check out!	5
4778	Citraquench'l	Canned fall 2016; drank 10/15/16 @ the Palace.. Opaque orange juice appearance.. HUGE white head; frothy lace..  299 characters	3.98
4779	Citraquench'l	Bought a crowler if this when I was in NC for a house hunting trip. Moving from CT I was anxious to try the best NC had to offer. It’s almost as good as any NE IPA from the classic stops. Well done Heist!	4.5
4780	Citraquench'l	"Thanks goes out to russpowell for this brew.. 16 oz. Can
Canned On: 11 14 2018. My first from this brewery..  798 characters"	4.37
4781	Citraquench'l	Enjoyed on draft at Smoke and Barrell bbq joint. Juicy, creamy, smooth...enter any adjective here and it applies! Throughly enjoyed this even though smoky bbq might not be the best pairing!	4.71
4782	Citraquench'l	"A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color and poured with a short white head that left lots of wisps of lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of grapefruit juice are present in the nose.
T: Like the smell, the taste has lots of flavors of grapefruit juice along with a touch of associated sourness.
M: It feels medium-bodied and very juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer tastes just like drinking ruby red grapefruit juice. It is very crushable.. Serving type: can"	4.4
4783	Citraquench'l	L - massive head atop a glowing orange body.. S - grapefruit, herb.. T - Mmmmm. Meaty hops. Brisket, cheese, garlic, fried onions. A little grapefruit. Low bitterness. No sweetness. Low booziness..  344 characters	4.31
4784	Citraquench'l	I unfortunately can't get down with 100% Citra IPAs much anymore (with the exception of Double Citra from HF - drool) - the overpowering qualities of cat pee dominate here; good to try though, and a great body for what it is.	4.22
4785	Citraquench'l	"From the tap:
Look: Golden orange color with nice 1"" white head; very hazy and opaque.
Smell: Hints of mango, orange, grapefruit.
Taste: Very tasty with hints of tropical orange/grapefruit, slightly dry with a little bitterness at the end.
Feel: Medium to heavy body; smooth and creamy. Lightly carbonated.
Overall: Probably my favorite newly discovered beer this year. Very drinkable and highly recommended."	4.67
4786	Citraquench'l	"Thanks to Mr. Beer_Economicus for this Charlotte beauty.
Pours a vibrant orange to golden hue. Opaque. Fluffy white head rises about 2 fingers in height. Scattered lacing.
Smell is bright citrus. Orange zest, floral lemon, and a fluffy oatmeal grain note. Very inviting.
Taste follows along. The flavor really does move in unison with the mouthfeel. The lite, fluffy delivery of such smooth citrus notes is quite satisfying. The finish is almost bitter, but definitely juicy.
Overall, a notable hazy. It is more nuanced hazy IPA, and I like that."	3.99
4787	Citraquench'l	On tap at the brewery. Get there EARLY to get a park. My favorite draft IPA to date, smooth and power-flavors with excellent finish. Great staff at Heist let me sample others without asking. Highest recommendation! Also got some 16 oz cans for my homeboys as I live 259 miles away	4.97
4788	Citraquench'l	Canned 07/06/18, so 10 days ago.. A: Pours a light orange, sort of orange juice like, completely opaque, with a third finger of off white head. Leaves some waves of lacing on the glass, with pretty good retention.. S: Fleshy orange, pink grapefruit, a bit of mango/guava, and very light grainy-ness. Very well constructed, though not exactly bursting with flavor..  789 characters	4.29
4789	Citraquench'l	Crowler, shared with friends on 5/26 - Citraquench'l pours a light, attractive yellow-orange. It looks a bit like Tang, actually, plus carb! It smells fantastic - sweet and full of citrus.. The taste and mouth feel are light and refreshing, with lots of orange and citrus. It's also fairly yeasty, chewy, and hoppy - though not bitter.. I really like this beer. This would easily be a go-to summer beer were it in my distribution.	4.58
4790	Citraquench'l	"Poured from a three hour old crowler. 
Pours a hazy yellow with two fingers of white head.
Smells of citrus, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, faint herbal notes.
Taste follows to a tee. Juicy sweet citrus balanced with a bit of grapefruit.
Medium bodied, super smooth.
Overall an outstanding beer. The best all Citra IPA I've had in awhile."	4.85
4791	Citraquench'l	On tap at Southern Grist. Bright yellow haze with a fluffy white head. Huge Citra aroma. All citrus and berries with no catty notes. The taste stood up to the nose. Great and bright citrus Notes with a faint underlying dankness. Bready malt. Just outstanding.	4.46
4792	Citraquench'l	A pale, murky, juicy looking beer with a nice light and sticky head. The nose is full of grapefruit, papaya, a tiny bit of green onion and pine. Sweet caramel, bitter citrus pith, grapefruit and pine. Finishes dry with a big pine aftertaste. Very good beer.	4.59
4793	Citraquench'l	Pours hazy orangeish yellow. Foamy, tall white head that lasts A while with good lacing.. Smells tropical, orange, light grapefruit, caramel make and papaya. Tastes mango, papaya, orange, tropical, melon and citrus peel. Finish is semi dry with a citrus peel and grapefruit linger. Medium body and creamy medium carbonation.	4.47
4794	Citraquench'l	Pours a turbid, peach-flesh like color with two and half fingers of white foamy head. Head forms eagerly even out of an 8 day old crowler. Lovely lacing left behind as well. Splendid start to the drinking experience. Aroma is tropical fruits - specifically, papaya, mango, and pineapple with a sweet marmalade note in the back. On the hop spectrum of bitter to sugary sweet, this lands at about a 60% sweet. Not overly so, but just enough to welcome a sip. Flavor profile oozes papaya, mango, pineapple, sweet marmalade, and peaches. Yeast is present, but just barely so, with a dash of biscuit malts in the back. The soft, slightly grainy, calcium-like feeling keeps this beer drinking smooth delivering those wonderful hop notes. It has a medium thickness that fills out the palate well without drinking like a meal. Overall, a sublime NE IPA. Loads of hop notes that remain well balanced. It is a touch sweet, but isn't overly so.. Served in a 12oz snifter from an 8 day old 32oz crowler.	4.55
4795	Citraquench'l	"L: cloudy, yellow orange, nice lacing, looks like a milkshake
S: citrus all over the place
T: very citrusy, with hints of apricots and melon
F: phenomenal mouthfeel, rich, creamy and juicy
O: fantastic beer"	4.09
4796	Citraquench'l	Hazy straw color with a slighly white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and slight hops that is very pleasant. Taste is also a grapefruit and slight hops that is very appealing.	4.48
4797	Citraquench'l	Poured from a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass.. Pours an orange-juice looking hazy body with a fluffy white head that reduces to a layer and leaves good chunky lacing.. Straight citrus on the nose, creamy orange creamsicle and dank orange skins. On the tongue it’s a burst of orange creamy dank hop notes sitting on a decent slightly sweet malt backbone. Easy mouthfeel low carbonation..  430 characters	4.63
4798	Citraquench'l	This is easily one of the best, most surprising IPAs I've come across in a while. Had this while I was in Charlotte and it was easily the best beer I had on my trip. Not to knock the rest of their beer, but this was by far their standout. I had it on tap and from a crowler a couple days later and it was just fantastic. Locally, it reminds me a lot of what Triple Crossing does in Richmond, but it was just better all around. Absolutely fantastic beer I hope they start making more readily available so I can trade for it. It's worth it.	4.82
4799	Citraquench'l	Appearance - Pours bright orange hazy with thick fluffy white head that lasts forever. Lots of stringy lacing all over the glass.. Aroma - Huge amounts of juice orange, pineapple, orange sherbet this things smells juicy and amazing.. Taste - Taste is exactly like the aroma tons of orange, mango, papaya and pineapple smooth with a tart grapefruit bite at the finish..  530 characters	5
4800	Citraquench'l	Fantastic IPA. Crowler filled on 3/3. Hazy/murky orange in appearance. So tropical on the nose and flavor. Just super delicious. Really glad to have tracked this down. Excellent brew!	4.59
4801	Barrel Aged Bomb!	"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a minuscule tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing
S: Smells of coffee, a little chili heat, hints of vanilla, oak, and some chocolate.
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee with some vanilla, oak, light chili heat, caramel, and roasted malts. On the swallow there's more chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and some slight lingering heat.
M: This beer has a fairly full and silky body. Carbonation is nearly absent but it works for the beer while the finish is on the drying side from the ABV.
O: Overall this is a fantastic beer. It has some great flavors and complexity which is heightened by the barrel aging. Alcohol is also well hidden as this one This is definitely a beer to be sipped and savored. I'd consider this one to definitely be one of the best examples of the style and definitely one to try if you can get your hands on it."	4.75
4802	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Picked up a 12 oz bottle from the Craft Beer Hop Stop7-24-19 for $12.99. No bottling date visible. Consumed 10/7/19.. Beer poured black and with an aggressive pour a nice tan head materialized before dissipating quickly.. Nose is light roasted malts and an ample amount of coffee, some vanilla, and a faint trace of bourbon..  789 characters	4.43
4803	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Good but not as good as Bomb. I wish there was more bourbon and the mouthfeel was thicker. Good flavors but a bit muted. Glad I got to try it but at this price point (9 bucks for the bottle), there are better choices.	4.06
4804	Barrel Aged Bomb!	L: Dark dark black - no head to speak of. S: Vanilla, milk chocolate and bourbon. T: Cocoa, Fudge, vanilla, oak, touch of booze.  258 characters	4.5
4805	Barrel Aged Bomb!	This is simply a fantastic BA stout!!! Bomb! is super well-balanced, but the barrel aging process seemed to really bring out the vanilla in the vintage we tried, which can be a bad thing if it's not good vanilla but this seemed like high quality stuff. Wish I had more	4.79
4806	Barrel Aged Bomb!	"It would be easier for me to talk about the things that I do not like about this beer.
1. They are not always available.
2. While they do not age poorly, adjuncts fade and I have found that I prefer them fresh. The chili fade is particularly noticeable when drinking an aged one next to a fresh one.. This along with a few other Prairie stouts is as good as it gets for me. I have had phenomenal offering from Bottle Logic, Goose Island, Ozark, and 3 Floyds. To me this stands toe to toe with them all."	5
4807	Barrel Aged Bomb!	"Reviewed on 4/29/16, from notes. L - Pours oily black no head.
S - I get lots of chocolate and vanilla with a slight whiskey smell.
T - Bomb, but tangy? Maybe it's the booziness coming through. A little bitter sweet finish.
F - Not quite as mouthy as bomb. A little thin.
O - Not better than the base beer."	4.21
4808	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Great mouth feel. Nice smell of booze and chocolate. Pours a nice dark black, very viscous. Mouth feel is nice and smooth. Chile and vanilla comes through nicely at the end.	4.74
4809	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Interested and curious to try this again. Because I remember the first time having this (in 2016) noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb! I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great. I've had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original. Kinda takes the point away to me, I guess. It's a solid treat nonetheless, but give me a regular Bomb! and I'll be good.	4.34
4810	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Smell: Initially I get a good amount of spicy green chillies. a lot of chocolate. Dark Chocolate, milk chocolate. You get some Barrel notes, Sweet vanilla, toasted coconut, smooth whiskey with a hint of oak. Also get some caramel and dark malts that come through as well.. Taste: This is a lot sweeter and Maltier on the palate. Right upfront I get massive amount of butterscotch, carmel, and chocolate syrup. The sweetness from the chocolate and malt carry through the beer. In the mid palate you get milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, and smooth medium roast coffee, almost like a cold brewed coffee in the way that it's not very roasty and it is extremely smooth. The beer finishes with a hint of green pepper spice, whiskey, toasted coconut, a kiss of oak and more of that Hershey chocolate syrup. As I mentioned the beer is sweeter on the plate which is really nice. The malty butterscotch sweetness lingers on in the after taste as you feel a nice lingering warmth in your chest. The beer also has a ton of chocolate which is awesome.. Feel: Medium bodied. A really nice creaminess, a perfect amount of carbonation, which helps the beer feel a little fuller, which is a good thing because the beer is on the thinner side for a Barrel Aged Stout. Still the carbonation and creaminess makes the beer just glide across your palete, which in turn makes this way easier drinking then it should be..  1,852 characters	4.68
4811	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Teku glass.. Pours a deep brown nearly black body with a one finger light brown head that reduces to leave a ring of retention and no lacing.. Aromas are heavy on the whiskey with some cocoa and vanilla. On the tongue is vanilla-cocoa fudgyness and coffee with a heavy whiskey backbone. Mouthfeel is rich and thick with low carbonation..  427 characters	4.34
4812	Barrel Aged Bomb!	From the bottle, it pours black as pitch as coal with virtually no head. Vanilla, bourbon and alcohol in the nose. The mouth gets the same and more flavors as well. Great flavor!	4.42
4813	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Every sip tasted different. But every sip was phenomenal! Never guess this was 11.2 ABV! So smoothe. Caramel bites really make it. Bourbon not too strong. The hint of vanilla. I'm in love!	4.65
4814	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Very dark appearance with minimal tan head. Aroma is a nice slightly sweet caramel with a touch of spice. Taste is also a slightly sweet caramel with a little spicy heat.	4.52
4815	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Bomb is an acquired taste for me, but the BA version is dynamite. It mellows out the heat from the peppers and adds a smooth barrel finish. This is really a solid beer.	4.23
4816	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.. A: Dark brown to black, and opaque. A thin tan head fades fairly quickly atop a low level of visible carbonation.. S: Really nice on the nose. Whiskey and chilis, chocolate and coffee. Sweet malts mixed with vanilla and oak. Notes of drying tobacco and toffee and Bit-o-Honeys. Awfully good..  1,505 characters	4.46
4817	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Poured into a snifter. Like most other big Prairie stouts, a black pour with a minimal tan head which fades to a ring. There is a pretty strong aroma- the Ancho chiles jump out at me, but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background. The taste is complex: there is a hint of coffee present, but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent, with caramel malt, vanilla, oak notes, and a touch of cinnamon following. The whiskey is extremely well-melded with the rest of the beer, and is present mid-palate through the finish. The chiles are somewhat muted, compared to the standard Bomb!, but provide a nice warming heat at the finish. The beer is full bodied, incredibly smooth the entire way through, and a touch boozy on the finish. Pretty incredible. Huge fan of Prairie's stouts, but this one surpassed my expectations and blew me away.	4.82
4818	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Viscous and opaque dark brown out of the glass. Prominent chiles and spices on the nose, with faint whiskey and cocoa. Not much coffee. The taste followed closely. Very similar to Bomb! but with an added dimension with the whiskey barrel. To their credit, this did not overwhelm the beer. Full-bodied and smooth on the finish. A nice improvement (hard to believe) to the base beer.	4.46
4819	Barrel Aged Bomb!	L: very usual jet black prairie stouts. No head.. S: delicious. Great bomb smell but adding in the extra whiskey.. T: bomb on steroids. Might be might first 5 here. I love everything about bomb but the barrel just adds more. Super chocolate..  286 characters	4.75

Pours thick from the bottle, like many Bomb! beers I've had. It looks almost too thick to generate much head, which it doesn't. A thin brown veil of bubbles fizzes away quickly. A thin rim does resuscitate and fade easily.. Molasses early, chocolate espresso beans with a hint of whiskey later. At times there's also a little cherrywood like tang.. Taste also has a little tang to it. The main flavors in this version lean a lot more towards chocolate than others. Maybe it's the notes from the barrel aging that bring it out a little more. There is actually a candy bar aspect to this with marshmallow and light undertones of toffee..  852 characters"	4.24
4821	Barrel Aged Bomb!	"Pours pitch black, no head and thick lacing on the glass.
Aroma has vanilla, peppers, oak, bourbon, spices, cinnamon.
Taste is cinnamon, vanilla, roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, oak, maple syrup-ish sweetness, bourbon finish with peppers that sits in for a long time."	4.3
4822	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Deep black but not as thick on the pour as I remember. Similarly, the nose has more chile heat than I recall. The palate threatens palate-wrecking spice at the outset, but it is beautifully cut by the bourbon. The pairing of sweet bourbon with hot chile works magically. This is, unquestionably, the best chile imperial stout I've tried to date. The chile's cutting of the bourbon also brings out the chocolate undertones of the base beer - tastes strikingly similar to Taza Cacao Crunch Stone Ground chocolate - the interplay of spice and dark chocolate is outstanding. Medium thick.	4.32
4823	Barrel Aged Bomb!	A - Pours jet black with a thin tan head.. S - Aroma is dark chocolate, charred oak and light whiskey.. T - The taste is dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, coffee and charred oak. The finish has a nice amount of whiskey barrel and some subtle heat from the chilis..  432 characters	4.44
4824	Barrel Aged Bomb!	Prairie's Barrel Aged Bomb!, whiskey barrel aged stout, with coffee, cocoa nibs, vanilla beans, and chillies. 11.2% ABV.. A: About half a finger of cocoa cereal colored head. Black in the glass. Very dark brown in the dimple; with a reddish edge. Solid sheeting; no lacing. Very faint inkiness.. S: Rich chocolate cake on opening the bottle. Light coffee. Just a touch of char. Dark toffee, oak, and leather in the back. Very much like a less sweet Birthday Bomb!.  1,121 characters	4.68
4825	Barrel Aged Bomb!	"Poured from single-serve bottle..... Initially flat and oily pour, but the head ""pops"" at the last minute to a two-finger tan. This may be the blackest most-opaque beer I've ever sampled. Impressive to say the least.. Aromas of coffee, cocoa, and vanilla notes followed by the bourbon notes. The alcohol is noticeable on the nose, but not offputting. Very ""stout"" aroma and lots of it..  1,137 characters"	4.7
4826	Black & Wild	"Not anything I want to try again, just not my cup of tea and if you put any other label on this beer besides ""side Project"" it would fall into the Tart of Darkness category. Happy to tick but nothing to write home about. sorry bruh"	3.44
4827	Black & Wild	8oz pour on draft at the brewery tasting room. looks dark maroon to dark brown with tan swirls. smells of sharp acidity, bourbon soaked cherries with a little drizzle of chocolate. taste is very light bourbon, rich acidity, sour cherries and chocolate maltiness. feel is full and somewhat more carbonated than expected but nothing to complain about. overall, the intense sourness is balanced quite well by the maltiness and chocolate flavors. such a unique beer. very glad to have finally tried this.	4.66
4828	Black & Wild	Was surprised that I got to try this beer. Batch 1, shared at the SP Brewery 1 year anniversary. Pours a dark reddish hue, with not a ton of carb. I didn't pick up on much more than the cherry on the nose. Flavor was pretty intense, which was a bit of a surprise given the age of the bottle. A nice robust tart cherry flavor on the palate. I didn't get a lot of the barrel, but that could've been from all the other insane beers I was having at the time.	4.38
4829	Black & Wild	One of the most unique wild's I've ever had. It is black, and it is wildly acidic and flavor packed. Flavor had a lot of oak, molasses, raisin, chocolate, sour cherry, and spice, and a perfect bourbon balance without being boozy ... didn't detect the vanilla. The nose follows the palate with the sour cherry really coming through, and the vanilla making its appearance. The mouth feel is what really stands out with this beer, amazingly thick syrupy smooth and long lasting with flavor on the finish. Amazing wild, amazingly unique! Must try!	4.74
4830	Black & Wild	Pours opaque brown with a small thin champagne like head. Has a chocolate type sour smell. Taste is incredibly well balance. Definitely get the chocolate and the cherry mid palate and finishes with a sour cherry finish. Well done.	4.77
4831	Black & Wild	"L: Dark mahogany and amber hues with a thin khaki head
S: Tart cherries, bourbon, and a bit of funk
T: Incredibly rich flavor profile - ripe dark sweet cherries, dark chocolate, charred oak, vanilla, and a boozy bourbon splash with some bite
F: Evenly carbed and smooth
O: I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this one, but it is a decadent, big, and complex beast. Delicious chocolate covered dark fruits and a bit of barrel make this a very unique drinking experience. Incredible."	4.8
4832	Black & Wild	I thought this was really interesting. Chocolate, bourbon flavor comes through, and ends sour. Think chocolate covered cherry dipped in bourbon. This was not overly sweet, but had a great balance. An exceptional beer that I haven't seen done before.	4.67
4833	Black & Wild	"probably the best dark sour I have ever had.
look is nice dark low carb
smell is nice funk with sour cherries
taste is funky cherries nice sour bite.
feel light in the mouth sour bite at the end."	4.93
4834	Black & Wild	Was lucky enough to have this one at the source! Enjoyed at Side Project Taproom with friends and this is one amazing Wild! Very complex and fruity!	4.65
4835	Black & Wild	Blend #2---poured into a HF Tulip glass,.... has some typical dark sour notes, cherry, chocolate, fig, all blending together... a fair amount of sourness, not enamel eating but definitely up there.... has a unique and long finish that differentiates it from other dark sours ive had... hard to qualify, almost chlorine-like but in a good way (sounds odd I know).... Very nice but not a huge edge over other more accessible dark sours.	4.29
4836	Black & Wild	Pours an inky black in the glass. Decent beige head. Smell is nuanced: roasted cocoa, vanilla, sour cherry, red grapes. Flavor is tarter than the nose suggests. Very vinous, fruit forward. Big, acidic finish but the chocolate malt backbone helps it along. The best kind of German chocolate cake.	4.49
4837	Black & Wild	Black and dark in color. So much jam. Jammy goodness. Sour and tart and goodness. Black berries and raspberries. Very drinkable. I'd love to have more of this one.	4.41
4838	Black & Wild	Pours dark brown with reddish hue and one finger head. Aroma is cherries, blackberries, some chocolate, vinegar, and oak. Taste is an explosion of dark berries and cherry skins. Tastes super tart and acidic like cherry and BlackBerry skins. Chocolate isn't prominent but adds complexity. I get hints of citrus and vanilla as it warms. Mouth feel is medium to full. Tart berries dominate here. The oak provides character and and dry finish. Unique and complex beer.	4.57
4839	Black & Wild	750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Black body with a huge khaki head. Nice looking. I immediately smell bourbon. Strong acidity and roasted malt. Maybe cherries? Taste is much stronger cherry. Intensely sour. Overpowers everything. Some roasted malt and a little bitterness, but mostly sourness. Well carbonated. Medium body. Flavorful, but overwhelmed by sourness. I get none of the barrel in the taste, though.	4.22
4840	Black & Wild	750ml consumed at Side Project.. Smell and Taste are: Milk chocolate, sour cherry, lactic, acidic, lemon peel, sweet caramel. Overall very lucky to try this one	4.57
4841	Black & Wild	Appearance: Pours the color of coffee capped by an inch or so of foam; some lacing action. Smell: Black cherry, chocolate, charred oak, caramel and Bourbon tones. Taste: Acetic sourness juts forward, with black cherry dominant; chocolate and caramel tones soften the acidity, with the Bourbon, vanilla and oak flavors building; incredible depth in both the sour and base malt flavors are highlighted in the finish.  551 characters	4.37
4842	Black & Wild	Batch #2 from a 750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Black & Wild has one of the most complex flavor profiles of any beer I have ever had. Sourness, tart cherries, and vanilla and oak from the whiskey barrel are balanced perfectly. Just incredible.	4.96
4843	Black & Wild	"L: dark dark brown, with some reddish brown at the edges. Like a very dark cola.
S: delicate in comparison to the taste. Oak, light char, tart black cherries.
T: one of the most complex beers I've ever head. Much bolder than the nose. Tart black cherries, oak, char all balanced. Tartness comes out on the finish and linger.
O: excellent. Very complex. Took half a glass before I could deconstruct the flavors."	4.7
4844	Black & Wild	750ml bottle. Batch 1. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass on 5/10/2015.. Appearance is pitch black. Perfectly contrasts with the Side Project lightbulb logo. Beautiful. Two finger brown head with appropriate retention time; disappears into a very thin collar, no film. No lacing.. Smells of tart cherries up front, fresh out of the fridge. It doesn't smell as sour as I was expecting it to be after one year in the bottle. Moderately acidic but not vinegary or lactic. After a few minutes, thick chocolate fudge comes out; literally like chocolate fondue. The cherries are still strong at this point, making for a nice chocolate covered cherry aroma. Oak, a bit of vanilla. The whiskey starts coming out more as it warms, as well. Smoky, sweet, robust whiskey; a nice complement, never quite emerging to the fore. Overall, to sum up the full extent of the aroma in one sentence- tart cherries covered in dark chocolate with a bit of vanilla essence and oak; mellow whiskey in the background. Fair amount of acidity, but not particularly lactic..  3,949 characters	4.74
4845	Black & Wild	A - Dark muddled brown and red coloring with minimal small tan head that recedes back into the glass. Nice retention here.. S - Cinnamon, Cherries, and whiskey dominate the nose followed by notes of funk and sourness.. T - Taste follows the nose with a blast of cherries that integrate well wight he tartness followed b notes of cinnamon whiskey oak and chocolate and vanilla all blend together from the 2nd use BA Abraxas Barrels.  2,077 characters	4.99
4846	Black & Wild	A- Pours dark brown with red tones around the edges and deep brown to black in the middle of the body. A small and bubbly head forms but doesn't stick around very long. Head is tan to light brown in color. Minimal lacing due to lack of head as you drink.. S- Tart cherries are big up front, providing a juicy, fruity, and sour start to the scent. Just a touch of darker scents kick in with a hint of whiskey barrel right after the sour cherry. Spicy barrel and vanilla sweetness are the main scents of the barrel. Wonderfully complex smell all around.. T- Starts off with a big sour cherry bang. Huge and juicy sour cherries preside over the front half of the taste before moving a little towards the darker flavors. Just a hint of dark malts are detectable under the sour cherry flavor, before the barrel character kicks in a little bit. Whiskey barrel spice and vanilla sweetness come in and compete with the strong cherry flavor, providing a little bit of balance. Ends with a lingering cherry tartness..  1,461 characters	4.37
4847	Black & Wild	A- Pours a murky dark brown/reddish color with a small tan head that recedes to a collar leaving some lacing.. S- The aroma is bursting with dark tart cherries, sweet malt, lacto sourness, brett funk, and oak! Super rich and complex, yet amazingly balanced and inviting!. T- Wow! This is just incredibly crafted! Bright sour cherry notes followed by tons of oak, sweet malts, even some chocolate. Mostly it's just tons of sourness, some lactic, some fruity. Some slight cinnamon and spiciness in the background Despite the warhead sourness this is incredibly drinkable!.  730 characters	4.76
4848	Black & Wild	Reviewing Black & Wild, a dark sour aged in an bourbon barrel used to age Barrel Aged Abraxas from Side Project Brewing out of St. Louis, Missouri.. Score: 100. April 2014 vintage bottle served in a stemmed Side Project Brewing bulb glass and enjoyed on 05/28/14. HUGE thank you to Ryan for sharing this delectable treat..  1,434 characters	5
4849	Black & Wild	Huge thanks to Mike for opening this on the evening of our law school graduation. Congrats, and thank you for your generosity!. Appearance is dark reddish brown, small head that reduces to just the tiniest bit of lacing around the glass, and a thin inconsistent film.. Smell is sour sweet cherries and spice from the barrels, melding together beautifully..  933 characters	4.74
4850	Black & Wild	Poured into a long stemmed Side Project tulip from a 750ml bottle.. Pours a nice black color with some mahogany edges and slight ruby hues. There is no head to be seen, as expected.. Wow. The aroma is intense cherry and vanilla notes. Completely acidic tartness can be perceived in the nose that almost singes the nostrils but in a good way. These notes are then tempered slightly by some mild sugary barrel sweetness that has some vanilla spice to it in the nose. As it warms there are TONS of sour cherry notes perceived in the nose. Tart, tart, tart with enough sweetness to slightly round out the sharp edges. Amazing notes of cherry and vanilla..  1,379 characters	4.65
4851	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"This has the look of motor oil
Smell of booze and little bit of coffee
Taste is more coffee and booze but not a bourbon bomb.. Still love this beer and feel like it’s a must try for any barrel aged beer fans"	4.31
4852	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Poured from a can into pint glass in October 2019. There was a canned on date of 10/14/2018 @ 17:45, so the beer had aged about 1 year.. Appearance: Very dark black with a thick dark brown head. Head was about 3 fingers high, and lasted a minute. It leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass, and ended with a thin tan head still on the beer.. Smell: Strong aroma of bourbon, with some coffee and cocoa. There is also some caramel, and some other sweet aroma like black licorice, but overall the bourbon dominates the others..  1,531 characters	4.47
4853	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Poured black at 53 degrees with a large mousse-like dark tan head; ruby edges; long cap retention; heavy ring and lacing; thin legs. Sweet caramel malt, bourbon, vanilla and oak nose. Bourbon entry with bittersweet dark chocolate right behind; toffee, oak, vanilla, bitter roast; not boozy. Medium body; smooth feel; moderate minus carbonation; minimal warmth from 12.9%; alcohol bite on tip of tongue. Overall, well balanced between sweet caramel/chocolate base, bitter roast, and barrel notes; pleasing bitter roast linger on the palate.	4.67
4854	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Solid BBA RIS. The cellared stovepipe can I had was from 11/10/17, consumed on 8/20/19. Good bourbon on the nose, not really a whole lot else. Taste has much more going on, pick up the burnt sugar and caramel notes along the way. Just wish the feel was a tad bit thicker and creamier. Overall, I'd put it just behind Parabola for non-adjunct BBA RISs.	4.42
4855	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Looks super dark black with some low amounts of carbonation - head recedes but bubble activity is still decent - great for a barrel aged imperial stout. Smells really sweet and rich - nice bite of bourbon and charred oak in the nostrils - chocolate/coffee/caramel/toffee/tobacco. Taste - just amazing - sweet and powerful at first without being over boozy with the 12.9% ABV - smooth and rich - first blast is bourbon and then chocolate and coffee flavors come in - sweetness burns off and more wood / campfire comes through with the barrel aging - vanilla and burnt dark brown sugar fade in here and there - very flavorful.  1,208 characters	4.83
4856	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	This is so damn good...Pitch black with a thin mocha head..good lace..I cant believe how good this is...Smells sweet with bourbon and roasty malt. Taste is out of this world..Might be the best Stout or maybe even the best BEER I've ever had..Body is like past due diesel motor oil...If it has bubbles, I cannot see them..This stuff is beer sex in a can.	4.67
4857	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Had poured from 19.2-oz. “stovepipe” can, bottom stamped “CANNED ON 10/29/18” and “DO A BARREL ROLL,” into 0.5l krug.. Although in balance with the other flavors, the bourbon displaces the hops from the regular Ten FIDY, so this is a different but still great and remarkably drinkable beer.	4.27
4858	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Appearance: Black with a generous-sized dark beige head that gradually faded. A good looking Imperial Stout. Smell: Mild Bourbon, roasted malt aromas, and mild brown sugar. I found the bal-aging notes to be fairly subdued. Taste: The taste profile features moderate Bourbon notes, dark chocolate notes, moderate tannic oak notes, and mild brown sugar. The taste profile is balanced with the bal-aging notes blending in rather than dominating as in other bal-aged beers. Very restrained alcohol presence..  750 characters	4.25
4859	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	For some reason it has taken me a while to warm to Ten Fidy, though I am well aware of its high reputation. Well, this BA version has really brought me around - it’s a very fine beer indeed. Black as night right to the edges. Wonderful, rich boozy nose, redolent with nutty, dark honey malts, a tangle of complex whiskey notes and almost stinging vanilla extract. The taste really fires on all cylinders, with the subtle, elegant power of a Maserati. The super charged whiskey is amazingly well balanced by a super strong malt backbone that ranges from honey through black molasses to traces of charcoal, dry bitter chocolate and just a hint of dried cherries. I had to move my rating for the feel up a notch - it’s really finely crafted. I can no longer deny it, this is a world class beer.	4.49
4860	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	First time with the BA version of my fave RIS. Obviously great in all categories. Velvety, robust with chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, roasty goodness, but the most pleasant surprise in the finish is a delicious almond note that goes on to infinity. Awesome!	4.73
4861	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a dense and rocky two finger tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with nice lacing
S: Smells of cocoa krispies, dark roasted malts, and some burnt sugars. There are some nice barrel notes in there as well.
T: Taste is smooth dark chocolate which turns bittersweet, nice dark roasted coffee, roasted malts, burnt sugar and creme brulee, vanilla, and oak. Swallow is more dark chocolate, espresso, roasted malts, smoky wood, and a little oak.
M: This beer has a silky and full body. Carbonation is not quite effervescent and adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish.
O: Simply delicious. Great flavors and complexity with a great appearance and a killer mouthfeel. Well worth grabbing if you see it as this is one decadent and rich beer to enjoy. I've had this one for a few years and it doesn't taste like it has fallen off any as well so these should hold up for quite awhile if cellared properly."	4.5
4862	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"Stovepipe 19.2oz can. Canning date of '11/14/18'. Entire contents of the can fit into the Spiegelau stout glass.
Opaque, black colored body. Less than one finger of tan head, which recedes back to an interrupted cap and high ring. Leaves behind a thick pattern of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts and bourbon barrel. Reaching in yields some chocolate and raisin notes.
Taste of rich bourbon barrel infused dark roasted malts. There should be dark fruit, chocolate, or coffee notes but these are deep reaches. This beer is really all about the dark malts and the bourbon barrel.
Thick mouth feel. Carbonation is rather flat in expression.
Totally awesome beer in that it expresses the main components of malts and barrel, without any additional tag along or added flavors. The beer is sludgy and deep, and this is enough."	4.59
4863	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"12.9% ABV!!!!. Poured into a large sniffer
Pours a thick black motor oil
This beer is Flat!
The nose is sweet and syrupy, nutty? pralines? raisins? oak? dark cocoa? maybe a little molasses?
Yes!
Mouth is actually pretty sweet and hides the higher ABV% very well
Can get really chewy if you let it adjust to room temperature. Only con:
The 1 pint sized can is a pretty big commitment for this beer.
Wish it came in bottles, so I can use a stopper and slowly finish it in 2 sittings!.  579 characters"	4.46
4864	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Canned just over 4 months ago.. Pours near-black with a persistent tan head with honey comb-like gaps.. The nose is dark chocolate, raisin, and a deep savory note. Awesome..  565 characters	4.57
4865	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"1 PINT 3.2 FL OZ. can
Served in a snifter. This beer pours black with a mocha head that leaves decent lacing.. The smell is caramel, vanilla, and cocoa..  481 characters"	4.12
4866	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Amazing stout. Pours black with a thick mocha head that dissipates quickly. Tastes of espresso, burnt sugar, and rich chocholate and caramel. Packs a bourbon punch.	4.43
4867	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"canned 11/06/17 consumed on 2/12/19. L - poured a used motor oil color with a 1.5 finger tan head that dissipated into a creamy tan lacing. 4.5
S - Roasted malts, bitterness, vanilla, the slightest of bourbon. This does not stand the test of time like bcbs. 3.75
T - Roasted malts, coffee bitterness, molasses, vanilla, would be lying to myself if I got barrel. This is still good, but I am missing the barrel. The flavors have melded well together and very cohesive. In a blind taste test, I would not call this a BA stout. 3.75
F - So rich creamy mouth feel. think coats the tounge and lingers nicely. A little to effervescent once the beer clears the palate. 4.25
O - Still a great beer, but I do not think this is a 'BA' stout anymore. It has melded well together and I would gladly drink it again, but think this is way better fresh. 3.75
3.85"	3.85
4868	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Tremendous. Regular Ten Fidy is one of my favorite stouts, and this just ratchets every positive attribute to 11.. Beautiful pour, amazing aroma, velvet mouthfeel, and so balanced and drinkable...just go find one already.. Only negative is this stovepipe can is nearly same cost of four 12oz regular Ten Fidy cans. I hope Oskar Blues keeps this available.	4.63
4869	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Canned on 10/13/18, pours out pitch black with zero light penetration. Poured aggressively it generates a modest amount of dark tan head, which subsides rather quickly. Smell is bold but balanced, roasted malts and slick bourbon aroma. I pick up tastes of bourbon, malts, with smaller bits of licorice and a curious tobacco note. Feel is nigh perfect, chewy and silky smooth as it finishes, no alcohol burn detectable whatsoever. It goes without saying that this is an exceptional beer, standing head and shoulders above it's very stiff competition.	4.64
4870	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	Can poured into a snifter.. Pours black with a thick mocha head.. Nose: roasted malt and bourbon. Pretty straightforward..  285 characters	4.51
4871	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"L - Deep, opaque black with a thin, dark tan head that dissipates quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - Rich chocolate, roasted malts, and slight hints of sweet bourbon
T - Rich fudge-like chocolate up front and throughout followed by notes of caramel and burnt sugar, vanilla, oak, sweet bourbon all intermixed well alongside roasted malt and barely. No hint of the 12.9%
F - Full bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth and rich
O - A fantastic bourbon barrel aged stout that has all the right notes, but honestly, I think I prefer the standard Ten Fidy."	4.44
4872	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"Really nice above average body with medium light carbonation.
Aroma is roasted malts and coffee as well as bourbon. Bourbon didn't come off sugary sweet in the aroma and the alcohol was very noticeable
Taste followed aroma almost exactly with the bourbon being there but not sweet or masking everything else. Coffee bitterness became stronger as it warmed which is easy to happen as its sold in large cans and is totally a sipper.
This is one that's worth a try, especially if you are in the mood to slowly savor a beer"	4.28
4873	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"Pours pitch black, impervious to light, nice mocha head. Big chocolate aroma, bourbon barrel, faint yeast. Big chocolate flavor, fudge,lots of barrel flavor, big bitter espresso finish that lingers.overall, very good BA beer. Drank 2017 & 2018 vertical. I liked the 2017 much more than the 2018, much more chocolaty.. 2/3/19
2017 & 2018 19.2 oz. and
4.5 rating"	4.44
4874	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	A deep, dark, rich barrel-aged imperial stout that took the best elements of Oskar Blues' Ten FIDY and made it even better! Pours a very dark black color, rich and thick and viscous, with a little tan head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, stone fruit, malt and caramel. Tastes similarly, along with some vanilla, roasted nuttiness, raisin, brown sugar and molasses. Smooth, sticky, viscous mouthfeel that was perhaps a touch creamy and good carbonation. Very impressive beer and definitely one to sip - though the ABV is high the warming alcohol doesn't hit you as hard until the beer warms closer to room temperature.	4.19
4875	Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged	"Black. Inky. Shiny. One finger leathery tan head.
Aroma. Malty. Molasses. Musty. Woody.

Body. Brutal. Carbonation. Enough."	4.28
4876	Mother Of All Storms	"2014 Vintage
22oz bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep amber brown color with some copper on the edges, one-finger foamy off-white head eventually disappears completely. S- classic english barleywine aromas; malty sweetness with bold notes of caramel, toffee, dark cherries, rum soaked raisins, figs, fruitcake, brown sugar and sherry. Earthy undertones of leather, along with a good amount of oaky bourbon that stands its own with the other aromas.  1,191 characters"	4.66
4877	Mother Of All Storms	"2017 vintage.
Pouring from a bomber into a PAA Dino tasting glass, this beer pours out clear and caramel on the downstream. It forms in the glass with much more darkness; I’ve seen stouts that aren’t as dark. A pinky width crown forms of butterscotch colored bubbles. 4.75. The nose carries in the warming bourbon along with barrel aspects of very dry oak, leather and dark fruit. Layers of sweetness show with fig Newton cookies, caramel and maybe slight molasses. 4.25. The taste brings thick caramel, like caramel chunks mixing with dark fruit like raisins, dates and plums while the strong background consists of the barrel notes of warming bourbon, dry oak and leather. 4.25.  1,043 characters"	4.28
4878	Mother Of All Storms	"Bottle Date: 2017
Palate Contaminants: none. Color is dark brown, with a tinge of red. Slight amount of head. Opaque after about half an inch.. Smell has lots of caramel. Plum blossoms, which is nice. Bits of anise. Moderate sweetness. Good intensity, all around, but as usual it should warm up first..  917 characters"	3.96
4879	Mother Of All Storms	2018 bottle. Pours black with a large light brown head that settles to a ring and leaves minimal lacing. Smells of oak, vanilla, bourbon and dark fruits. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel, figs, dates, toffee,raisin and a hint of chocolate. Full bodied. light carbonation, plush mouth feel, bourbon lingers on the finish along with mild dryness.	4.5
4880	Mother Of All Storms	2011 bottle poured into a snifter. A hazy medium brown color with a thin tan head. Aroma was whiskey barrel up front followed by sweet caramel, toffee, and faint stone fruit. The taste followed thankfully. A rich, smooth experience of caramel and toffee malt balanced by plum and prune notes, framed by a restrained barrel presence. Full bodied and just rounded. A bit oxidized but this did not detract. Phenomenal.	4.53
4881	Mother Of All Storms	Garnet-tinted dark brown with a half finger of short-lived tan head that quickly settles into a nice, soupy crown.. Huge toffee, some fig, raisin, leather and vanilla-forward bourbon in the aroma.. Sweeter fruit in the first sip than expected: huge cherry, plum, fig, raisin and a touch of apple. It’s joined by loads of toffee and vanilla bourbon. Rich caramel chocolate. A hint of coffee. A strong alcohol bite. Nice bitterness in the finish..  622 characters	4.4
4882	Mother Of All Storms	absolutely wonderful beer and one off of the long time wants list for me, who would have guessed it would take moving to idaho to find one?! in any event, its worth the hype and the years of frothing for one, a decadent barleywine experience with lots of barrel character, a ton of malt richness and layering, but not as over the top heavy and sweet as some of these can be, as it has a great maturity, lots of wood, some tannins from the oak, and enough barrel char and booze to keep it from being diabetic. pretty deep amber color with some head from the bottle, dense but not sedimented, and high shine in the right light. aroma is awesome, slight oxidation over sweet concentrated grain sugars, molasses and maple notes, some soy sauce, high end bourbon, vanilla, burnt wood, toffee, creme brulee, and a fruity mix of dried apple, raisin, and holiday fruitcake. the enormous alcohol content makes no effort to conceal itself either. the flavor has a ton going on too, sweet dates and molasses, a little more of the soy thing, lots of woody maturity and a ton of whiskey, vanilla and honey notes from it, some bitter char thats needed for balance here, and a whole ton of booze, but its warming me from the inside out in the most pleasant way. this is a monster, even if the body isnt as big as some of them, its a slow sipper and one to cherish and savor. i see why this has become sort of a cult following beer, its a prime example of the style and is wonderfully barrel aged. worth every penny!	4.26
4883	Mother Of All Storms	Look: Pitch black. One finger of tan head that quickly dissipates.. Smell: Sweet dough, chocolate, honey.. Taste: Sweet & sour dough and honey. There's a definite mild savory and sour note. Some bourbon flavor..  505 characters	3.95
4884	Mother Of All Storms	2018-11 bomber opened slightly chilled. Poured hard to a tulip, which after tasting, should really be a chalice. Aroma of vanilla and caramel can be smelled two feet from the glass! Color is mahogany / chestnut brown, with a two-finger tan head that burns down to a tiny ring with scant lacing. First sips are full of vanilla, caramel, oak barrel, malty barley. The bourbon is very subtle but stays present for awhile. As it warms, there’s a bit more bourbon bite up front and darker malt on the back...not cocoa type of malt. Slightly warming. Mouthfeel is medium, perhaps a little thinner than Id like, but overall very nice. Five more on a shelf, so we’ll see how time affects them. BWIL!	4.54
4885	Mother Of All Storms	2012: A little smokiness. Malty and sweet. Super good.. 2014: My very first My first Mother of All Storms - sweet and smooth.. 2015: A little sharper than 12. Malty and sweet. Still excellent..  268 characters	4.33
4886	Mother Of All Storms	Appearance: This beer pours an opaque black with burnt sienna around the edges when held up to the light. A light brown, two finger, fluffy head with tightly packed bubbles nearly disappears with a thin ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing on my snifter as I drink the beer.. Smell: The first thing to hit my nose is syrupy sweet honey right out of the fridge, morphing into toffee and caramel as the beer warms. Smooth bourbon notes of vanilla. A deep, dark bready malt profile with dark dried fruit aromas of raisin and some brighter plum.. Taste: This beer is beyond reproach. The malt profile of the Barleywine, the bourbon, and oak distinctly shine through as separate entities, all while melding to create the perfect marriage of flavors. It is the Mother of All Perfect Storms as these various flavors come together. This is not a beer trying to be something else, like so many are..  1,771 characters	4.6
4887	Mother Of All Storms	Pours a deep brown into the glass, and therein appears essentially black save for the translucent brown edges... A finger of creamy tan foam on top relaxes into a flimsy collar shortly after the pour... Aromas suggest bourbon-soaked dark fruits like plum, prune, raisin, and fig... On the sip, similar fruity impressions blossom, with a rich malt base and flavor elements of molasses and fruit breads drenched with booze... The feel is full, round and soft, with a little bit of chewy fruit under a light air of vanilla and dark whiskey.... This beer spent far too long on my wants list, but it was every bit worth the wait - one of the best English barleywines out there... Highly recommended...	4.71
4888	Mother Of All Storms	"A-Pours a very dark brown color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has a strong Bourbon hints and more subtle toasted malt, vanilla, toffee and caramel hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a generous bourbon flavor, and a more delicately balanced toasted malt, vanilla, toffee and caramel flavor
M-A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
O-The best Barleywine beer I have ever tried!"	5
4889	Mother Of All Storms	2014 vintage, thanks T! From a 22 oz bottle, pours an almost impenetrable deep amber. Small mocha-colored head looks very appetizing. Smell and taste are packed with toffee and plums, with just the right touch of barrel. Sips like a fine port. Delicious, the best barleywine I've ever had.	4.71
4890	Mother Of All Storms	This was just great, had everything one could hope for in a barleywine. Probably the best one I have had in a while. Put my name in for a case in November. We'll see !	4.66
4891	Mother Of All Storms	22oz Bottle 2011 vintage at barley wine tasting. Dark brown/amber with small beige head. Aroma brings in some boozy notes, sweet fruit, molasses, malts. Taste adds some of the woody barrel flavors, sweet malts, vanilla. Heat come sin late and stays for a while	4
4892	Mother Of All Storms	2016 release.. Whoa. Big chewy toffee mixed with cigar tobacco and a tall pour of smoky bourbon with faint notes of maple in the finish. My mistake was not bringing more back to the east coast. Perfect.	4.7
4893	Mother Of All Storms	The new rankings may be a little messed up because this should be a lot higher. Barleywine is life after all (BIL!). It is a great, smoothe drinking BW!	5
4894	Mother Of All Storms	"Vintage 2017.
Bourbon aroma is dominant with burnt sugar and figs. The flavor follows with caramel, dates, toffee and bourbon heat on the finish. Full texture with low carbonation. Outstanding."	4.43
4895	Mother Of All Storms	The beer pours out a dark mahogany/brown color, with 1 finger of fast disipating dark khaki colored head------------- the aromas are of fudge, whiskey, dark fruits, sweet chocolate covered raisins, Carmel and brown sugar------------- the flavors are of chocolate covered cherries, brown sugar, tart dark fruits, Carmel, molasses, vanilla and toffee, this beer has a thick & creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish------------- overall this beer was amazing, so much Carmel, toffee and dark fruit flavors, and for being 14% it was dangerously smooth-	5
4896	Mother Of All Storms	"Reviewed on 12/10/16, from notes
2015 bottle
L - This pours a dark caramel, almost burgundy color. Has about a one finger mocha head.
S - I get notes of brown sugar, candied dark fruits , smoke, oak, and bourbon. This is not tart or boozy at all.
T - The flavors are barleywine tang through and through. I love that! There is plenty of vanilla and chocolate in the middle. Finishes with a tangy oak, lots of milk chocolate sweetness. But, not sugary sweet like BCBBW.
F - This is super smooth and very well blended. Just a little dry on the finish.
O - Yes, it does have year on it. However, overall very drinkable. Well balanced, smooth, and masks the alcohol very well."	4.66
4897	Mother Of All Storms	Black as the starless night. Illuminated by the lightning strikes of aftertaste. In a rough sea of malty deliciousness shines the mother of all storms.	4.54
4898	Mother Of All Storms	"Opened a 2015 bomber and poured into a tulip glass. Carbonation does not create any head.
Definite bourbon notes on the nose that really comes forward as it warms up. 50 to 55 degrees is ideal.
Booze is fairly muted considering 14% abv.
Excellent barleywine"	4.6
4899	Mother Of All Storms	Got some 2017 bottles from the brewery. So far as I can tell, they haven't distributed this this year. At least not so far.. This is really great, BTW.. As I was excited to try it, and the bottles were somewhat cool when I got them home, I opened a bottle right away, and poured some into a small Teku. It was probably 10 degrees too warm, so I kept the bottle in the fridge and poured a little every 15 minutes as it cooled down..  2,581 characters	4.75
4900	Mother Of All Storms	2015 vintage poured into a tulip. Pours dark brownish red. Small tan head forms. Tons of dark fruit...raisin, figs, bourbon in the aroma. Flavor follows...LOTS of raisin and fig with bourbon. Delicious. Feel is med bodied. Not syrupy. Overall, phenomenal BW. Really like this a lot!	4.61
4901	Ghost In The Machine	Poured a cloudy, chalky yellow body with decent head and lace retention. The aroma is basically like pineapple juice, although one does get some tropical and citric notes as well. Thick bodied, smooth, at least for style, a hoppy bitterness lies underneath a tropical (less pineapple) sweetness and acidity that gives beer a sharp zip at times. Good balance, finishes clean and easy, and is a really enjoyable beer to sip on.	4.08
4902	Ghost In The Machine	12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/23/2019. Pours opaquely hazy deep golden/orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Amazing appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, wood, onion, light peppercorn/pine, wheat, white bread dough, biscuit, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, wood, onion, light peppercorn/pine, wheat, white bread dough, biscuit, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, floral, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, wood, onion, light peppercorn/pine, wheat, white bread dough, biscuit, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, lightly sticky, and slightly resinous mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol after the finish for 8%. Overall this is an incredible NEDIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Fantastic soft/silky feel for the ABV. Amazing Citra hop showcase. Extremely juicy, vibrant, and fairly dank/earthy hops; with a perfectly balanced wheat/oat/malt backbone. Light residual sweetness with lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding spot on style example. Loved the hop profile as expected.	4.28
4903	Ghost In The Machine	Very nice crisp hoppy IPA but a little disappointing considering the high ratings here. Bottled date 9/23/19 so I know it was fresh. Pours a yellowish hazy color with a thin cap of white head and some spotty lingering lacing. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple and lemon with some malt, floral hops and vanilla. Taste follows the nose, balanced and tasty and just a little juicy. Smooth, mild, slightly sticky mouthfeel and good carbonation. Well-hidden higher ABV. Tasty, just didn't impress me a lot.	3.93
4904	Ghost In The Machine	Pours out a beautiful hazy dark yellow. A finger of white head. Wow. It looks like pineapple juice.. It smells like pineapple juice too. Mild hop bitterness, orange, tangerine, pine, tropical fruit.. Flavor is pineapple, orange, lemon/citrus, tropical notes, pine, and some sneaky bready malt hiding underneath. The hop bitterness is there but never in the way. Never obtrusive. It doesn't detract from the whole experience. This is spectacular but in a subtle way. This is extremely well balanced. Very bright flavors just exploding onto the pallet without being overwhelming..  1,023 characters	4.6
4905	Ghost In The Machine	Beautiful orange-juice orange body; head is thick, dense, and very creamy. Lightly sweet powdered sugar aroma; mild citrus element. Huge biscuit malt backbone; light sweetness and grapefruit; very strong hop bitterness explodes midway into the sip and lingers long into the finish. Heavy body; thick and velvety; very dry finish.. This beer brings some incredible looks and mouthfeel to the bar. The flavor also hits big, especially with the hop bitterness. A beautiful and bold offering.. MANIFESTED ON 08/23/19 printed on the bottle neck.	4.23
4906	Ghost In The Machine	I got a 4pck of this from Publics during a trip I took to Florence, AL. It poured a hazy orangish with white head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had nice citrus tones. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tropical fruit peel presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.	4.16
4907	Ghost In The Machine	One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this brew. I can smell the hops in my dreams. This is truly the future of mankind. Anybody who thinks otherwise can shotgun a double smoked IPA from Evermoore for all I care.	5
4908	Ghost In The Machine	12 oz bottle. Pours very hazy golden, pillowy head dissipates to suds.. Smells of fresh citrus, hemp, zest, and cracker and cereal malts..  341 characters	4.24
4909	Ghost In The Machine	"From tasting notes 06/25/19
Had on-tap at The Phoenix at Westheimer in Houston, TX. Appearance - Served up in a pint, hazy and faded orange in color with a thin, broken layer of suds. Strong lacing with broken sheeting broken lines and spotting.. Smell - Citrusy and dank. Very citra heavy..  736 characters"	3.81
4910	Ghost In The Machine	I bought four packs. I drank the first with friends, the ones who enjoyed IPAs really enjoyed it as well. When I initially drank it, the taste of the hops was a bit overwhelming. I've been having the last pack in my refrigerator since February to see how the taste would change. Still has a very overwhelming piney and citrus taste expected of such a beer, but the hops have actually toned down somewhat over time, and I feel the beer is better for it.	4.75
4911	Ghost In The Machine	Serving: 12 oz bottle (“manifested of 06/11/19”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.. Appearance: Deeply hazy golden yellow with a short, lush head of white foam and streaky lace.. Smell: Layered aromas of citrus juices, tropical fruit and green onion dank..  700 characters	4.33
4912	Ghost In The Machine	Simply amazing. By far my favorite beer I've ever had. This is the beer that started it all for me. Parish Brewing has solidified itself to me as a 100% trustworthy brewery with Ghost in the Machine being their best that I've tried.. Look - This is the first thing that surprised me. A vibrant, cloudy orange color, very thick and beautiful.. Smell - Consistent with the look, the best way to describe the smell is strong citrus. It smells like if you cut open an orange or a grapefruit and sniffed..  1,293 characters	4.84
4913	Ghost In The Machine	What a great brew.. Hazy, unfiltered, hoppy with the right amount of juice. I love finding IPA's that are juicy but not considered a juicy IPA. Mild carbonation and a lovely hop finish, perfect finish.	4.72
4914	Ghost In The Machine	My rating averages the experience between fresh bottles and bottles that have aged a bit. There is a big difference between fresh bottles, and bottles that may have been stored appropriately (refrigerated) for six months. Fresh bottles are excellent, and would fall into my 4.5 range. Older bottles tend to throw a lot of sediment, and the flavor changes significantly for the worse. I'm drinking a bottle MANIFESTED ON 07/30/18, and I've got some major chunks at the bottom of my Nuit Belge Twenty Nineteen glass from New Orleans. I bought some more Ghost In The Machine in New Orleans that was MANIFESTED ON 02/26/19, and it is very good, just like my older batches were when they were (at most) four or five months old. I don't have enough experience to say when sedimentation begins, or when the flavor turns for the worse. But because this is a recurring theme, I'll caution you to drink when new and fresh nd enjoy. Later...not so much enjoyment is available.	4.13
4915	Ghost In The Machine	Poured into a tulip glass from bottle. Very fresh taste, citrus and hoppy. Aroma is outstanding. Pours a cloudy, straw color haze. Good head retention and silky mouthfeel. An outstanding double IPA	4.62
4916	Ghost In The Machine	"Poured a bright and hazy peach color with almost no head. Just layers of bubbles at the surface. Aroma is incredible! It is heavy in the citrus with bitter rind but then the vanilla comes in unexpected. This beer is almost like vanilla ice cream with citrus peel. Tastes like a milkshake IPA. Lots of citrus, sweet and bitter and then comes the vanilla and lactose. Also notes of mango and other tropical fruits. Slight hop burn. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Almost thick and sticky.
If it wasn’t for the label, I would have thought this was a milkshake IPA. Either way, it’s one of a kind. Wish I had more of this."	4.45
4917	Ghost In The Machine	"This is the worst beer I have ever tasted. Period. I have a point here, which is if you are over 100 IBU, please put it on your bottle! I didn't ever need to try this, I just didn't have an internet connection when I bought it and no info on the bottle. Absolutely disgusting to me and I was already well aware that I do not like this much hops. All you had to do was print some info about the beer other than your ideal description which just says it's a ""double india pale ale"". Newsflash: there are double IPA's with lower than 50 IBU. Thanks a lot, I almost gagged the second I even got a whiff. Complete waste of money."	1
4918	Ghost In The Machine	Found myself having a pint at the Bulldog in Baton Rouge back in August 2017. Brought a whole new level of craft beer into my life. I was able to get a growler fill after and since haven't had any but I am hooked and this is my GOAT! Wish I could get in PA....	5
4919	Ghost In The Machine	Pours a murky orange akin to a glass of orange juice. Head is a finger of rocky, white foam with fair retention. Aroma is orange, papaya, tangerine, lemon zest, melondew, and bready malts with a kiss of yeast. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, melon dew, lemon rind and zest, and mango. Big tropical fruits with zesty lemon. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a little silty, rindy, pillowy texture. Overall, zesty, sweet, and flavorful.. Reviewed on phone.	4.45
4920	Ghost In The Machine	"A: Pours up an opaque, juicy yellow orange, with a spotty, foamy, one finger head, with nice lacing.
S: This is a juice bomb, citrus, mango, peach, it's all there in the nose, in addition to the slight cheesy note that comes with the heavily dry hopped beers.
T: You are met up front with a nice touch of bitterness, before being brought into the thick juice flavors of this beer. Orange, mango and general citrus abound, even some pineapple, with some slight breadiness and a general sweetness.
M: This drinks like milk, it's thick.
O: It's an excellent beer, not as good as some of the NEIPA's I've had from Trillium, Other Half, and Bearded Iris, but still a damn fine beer. It's worth your time."	4.2
4921	Ghost In The Machine	Hop milk shake. Lots of citra so it has kind of a cat pee smell. I got use to it. I can only drink one at a sitting. Pretty good beer. Price is a bit high. 14.00 a 4 pack. Not worth it.	3.94
4922	Ghost In The Machine	Pours golden and hazy, citrusy aroma. It is much more citrus forward than I expected. I was imagining more tropical fruit, but there's a ton of citrus juice and rindy, minerally character. It is very good, but I can see why Nova Vert is more highly regarded.	4.24
4923	Ghost In The Machine	$7 for 14oz on-draught @ the brewery.. Aroma is all fruit juice, yogurt, and citrus.. Taste: A bit shallow and withdrawn, offering meagre citrus by way of a stale fruit juice flavour. 2-row and wheat are in there but it doesn't have a fresh taste or a clean presentation of flavour. I'm a bit underwhelmed, but it's pleasant enough...I did expect better given it's currently rated a Top 5 beer in its state..  618 characters	3.09
4924	Ghost In The Machine	Don't call people out for their reviews usually but in this instance I have to say Micky P missed the boat by a mile IMO. This is not my favorite style but this is my favorite NEIPA to date.	4.21
4925	Ghost In The Machine	Nothing special in this NEIPA. If you have had most NEIPAs done in the south you will not be surprised this is just the same as all others. Taste was off on the pour I had. I have had this three times now and simply not impressed.	1.87
4926	Leche Borracho	A 2018 release packaged in a 500ml bottle.. While filling the teku halfway, it is a viscous stout that produces a fairly frothy, brown head that not only has great retention, it never disappears. There is a constant film on top that tapers up to a thicker, cap sized ring around the glass.. First thing I can smell is definitely cinnamon. Tequila is also noticeable. To me it seems more like a white tequila because I tend to think it gives off more gin like floral notes. Otherwise there is a hint of a sriracha like pepper sauce, and chocolate..  1,594 characters	4.45
4927	Leche Borracho	Tasted from 2018 bottle. Pours black with faint light brown head. Aroma of peppers and cinnamon. Flavor is moderately sweet. Nice pepper flavor with chocolate and cinnamon. Just a faint hint of tequila that I wouldn’t have picked up without knowing. Some caramel and bourbon notes. Complex and extremely well done.	4.69
4928	Leche Borracho	Poured from fridge temp. Pours motor oil black with quickly dissipating brown head. Nose is amazing. Spicy peppers, bourbon, tequila, molasses, cherries, chocolate, lactose, and a touch of wood. Taste is insane. Peppery spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, tequila, bourbon, brown sugar, blackberries, cherries, chocolate milk. It's definitely sweet, but not overpowering at all. The aftertaste is really nice - a touch of spice and bourbon. Mouthfeel is super creamy and robust. Overall, an amazing BA stout.	4.74
4929	Leche Borracho	Bottle shared by Justin. Thanks man!. Thick black body with a small khaki collar. Huge aroma of cinnamon, cocoa powder, spirits. The flavor is incredibly complex, with each component integrated beautifully into the overall flavor profile. Smooth and silky on the palate. Lingering sweetness and booze complexity. Wonderful.	4.59
4930	Leche Borracho	500 mL bottle poured into snifter.. Near black with a thin mocha head.. Nose: bourbon, rich dark chocolate, undertones of cinnamon. Tequila is subtle and provides an added layer of depth without overtly smelling like tequila. Very complex and really pops..  493 characters	4.55
4931	Leche Borracho	It certainly had a lot of flavor, and it is a very good stout, but I thought it was too sweet.. Look: Black with a thin mocca colored head. Aroma: The aroma is very nice like a rum cake with raisins and chocolate, pepper and cinnamon..  510 characters	4.26
4932	Leche Borracho	2018 release.. A: Pours jet black with a ring and smattering of medium-light brown, fizzy head. Recedes quickly to a ring. No lacing.. S: Herbal (?) tequila, cinnamon, dark cocoa, spicy pepper, dusty oak barrel..  657 characters	4.41
4933	Leche Borracho	"On tap at the source. 2018 edition.
L: Pitch black in appearance. A tiny head that retained a tight khaki ring around the perimeter of glass. Actually get a little bit of lacing on the glass, which is commendable.
S: Aromas of cinnamon, bourbon, chocolate, dates, molasses, nutmeg and subtle milk sugar sweetness. Great smelling and not boozy.
T:Man this is unique. The thing that stands out to me is it is so flavorful even when cold. Tons of chocolate and cinnamon up front. The pepper spice is noticeable but it ins't overly done, just perfectly implemented on the finish. The lactose is prevalent as well, giving a milk complexity to the flavor reminding me of horchata. The tequila barrel is present on the initial profile but the finish is all bourbon. Fantastic.
F: Full in body, medium to heavy in weight. Nice smooth feel with decent heft.
O: An incredible offering from BL. I am super glad to try it on tap, and can't wait to see how it fares from the bottle. I am very glad to have tired. For the record, the wife approves of this beer (which is saying something as she isn't a stout drinker). Cheers!"	4.5
4934	Leche Borracho	Batch 2 (2018), poured from the bottle into an FO b3 glass. Pours a rich chocolate fudge with next to no carbonation. Nose is pepper, cinnamon, sugar, and chocolate fudge, with both tequila and bourbon barrel characteristics coming through but not dominating. Palate is full of fudge, spicy pepper, cinnamon, and sugar. As a big non-fan of tequila-barrel beers, I'm happy to report that the barrel plays well with the rest of the beer, and overall the flavors integrate better than I expected they would. This is probably my third-ranked tequila barrel beer, with PNC and Leche b1 being the top two.	4.48
4935	Leche Borracho	On tap at the brewery. Al lot going on with this one, but the flavors really played well together. A spicy aroma with cinnamon, peppers, and subtle tequila. They were all there on the palate but joined by bourbon and chocolate. There was a nuttiness from the combination. Nothing was overdone and each sip allowed a fun exploration of the flavors. Big hefty feel to support all of this. Outstanding.	4.59
4936	Leche Borracho	Had a taster at the brewery. Poured very dark with a sweet aroma of vanilla and spice and just a hint of chile. The flavor is extremely well balanced. The bourbon barrel and vanilla provide a sweetness that is well complimented with cinnamon and a bit of chile heat and flavor. The tequila barrel shows up in just the right amount on the finish.	4.42
4937	Leche Borracho	"L: Pours thick and a deep dark brown, almost black
S: Chocolate, tequila barrel, vanilla and a hint of pepper
T: Amazing how well all the addicts blend here to create a unique flavor profile. Chocolate, vanilla, barrel, sweetness and a touch of heat that doesn't overwhelm
F: Super thick with a bit of carb
O: One of the best beers that I have had. The balance in this is amazing."	4.96
4938	Leche Borracho	Black to flat marble mahogany with a dense mocha fizz that settles quickly to a sparse film and medium collar, then nothing, leaving behind only clear legs when swirled.. Smell blends charred oak and charred chilies to a point where they're indistinguishable from each other, and the chilies are near smoked chipotle levels. Smooth dark chocolate quickly mixes in, bringing plenty of cinnamon, a little vanilla nougat, almond, and a hint of strawberry.. Taste is chocolate chip cinnamon raisin cookies with a touch of sweet chili, red fruit, sweet vanilla and brown sugar. A hint of toasted graham emerges as it warms, as well as some root beer, with a little agave in the finish, but there is not much barrel present whatsoever..  769 characters	3.8
4939	Leche Borracho	500mL bottle from j47paco (thanks man!). 2016 release. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. Pours jet black with about two fingers of khaki head. The bubbles fizzle away quickly, leaving a small patch, narrow brim and only a few tiny specks of lace.. Aromas of vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, tequila, sugar and some vague spice..  816 characters	4.45
4940	Leche Borracho	Poured from a 500mL bottle into a bottle logic snifter. Acquired in a trade.. Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a light brown two finger head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a ring of foam and little lacing.. Aromas of sweet milk chocolate, cocoa, light cinnamon, vanilla-bourbon, and a very light booziness come through. Aromas are not overly potent but definitely reflect the ingredients..  868 characters	4.62
4941	Leche Borracho	Great spicy brew. Good mixture of barrel and heat. Thought this was one of the best BA spiced beers I've ever had up there with BA cake and BA oro negro. Really impressed how bottle logic's descriptions are always on point.	4.56
4942	Leche Borracho	Rich vanilla nose, chocolate, slight booziness to it. Big dark chocolate and cinnamon on the tongue, finishes with a slight kick. Definitely a well layered balanced beer, however I would have preferred a slightly higher bourbon profile on the nose and taste.	4.66
4943	Leche Borracho	Unfortunately, I rushed this taste a bit. Dark pour with a little tan head to it, this beer had a nice cinnamon backbone which ran from front to back, with the peppers adding some grip and texture. Well-structured and put together.	4.44
4944	Leche Borracho	Whether its a rich stout or an alcoholic malty, the line between dark ale and milkshake is a complete blur when the Bottle Logic gets ridiculous with their imperial stouts. Bourbon and tequila barrels, chilies and spice, sugars and chocolates- the entire brewer's pantry is on call with this massive beer.. Leche Borracho nearly crawls out of the bottle on its own upon a pop of the cap. As its rich and sultry darkness settles into the snifter, its milkshake comparisons are obvious. Black as night and rounding with a creamy tan lather, the beer's robust fragrance swirls around coconut and chocolate with hints of pepper, oak and margarita lurking in the recesses of scent. Lavishly rich, dense and robust in taste, its dark chocolates, espresso and nutty flavors settle on the tongue like brownie batter.. As the stout saturates the tastebuds, its sweetness holds on through the duration of the session and continues to balance the brunt of alcohol and chili spice. Sugary like chocolate cake, the beer's taste of heavy cream, vanilla and barrel caramel takes off the rougher edges of roast and has the beer feeling just as silky and malted milkshakes. Bourbon offers a bold coconut, char, vanilla, caramel and nutty taste that garners more attention nearing the finish..  1,500 characters	4.56
4945	Leche Borracho	Super creamy and thick, great mouth feel, peppers and sugar comes thru more prominently than other ingredients, more bourbon barrel flavor with a hint of the tequila. Overall very solid beer from bottle logic.	4.51
4946	Leche Borracho	"L: Deep black, with a tan head.
S: All of the intended notes are here. I get the peppers, cinnamon, cocoa nibs and bourbon. Tequila is less prominent.
T: A great blend of the above mentioned flavors. Everything you want out of spiced, barrel-aged stout.
F: I had this at the same time as FO and I found the mouthfeel for leche significantly better and what I'm looking for in an imp stout
O: I think Leche takes it place alongside the great spiced stouts such as Huna, Mexican Cake and Abraxas. Well done, Bottle Logic."	4.52
4947	Leche Borracho	There's a lot going on in this beer. Not only do we have the traditional Mexican chocolate treatment, but there's tequila barrels and lactose sugar thrown in as well. I was worried at first when this bottle gushed a little and looked weird in the glass. There were just a few large bubbles on the surface of the beer popping aggressively until they left without a trace. It also takes a minute for the aroma to develop, but when it does the boozy exterior gives way to inviting notes of cinnamon and dark fruit. Those dark fruits are a welcomed feature of this beer adding complexity on the aroma and taste. I think they're able to come through because the chocolate is not as forward as some other stouts in this style. I get some milk sugar and lots of vanilla in the flavor, but the texture isn't as creamy as you'd expect from a milk stout. The tequila provides a burn going down. When combined with the heat from the peppers and the spritzy carbonation, this beer seemed slightly off balance in stark contrast wit hthe other BL beer I've tried, Ground State. The mouth feel is adequate, but nothing special. The highlight of this beer is the excellent flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, dark fruits, and the unique blend of tequila that makes this beer a little bit different from the traditional beer in this style.	4.47
4948	Leche Borracho	This will be a classic grain of salt-type review, as the bottle was clearly compromised in some way.. Upon opening, this one nearly immediately exploded, it just poured out of the bottle- we lost half the bottle nearly instantly. Once in the glass, it was the expected dark black, with no head or lacing.. Smells like creamy dark chocolate, tequila, cinnamon, and peppers- this at least is nice..  1,008 characters	3.56
4949	Leche Borracho	Great Peppers and spices coming through on this. Awesome cinnamon and chocolate notes as well. Bourbon and tequila mixed together and you can taste it and it tastes pretty amazing.	4.58
4950	Leche Borracho	Mexican magic in a bottle big chocolate and spice with delicious sweetness from the Barrel to balance it all out. Just a delicious perfectly done barrel blend favorite spiced stout hands down no contest	4.98
4951	Clare's Thirsty Ale	"Pours black with a finger of mocha head.
Smells of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, light barrel.
Taste is dark chocolate, huge fresh raspberry, vanilla, barrel, dark fruits.
Full enough body, good carb levels.
Overall an excellent fruited stout!"	4.6
4952	Clare's Thirsty Ale	5/2/19 (Chicago): $12.47 12 oz. can prepaid purchase for January 2019 Haymarket brewery release, canned 12/28/18 and poured into snifter. Black pour, carbonation prevalent, tax head quickly dissipates living fine lacing. This release is 12% abv and labeled a barrel aged stout with raspberries. Raspberry aroma strong, nice balance with bourbon, overall sweet aroma. Taste mirrors aroma, raspberries are excellent, well blended taste with offsetting mellow but strong bourbon taste and roasted malt, tart cherry in the mix. Outstanding Stout! Slight fizzy carbonation, somewhat thin texture for a stout, nice and easy smooth drinking. Glad I poured this on a cold and rainy May Chicago evening.	4.59
4953	Clare's Thirsty Ale	2018 vintage (Jan 2019 release).. A: Pours a viscous black with a finger of dark brown, dense, foamy head. Excellent retention and some lines of lacing.. S: Dark cocoa and raspberry, cinnamon, bourbon, and oak, mild roastiness and a hint of anise. Very appealing and well balanced..  689 characters	4.2
4954	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Pours a shiny pitch black color. Thick velvety dark mocha colored head dissipates slowly and only partially. A good 1/4 inch of velvety foam remains on the beer. Thick, viscous almost fudgy when poured into the glass.. Aroma has notes of dark roasted malts, tobacco ash, hints of tart raspberry giving way to a warming bourbon and oak aroma. Notes of vanilla, dark fruits and some light earthy pine hop notes.. Taste has notes of dark roasted malts, a light tart fresh raspberry flavor with some piney hoppy notes on the back end. As the beer is consumed you get the bourbon, oak, charred oak and vanilla notes coming through as they warm the palate. the barrel character here is well balanced within the beer profile overall..  958 characters	4.46
4955	Clare's Thirsty Ale	I'm not generally one for fruited stouts - adjuncts in stouts should be restricted to vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, nuts, and whatever that isn't a fruit. But, Clare's Thirsty Ale was on the top 250 for years, so I had to try it.. Usually berry adjuncts come across as medicinal to me, except in sours - but this seems to be something of an exception. The raspberry is pungently present in the nose, but somehow does not have either a syrupy or astringent presence in the taste notes or mouth feel. There's also very low acidity to the berry, which is impressive - raspberry almost always imparts just a bit of acidity. Not so here, which is nice. The beer is fairly creamy in mouth feel, with loads of chocolate, and is quite smooth. No small feat for such a high ABV. There's definitely heat to the beer - I drank this on an empty stomach and found myself stumbling a bit. Oops. Still, not booze to the taste, just a bit of heat in the chest.. I see exactly why this beer is so respected. I think I actually prefer it over Jam the Radar, particularly as regards format. Pretty impressive..  1,173 characters	4.56
4956	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Pours an effervescent jet black with on finger of caramel colored head. So-so head retention & lacing, plenty of viscosity. S: Chocolate, rapsberries, figs. fades a touch once warm. Boozeyness then surfaces. T: Raspberry & dark chcoclate, raisins, roastyness & barrel dryness up front. More dark chococlate, barrel dryness & raspberry as this warms,a little raisin as well. Finishes with rapberry sweetness & tartness, a touch of breacing booze & barrel dryness, plus plenty of dark chococolate.  630 characters	4.2
4957	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Tan head. Black color. 2018 vintage.. Raspberry tootsie pop dipped in bourbon. Fudgy with raspberries and other berries showing. Light tartness, but not anything that makes it not stout like. On point with backyard and bramble rye. Full bodied. Really enjoyable.	4.5
4958	Clare's Thirsty Ale	32oz growler poured into a snifter. Pours deep black in color with a creamy khaki head that has decent retention. Smells of raspberry laced fudge, dark chocolate, caramel & vanilla. Taste follows the aroma, but the raspberry isn't as strong. It manages to pop through notes of dark chocolate with some jam-like notes. The finish brings out a hint of peppery rye and oak. Medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation, creamy mouthfeel and finish.	4.34
4959	Clare's Thirsty Ale	been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance. this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer, strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale, like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something, but this is anything but, and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one. a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries, and a wonderful one at that. i go back and forth on the fruited stouts, sometimes they get way too sweet and candy-like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars, but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this, so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities, its also really natural tasting, clean, and fairly acidic from their tartness. its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer. sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here, its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it, and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well, but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me. rye is a smart choice for barrels too, its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been, and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me. light vanilla too, but it isnt desserty so much. dark cocoa, a little bitterness, and whiskey, along with old school raspberry jam in the finish, its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be. this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel, but other than that beer, quite original. worth the hype!	4.34
4960	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Thanks Ryan for sharing a mini growler of this liquid. Poured into a tulip.. Aromas are luscious raspberry-chocolate, vanilla-bourbon. On the tongue is just straight silky semisweet chocolate covered raspberries that are ever present but delicately subtle. Easy, silky body, very thick and rich.. This might be the best raspberry stout I've ever had.. kills BYR.	4.69
4961	Clare's Thirsty Ale	2014 vintage (Woodford Reserve barrels) - very nice incorporation of the base stout, raspberry and barrel notes. The raspberry adds a nice sweetness and jammy notes to a really well done BA stout.	4.37
4962	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Always tough to balance fruits with barrel aged flavor but this one is harmonious. Huge fan of rye barrel flavors already so this templeton barrel is right up my alley though I am not a huge raspberry fan. However this works. Nose is literally a chocolate covered raspberries with subtle sweet rye barrel notes. Dessert beer start with a little booze barrel on the finish. Great beer.	4.73
4963	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Black thick beer poured into a snifter. Minimal carbonation. Lots of chocolate raspberry on the nose. Bourbon followed by the sourness of the raspberry but wonderful balance. A little thin on the mouthfeel but minimally	4.71
4964	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Glad I tracked down a growler of this!!! This turned out to be as good as everybody says! Hard to get! They need to bottle this beautiful Rick chocolate and raspberry BA stout!	5
4965	Clare's Thirsty Ale	"2016 on draft December 2016. Look - medium thickness with minimal head. Smell - straight raspberries and chocolate. Very little barrel
Taste - heavy raspberries. Very sweet, however, the chocolate mixes in nicely too. minimal barrel.  535 characters"	4.25
4966	Clare's Thirsty Ale	"L: Pours a thick onyx and mocha stream with a 1cm sandy head and moderate lacing
S: Dark chocolate covered raspberries
T: Incredibly decadent - silky milk chocolate, cacao nibs, and ripe raspberries burst on the palate; the barrel is well integrated and provides a substantive base for the beer
F: Medium thickness with a velvety/smooth mouthfeel and ample carb
O: Man, this is dessert in a glass and well executed. While the caliber of beer is on par with Backyard Rye, I'm not sure I fully agree with the comparisons given the different fruits/flavors. Nevertheless, this is an elite stout and probably the best raspberry stout I've ever had. Absolutely worth seeking out - hope they offer this for growler fills again in the near future. Cheers, Haymarket!"	4.79
4967	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Poured from a 32 oz growler into a snifter. Mild carbonation, dark brown with slight ruby edging. Big berry notes on the smell with mild barrel presence. Berry on the forefront of the taste, barrel is very mild. Smooth syrupy feel, alcohol is disguised well. Exceptional beer.	4.66
4968	Clare's Thirsty Ale	This is like a sweeter version of Backyard Rye. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night at a recent tasting. Certainly worth trying or seeking out if you are into fruited chocolate truffle flavors in your stouts.	4.58
4969	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Had a 10 oz pour straight from the tap yesterday. Looks like a standard BA stout with minimal head and pitch black. I can tell the base is a very solid BA stout, adjunct aside. This one isn't heavy on the barrel, and I don't love the idea of raspberry but it goes great this beer.	4.35
4970	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Haymarket is the type of place that I assume existed more commonly before the craft beer boom; a place that makes awesome beer, but somehow manages to stay under the radar (possibly due to how close it is to Au Cheval and every other trendy restaurant in the area).. Seeing this beer on tap necessitated a trip to Haymarket, since it's rare to get a chance to try the stuff. Pours a beautiful dark brown with just a hint of red from the raspberries (think of a beer mixed with wine). The nose is similarly fudgy with berries.. Really the only bad thing I have to say about this beer is that I wish it were a thicker beer. The taste itself is delicious, with LOTS of raspberry flavor for a beer this big, and the barrel treatment serves only to round it all out. Honestly, I'm not sure a thicker mouthfeel would help, because a large part of the appeal is just how much raspberry you get on the front end (which may be lost if the beer were thicker)..  1,235 characters	4.58
4971	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Huge raspberry, fresh dark chocolate, cocoa, light roast, sweet, some bourbon. Unlike the fruited bcbs variants, the fruit is super up front and not really integrated.	4.34
4972	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Phenomenal brew right here. Was lucky to get a howler of this divine beer. The fruit plays so well with everything. They need to bottle this beer someday please!!!	4.96
4973	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Huge raspberry nose jumping out of the glass. Tastes like chocolate dipped raspberry. There are vanilla and oak notes as well as some balance from the bourbon. The raspberry really shines here.	4.95
4974	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Finally got to tick this brew, during Haymarket's 5th Anniversary Party (I flew out to Chicago, from Delaware), just for the chance to try this legend. And it did not disappoint! Rich, lush, velvety, full-bodied chocolate raspberry stout, with excellent depth, body, and mouthfeel. And I got to meet Clare & Pete as well. Fabulous experience. If you like chocolate and raspberry in your stout, this is the best one out there, so go get some!	4.75
4975	Clare's Thirsty Ale	Look: Pitch black, dark khaki head that quickly dissipates leaving a bit of lining, medium carbonation.. Smell: My lord. A metric f***ton on raspberry (obviously), french vanilla, dark chocolate, a lot of bourbon sweetness.. Taste: The most fruit I've ever gotten out of a stout, even more than fresh BCBS Bramble. Super strong raspberry, a bit of roastiness towards the back end, decadent dark chocolate truffle, vanilla, sweetness bordering on playfully cloying, a bit of tartness. Jammy as f'. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't allow this to warm up and open up. Incredible..  758 characters	4.81
4976	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	poured into a taster glass via draft at Other Half's Pastry Town (3/16/2019). color is motor oil black with tan foam. smell is baker's chocolate and caramel.  425 characters	4.03
4977	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured a black body with dark tan head that quickly died with minimal lace ring. Smell is basically chocolate and that's not a bad thing. Smooth, creamy, tastes like chocolate icing off the top of a cupcake with a milky slickness as well. ABV is well-hidden in this slightly bready/chewy beer that is basically heaven for anyone with a sweet tooth, but not cloying and enjoyable for anyone who just likes a good sweet stout.	4.2
4978	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"L - pours a used motor oil color. Looks viscous. Beautiful 2 fingure dark tan head that gives way to some tan lacing.
S - I think this is the weakest part of the beer and it is still great! Milk, roasted malts and bakers chocolate, sweetness (coconut)
T - while this smells, and tastes like a dessert stout, it is not overly sweet and. First to hit my tounge is light sweet coconut and vanilla, quickly followed by bakers chocolate and dark malts. There a good milk flavor. The lingering flavor is sweet vanilla.
F - what you expect from a 10.5% lactose stout. Viscous, think, rich, coats the tounge very well. Not cloying.
O - this is great! I love that the adjuncts do not over power the base beer and they all complement each other very well."	4.57
4979	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"This one honestly elevates above stout and is in a class of its own. I realize there are adjuncts to this one..,, but they blend so well it tastes more like all the flavors are natural malt and yeast derived.
I’ve probably had 2,000 different stouts, and this one makes my Mount Rushmore."	4.99
4980	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	This...is...terrific.... Plain and simple.... Nailed the aromas and flavors of a big fudgy German chocolate cake... lots of coconut and dark chocolate... very very tasty....  202 characters	4.71
4981	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	2019 vintage. Released a week or two ago. A: Pours jet black with a cap of medium brown, espresso-like head. Recedes quickly to a razor-thin ring. Average retention and a few streaks and dots of lacing.. S: Loads of toasted coconut, an undertone of vanilla extract, nuts, a bit of dark chocolate and roast. The coconut dominates the aroma almost to the exclusion of anything else.. T: Again, just loads of toasted coconut with a bit of dark chocolate bar, vanilla, and light roast through the finish. Extremely sweet, though the sweetness works well enough with the flavors (even if it’s a bit much)..  895 characters	4.21
4982	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Appearance - The beer poured a big black inky black color with a deep mocha head.. Smell - The beer has a tremendous boozy chocolate nose. Far from hot, the alcohol lets you know it’s there.. Taste - My first thought was alcoholic milk chocolate. As things progressed, vanilla and coconut were noticeable. The coconut paired well with the coconut, keeping a sense of balance. The chocolate is lightly warming in the aftertaste..  615 characters	4.49
4983	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	07/2017 - dig the coconut, chocolate, lactose, vanilla aromas, flavors; incredible mouthfeel, per usual from AC; a bit sweet, but hey, it's quite yum!	4.56
4984	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Got this one from rutger this past summer. Cheers!. From a 750ml bottle into a snifter
Batch 1: 2018
ABV: 10.5% edition. APPEARANCE: Clear black pour yields a 2+ finger, fizzy looking, noisy tan head with lousy retention. Head fizzes down to a decent foam cap and then eventually to a wisp. Black body with minimal carbonation evident. A ring remains leaving falling lace down the glass as it empties..  1,325 characters"	3.94
4985	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Crazy though I may be, I actually prefer the non-barrel-aged bottle of Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout over the barrel-aged bottle.. This bottle, though not barrel-aged, is plenty rich and sweet enough - the chocolate to the nose and taste is thick and very pleasant, without any tangible heat from the ABV. It's quite pleasant without being too much in any particular regard, though it is tremendously sweet. I actually turned down pours of several other beers after drinking this one... my palate and my teeth just needed a break. So much sugar.. The Angry Chair reputation is well-deserved. They're crafting some particularly devious diabetes beers down there.	4.55
4986	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured from a 750mL bottle into an angry chair pint glass.. Pours a deep brown, nearly black opaque body with a dark brown smallish head that sticks around for a minute or so before reduces to a ring of retention. Spotty lacing.. Aromas are the epitome of a pastry stout - straight chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, cocoa, Hershey's syrup, rich chocolate truffles..  822 characters	4.56
4987	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of coconut, Swiss chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. It tastes of coconut, Swiss chocolate, creme brûlée, sugar, caramel, and vanilla. The feel is medium light, very smooth. This is probably the smoothest pastry stout i’ve ever had. The coconut really dominates, but an enjoyable beer.	4.54
4988	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"Deep black body with a brown head, huge lacing sticking to glass.
Coconut forward on the nose with lots of chocolate, caramel, cake alike.
Lots of sweetness in there, chocolate all the way, light bitterness, roasted in the aftertaste.
Mouth is lovely, it's like drinking a dessert, sticky and smooth.
Huge!!"	4.59
4989	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a dense finger and a half of dark tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of hte glass with minimal lacing.
S: Smells of chocolate and buttercream frosting with some coconut
T: Taste is coconut up front followed by a huge smack of chocolate, light coffee and roasted malt before some vanilla and sugary sweetness comes in hard. Saccharin sweet on the back end with more chocolate and vanilla. Swallow is more coconut, chocolate, vanilla, and sugary sweetness.
M: This beer is right about the middle of the road on mouthfeel that is just slightly silky but leaning toward syrupy. Carbonation is low but adequate for the style while the beer has a slightly drying finish that seems out of place but works well. You'd think something that tastes like it has this much residual sugar would not be drying on the palate.
O: This one lives up to the hype. Really tasty and decent complexity that makes this beer an enjoyable drink. Anybody got any insulin??"	4.75
4990	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	750ml bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours deep black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki head that has good retention. S- coconut is strong on the nose, as well as a heavy dose of chocolate & caramel, light coffee undertones.  669 characters	4.41
4991	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured from bottle to a tulip.. Pours pitch black, thick and oily. Looks heavy and thick. Pieces of coconut floating in the glass. Aroma is straight chocolate cake with subtle notes of coconut. Flavor is exactly as expected...rich chocolate cake and coconut. Absolutely decadent. Dessert beer at it's finest. Drinks thick....coats the mouth for sure.. This beer just does it for me. Likely one of the best non BA imperial stouts I've ever tasted. Just amazing.	4.94
4992	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Poured into a snifter. Jet black in color and viscous. It produced a medium-sized tan head which hung around for a while. A fairly potent aroma of milk chocolate, German chocolate cake, and spices. The taste was spot on. Silky-smooth chocolatey flavor with the spices described above. Impressively, this was not too sweet and seemed to have just the right feel. This is an amazing beer.	4.51
4993	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Dark viscous used motor oil black with a dark tan fizzy blanket that slowly reduces and thickens, specked with surprisingly large, thick white chunks, of...cocoa butter? coconut? Wtf?. Smell is sweet, decadent and indulgent, and it really hits the notes of the inspirational namesake. Chocolate, vanilla, and cake. Hints of fudge, coconut, nuts, and even cake batter...flour or egg or something, which, even though it's seductive, is very odd. I mean, it really smells like a coconut pecan frosted German chocolate cake...like wtf? I mean I didn't want it to be so good, to be honest...the Coffee-mate creamer beer trend has me questioning authenticity and ingredient usage--seriously, what's going on here? But, I just can't deny it smells delicious.. Annnnd on the tongue, IGCCS is rigoddamndiculously decadent and rich, with sweet chocolateyness all the hell over this thing and smooth fluffy vanilla cake notes. I also get a little mocha coffee and a hint of sweet, fresh coconut frosting. However, this beer is so insane that there's a cloying, throat coating Robitussin aftertaste long after the swallow...and because it's so sweet, you have to give it a good break between sips or else you're in for a sugar migraine, so it's inevitable you'll get this aftertaste..  1,415 characters	4.16
4994	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	"L: Thick mocha and onyx pour that results in a rich sandy head
S: Awesome nose full of dark chocolate, coconut, and vanilla
T: Decadent and flavorful - this beer simply nails its namesake; very sweet, complex, and robust
F: Medium to thick mouthfeel
O: Overall this was a fantastic stout. The BA version is one of my favorite beers of 2017 so it would stand to reason that the base version would be nearly as enjoyable. Highly recommended!"	4.83
4995	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Outstanding. Angry Chair makes some of my favorite stouts, and this is one of their best. Super decadent and just nails the taste - if you want to drink your dessert tonight instead of eating it, crack open one of these!	4.81
4996	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Pours a thick rich dark with a small tan thin head. Smells like chocolate and more chocolate. Got a little of the coconut but man the thickness and the chocolate cake mouthfeel were amazing. An awesome beer.	4.93
4997	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Copenhagen Beer Fest Boston. This one was wacky. Smelled and tasted like double chocolate cake. Chocolate syrup. Pretty amazing especially if this was brewed using minimal flavoring.	4.5
4998	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	Pours an inky black with a head that quickly dissipates. Nose is consistent with a chocolate cupcake - baker's chocolate and frosting. Taste is spectacular! Just like a boozy chocolate cupcake. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of still. Overall, really quite tasty. This beer would be top notch if it had a little more body.	4.31
4999	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	I've had just about everything from Angry Chair and this has been the best thing I've had from them. I'm a sucker for sweet and this is perfect. To me it tasted like drinking chocolate milk. Very smooth, no bitterness.	4.75
5000	Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout	drank in a snifter on 8/30/2016. L-pitch black, viscous, motor oil, minimal head, nice lacing. S-CHOCOLATE CUPCAKE!!! I can not get over how this truly smells like a cupcake. fudgy, chocolatey goodness. The smell is heavy dessert-like, but very impressive. I could not get over this to start to taste.  711 characters	4.75
5001	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Pours deep black with quite a bit of carbination. Aroma is sweetness of chocolate and milk. Tastes every sweeter with chocolate, milk, vanilla and some caramel. Medium bodied. An incredible stout.	4.5
5002	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	"L — Pours a deep black body with two fingers of surprisingly brown head produced with moderately aerated pour. Some retention and lacing
S — Aromatic coffee, milk chocolate, candied dark fruits, caramel, vanilla ice cream
T — Starts with a big punch of milk chocolate and coffee ice cream, then some light roastiness creeps in alongside some prune/raisin sweetness
F — Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. Has a nice fluffy dimensionality to it. The sweetness is present but not overbearing and makes it very drinkable
O — This one checks off all the aspects of a good flavored milk stout. Yes, everyone and their cousin is making something like this today, but this one shines above most of the competition. 88/100"	4.38
5003	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Obsidian black with a starkly vibrant dark brown foam that's tall and pock marked, collapsing quickly to a thin ring.. Nutty dark chocolate bar that's sharply sweet yet richly roasty is accented by floral tobacco that keeps it just shy of being cloying. A vanilla whip aroma emerges as it warms.. The silky moderately light body finishes lightly sticky.	4.02
5004	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	poured into a tulip glass via can dated 2/14/2019. color is a nice deep shade of brown. smell is chocolate, a dash of vanilla and faint burnt coffee.  355 characters	4.36
5005	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Can. Tan head. Lace. Black color.. Coffee, vanilla, and cacao. Coffee is a touch bitter. Not roasted. Sweetness from the vanilla. Smooth and creamy. Medium to full bodied. I enjoyed this more than the recent DS I had.	4.35
5006	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Tasted from can. Pours black with beige head. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate and vanilla. Taste is creamy and sweet. Lots of milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and coffee. Top notch milk stout.	4.71
5007	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	16oz. can into Night Shift stemware.. Nose is lactose, chocolate, espresso, roasted malt and molasses sweetness. Nicely aromatic. Beer opens with notes of chocolate, coca cola, molasses and lactose. More molasses and hints of roasted malt, vanilla and espresso in the middle with a heaping dose of sweetness. Finish is coffee, chocolate fudge and a sprinkle of roasted malt bitterness. Terrifically balanced. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation. Smooth and rich on the palate but with some playful bubbles going down. Sticky, messy, lingering finish.. This is impressive as ever. A fantastic example of the style..... but as a Tree House stout... just par for the course.	4.39
5008	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Appearance - The beer poured a jet black color with a mocha colored head.. Smell - The nose smelled of fresh sweet coffee. There was no bitterness here.. Taste - The nose was the clue that coffee would dominate the profile. Notes of malted chocolate, maple, and toasted marshmallow follow in the profile. The underlying current of coffee continued into the aftertaste. In every sense, this is a dessert stout..  590 characters	4.56
5009	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Picked-up six cans at Tree House brewery for five dollars and five cents. Canned-on date of 2/14/19. My thirty fourth brew from these guys. Known for IPAs, but don't sleep on TH stouts. This, like every other I have had from them, is outstanding.	4.5
5010	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	L - black body, two fingers of dark brown head. S - SO much chocolate. Coffee, caramel, marshmallow. T - Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate. Marshmallow Fluff, Cherries, black coffee.  227 characters	4.64
5011	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Appearance: Pours double chocolate fudge colored with a one finger tan head; shards of lacing linger. Smell: Roast, dark chocolate, caramel and coffee with a hint of vanilla. Taste: Mocha forward, with dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee tones; caramel sweetness filters in, through the middle, while the coffee aspect lingers into the finish.  502 characters	4.25

Pours a thick, opaque pitch black with a thick, creamy brown head that settles to a tight little cap. Decent retention; confetti lacing. (4.25). S:
Smooth cocoa powder, vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate, candied nuts as it warms up a little. (4.5).  1,357 characters"	4.54
5013	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	"Can poured into a treehouse snifter, opened 12.20.18
Black motor oil liquid, one finger brown foam cap that quickly recedes
Aroma of chocolate, fresh roasted coffee, whiff of vanilla
Taste is fresh roasted coffee without the hard bit e or bitterness, milk chocolate, hint of vanilla
smooth with no bite
Delicious beer, repeatable"	4.65
5014	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of sticky lacing.. This smells like intense candied coffee aromas, caramel, ice cream, dark Belgian chocolate, maple, and milk chocolate.. This is probably the best non-Good Morning stout that I've had from Tree House so far. The coffee flavor is intense, but velvety and rich. There's lots of vanilla in the coffee flavor, but also a touch of maple and caramel as well. There's a touch of roast of roast to keep it perfectly balanced..  739 characters	4.66
5015	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Brewed on 12/7/18, picked up at TreeHouse on 12/8. Tasted on 12/11 Cold straight from the fridge in a TreeHouse Teku glass it looks good not an overly frothy head once it settles down, has a good rich look, no light gets through, not as flavorful as other TreeHouse stouts I've tasted and at 7.9% alcohol you can begin to smell the alcohol esters like you would an Imperial Stout even though they call this one a Milk Stout.	4.37
5016	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is liquid French toast: cinnamon, vanilla, coffee, and cocoa. Medium-heavy bodied, sweet, with medium-low carbonation. Every time I do not think Tree House can out do itself with a stout, they make another great one. Do not know how Nervous Energy can be any more French Toast than this. Exceptional stout.	4.96
5017	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	"Acquired in a trade. Poured into TH snifter with maximum foam head. 4 finger plus.. Look: Deep black, well blended. Perfect foam building head that lingered for days.
Smell: Toasted s'mores, chocolate, orange, fresh cut grass.
Taste: Marshmallows on the fire, cedar, cinnamon, maple, ash, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, lactose, brown sugar.
Feel: Incredibly smooth, but the aftertaste presents a slight plastic note.
Overall: Phenomenal stout. Again. Extremely enjoyable and drinkable."	4.74
5018	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	beautiful looking beer.. aromas are a mellow roast hinting at earthy coffee flavors, some creamyness and chocolate invoking a hershey bar. on palate this is a deep complexity in the chocolate character, some milky chocolate blending with slightly bitter bakers chocolate. roasty coffee notes and mellow fruity acidity blending with a creamy vanilla flavors almost reaching marshmallow status. some burnt malt notes, earthy quality, and hint of caramel. while the flavors are rich and robust, the mouthfeel ends up being a little light - medium minus and not overly chewy, still a nice smoothness to it though, keeping it very drinkable.	4.57
5019	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	An outstanding milk stout, but it didn’t carry the depth I was expecting... did a base beer really well, but didn’t incorporate the adjuncts to the level I expect from treehouse.	4.52
5020	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a chocolate and coffee blend. Taste is a very pleasant chocolate and coffee blend with a slight vanilla touch	4.48
5021	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	"Canned 8/15.. A: Pours thick black with a cap of medium brown, moderately dense head. No lacing and average retention.. S: Milk chocolate, moderate medium roast coffee, a hint of liquid caramel, and vanilla ice cream.
T: Tasty coffee, milk chocolate chunks, vanilla, with moderate sweetness and roast though a medium-length finish..  468 characters"	4.3
5022	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	Poured from fridge temp. Pours like thick viscous oil. Looks creamy and oily with nice tan head. Nose is milk chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and some roasty notes. Taste is super smooth and balanced. Slight bitterness with a nice sweet layer. This is how a stout should be. Nice notes of nuts, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, licorice, and a bit of toffee. Definitely some dark fruit on the aftertaste. Maybe blackberry. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, which is impressive given the lower ABV. Overall, a very impressive stout that is worth seeking out.	4.4
5023	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	I don't get this obsession about stouts. They just quite simply are not that good and often overdone. This one is OK, maybe better than OK. I like the tones of chocolate espresso, but it is just too much for my taste.	4.26
5024	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	"Appearance: Very dark color, pours well with a thin head that slowly fades
Smell: Roast Coffee, Dark Chocolate, Cocoa, Molasses
Taste: Solid caramel and mocha blend with coffee backfiller.
Mouthfeel: Creamy feel with even carbonation. Overall: Very nice milk stout with good flavor balance and super enjoyable to drink at the brewery itself!"	4.54
5025	Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known	A malty chocolate chip cookie with a hint of caramel, chocolate syrup, and molasses. A little vanilla and milk chocolate on the finish. The Tree House stouts are pretty dialed in right now. Really enjoying this one	4.42
5026	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"Fresh from the brewery.
Light brown reddish and pinkish color with a thin head.
Sour aroma with notes with of raspberries, cherries, lemon, cranberries and some residual mild sweetness.
Flavor with notes of cranberries, raspberries, cherries, red wine, bold spices, yakult, salt, some vinous funkiness, mild vinegar and caramel. Dry, spiced, and bitter aftertaste.
Medium body with perfect carbonation. Alcohol of 7% is very well hidden.
Flemish Red Ale with bold notes of red fruits with good acetic complexity and peppered with salt and spices."	4.16
5027	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"750ml corked bottle from the LCBO, served from the fridge. Best before date: 02/07/2020
I went into this so excited to try this beer. The look was a beautiful dark pink colour, and it smelled like a great combination of berries. That's where things went sour, literally. I know that this type of ale is supposed to be tart, and I was expecting that. Two other beer lovers tried this with me, and we all felt similarly. It tasted like red wine that had gone to vinegar. I have tasted balsamic vinegars that I would prefer to sip. I am hoping that I got a bad bottle, but I fear that it wasn't the case. It felt like it was well-brewed, but the taste was frankly revolting, and I have had some bad brews in my day.
100% disappointed."	2.03
5028	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"75 cl. corked bottle from Las Buenas Pulgas. Served at home in a tulip glass. Pours a kind of red colored-fuchsia, small head that vinishes almost before you fill the glass, no lacing.
Aroma of red fruits, nuts, fruit stalk, tarty, some barnyard.
Medium to full boyd, creamy texture, n ormal carbonation. Dry acidic finish.
Taste is similar to the aroma.
Absolutely great and complex. And Excelent aperitif."	4.76
5029	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Poured from fridge temp. Pours dark brown. Nose is cranberry juice, sour, and sweet. Taste is dark fruit, juice, a bit of syrup, and sweet. Really nice, but this had a few years on it. Might be better fresh.	4.06
5030	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"750 mL Bottle. ABV 7%.
Appearance: Very slightly veiled cherry red, A half finger of beautiful soft pink head which dissipates quickly, low carbonation.
Aroma: Raspberry, Strawberry, Cherry, Cranberry, Yeast, Funk, Fruity syrup, Sweet.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, Slightly prickly, Semi-dry, Noticeable carbonation.
Flavour: Sour cherry, Tart, Raspberry, Cranberry finish, Dark fruit juice, Vinous, Yeast/Funk, Slight vinegar, Insanely balanced.
Overall: If you have not had a beer from Rodenbach - change that. In my humble opinion, they are THE name in Flanders Reds. Their beers are unbelievably delicious, complex and balanced. They are also highly consistent. As the name suggests, Caractėre Rouge embodies ""Red""."	4.44
5031	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"If this was one 330mL bottle, maybe I could tolerate it more. As is, the sourness affects the teeth and gives acid reflux to regret. Too much.
Looks and smells great but I wouldn't try again."	3.28
5032	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Poured a copper-tinted reddish body with fizzy carbonation but no head or lace. The aroma is sour/tart and chock full of cranberries and cherries along with some razzies and oak. Excellent balance between tart cherries, sour/sharp cranberries, some raspberry sweetness and an oaky smoothness with no booze and a filling body.	4.18
5033	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	What an amazing color!!..a semi-cloudy light strawberry color with a quickly disappating light pink head. Aroma is full, so full. of strawberries, light cranberries and sweet cherries. Taste has just a light touch of sourness from the cherries and a great balance of sweetness in the form of cherries and raspberries. Yeast and Belgian feel is so light and makes this beer so so drinkable at 7%abv. The tartness lays on the tip of the tongue and does not overpower the goodness of the main ingredients. Finish is incredibly refreshing and has a great feel of fresh beries throughout.This one is a winner !	4.2
5034	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Bottle 3 of 4. Finally getting down to reviewing this legendary brew. Cork and cage 750 ml bottle and cost was a mere $8.70 CDN. Probably should've picked up another half dozen of these. A fine way to conclude Canada Day! Served cold into a chalice.. Appearance - Light pink or red in color. Capped with a tiny off white head. Good clarity. Looks the way its expected too.. Smell - Tart... very tart with raspberry and cheery and of course some balsamic vinegar, but this is a more robust fruitiness than Grand Cru. Very inviting..  1,618 characters	4.67
5035	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	750ml bottle corked and caged poured into a speigelau ipa Glass. A: Small slightly off white Soapy head that quickly settles to a film. Body is a burnished copper, brown leaning toward amber with fairly good clarity.. S: Lots of berry flavors strike you raspberry and strawberry and a lesser extent of cherry..  620 characters	4.27
5036	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	I waffled about this bottle on many, many occasions - that $25 price tag is hard for me to justify when I know that I'll likely be drinking the bottle along. Please, Rodenbach! 500ml bottles! or 12 oz bottles!. Obviously I bought it anyway. And with that out of the way.... Poured in to a 10oz flute - Caractere Rouge takes a bit of time to warm and open up. As it does so, the oak notes become more and more prominent, as does the tartness of the berries. And? It just gets more and more awesome. It has a delicious fruity taste and mouth feel, much like a traditional framboise, with the addition of cranberries and cherries. This is nothing like those cherry fruited beers that take on that awful cough syrup taste and aroma. It's incredibly complex, with those dry barrel notes and tremendous juice and berry flavors. It's not mouth-puckeringly sour, but it's certainly quite tart..  1,006 characters	4.59
5037	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	This is it - the ultimate sour beer I've ever tasted. So dangerously drinkable - the sourness and the fruitiness is in perfect balance and harmony. I put this beer down so fast that I did not stop to admire all the nuances of the beer. This beer is great for those moments of introspection and quiet reflection - if you can rein in your urges, which I sadly was unable to do.	4.75
5038	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	(corked 750 ml 2013 bottle, split between two tulip glasses). L: reddish-tawny liquid, slight haze; active foam erupts on pour, falls away to stillness, bubbles rise up around glass. S: gummy candy, berry jam, bit of a vinegary note... softly fruity-perfumy, pleasant intensity.  993 characters	4.42
5039	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"Is Rodenbach the world's best brewery, Belgian style at least? This is simply sensational. I drank this out of my handy Garre glass from a 750 ml bottle I kept outside in the low 50's. The beautiful red color bubbles to a quickly vanishing light fizz emitting an earthy, fruity aroma my 4yr old child described as ""rotten fruit candy"". The taste is fresh fruit (but kinda Faygo Rockin' Rye!) followed by oakiness and that delicious Flanders red base. An Earthy tart dry finish. This is showing off just how sophisticated ""beer"" can be. Sublime, complex, wow."	5
5040	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"Vintage 2013.
Bright ruby red, beautiful beige head, long standing.
In the nose a lot of berry fruit (raspberry, blueberry), woofìd notes, tobacco, vanilla. A light note of cherry stone.
Then flowers (violets). A light fresh tartness, then tovìbacco and leather. Great.
Godd balnce in the taste, between sweetness, fruitiness and controlled sourness.
Great drinkability, long and dry finish, with fruity notes, and leather/tobacco."	4.25
5041	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	#1,000 for reals this time. I’ve been squirrelling so much anticipation, ewe wouldn’t even believe, but bear with me - this is a massive milestone, let me crow about it [animal puns: success!]. 7 years ago I posted my first review on beeradvocate.com, and in that time I’ve had many many great beers, and in the last few years less and less crap beers. TBH I realised life is short there are too many beers out there for one man to drink (and review) so I’ve been sticking with the “good stuff”. Rodenbach Caractère Rouge: good stuff I’ve heard, plus I already love Rodenbach Grand Cru, seems like a no brainer. No, it isn’t my usual “what’s the BIGGEST (ABV) beer I can get my hands on”, but let’s give something different a go (yo!).. Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.. A: Cloudy red fruit coloured body with a nice tight-packed salmon-tinged head that slowly dies back to a thin lace ring. A stunning seductress: “the coyote of the desert likes to eat the heart of the young and the blood drips down to his children for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and only the ribs will be broken...” mmm. 9/10..  2,669 characters	4.45
5042	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. 2013 dated, Best By date on bottom of bottle is '05/09/2019'.
Reddish amber colored body, cloudy appearance. White fizzy head settles back to healthy ring fed by bubbles. A few spots of lacing but most slide back into body.
Aroma of sour cherries, raspberries, with the sour cranberries in the background. Also there is vinous red wine and oak tannins.
Flavor has both sweet and sour, but the sweet is a little more than the sour. The sour takes hold more toward the end. The sweetness is more fruity than sugary. Cherry, raspberry, and cranberry blend and mix together very well. Later in the taste profile is a leather/earthy component which does not last into the aftertaste. Also present is the oak barrel.
Medium, dry mouth feel.
This well done beer does not let the sweet from getting too saccharine, nor the sour from getting too puckering. Well suited to match with strong cheese or savory cured meats and sausages."	4.59
5043	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Red/amber/lite brown pour; quick thin white cap, but lace sheets the glass to the last drop; medium thick legs on swirl. Intense sour cherries, red wine nose. Tart juicy cherries with acidic bite; red wine, plum, currant fruit flavors with lite toast malt backbone. Medium body, acidic tingle on tongue, lite and crisp; dry tannins-like wine feel. Overall, World Class; sweet fruit finish notwithstanding sour cherries/fruit flavors; smooth complex fruit and red wine notes; no bitterness or vinager flavors; simply awesome.	4.85
5044	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Happy New Year! Aged for four years. Easily one of the best fruited sours I’ve had. The aromas explode with cherry, raspberry, and cranberry, with a nice musky earthiness rounding it out. There is a prevalent raspberry/cranberry tartness in the flavor, but it is not nearly as overwhelming as most American wilds. The four years of aging in the bottle have mellowed out the gently sweet malts and alcohol presence wonderfully, and the result is an immensely smooth, silky, bright palate. Complex, fruity, estery yeast character. A very special ale, as it should be at ~$25/bottle.. 93/100	4.63
5045	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Appearance - The beer poured a beautiful ruby red color with an off-white head. Carbonation was visible.. Smell - The nose was a bomb of fresh raspberries.. Taste - A lot of raspberry came to the front. The initial impression was followed by cherry, vanilla, and oak. The cherry and raspberry intertwine to become indistinguishable. The aftertaste is slightly soured, but overall well-balanced. Sweet and sour linger..  579 characters	5
5046	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Exceptional vessel of deliciousness, mouthfeel is a champ and the leathery tobacco notes were there along with exruptions of fruit. This is fine craftsmanship to the Nth degree. This bottle was cellared for 2-3 years and I think that may have dried it out just a bit. Devine Devine.	4.76
5047	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	I was lucky enough to find the 2013 locally on close out. $5.00 a 750 ml bottle! I bought 2-6 packs. Delicious fruit forward sour. Had some with a little dark chocolate, very nice.	4.45
5048	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	"Brouwerij Rodenbach N.V. ""Rodenbach Caractère Rouge""
750 ml brown glass bottle, corked and caged, and coded 23 02 18""
$22.99 @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ. Notes via stream of consciousness: Not much of a pop upon opening, and then not much of a head whilst pouring. I guess that secondary fermentation in the bottle just didn't happen. It's a cloudy, almost brown color with just a thin collar of white. The aroma is fruity with notes of raspberry and cherry, and a little bit of Graham Cracker, and that carries over into the flavor. There's some oak as well but it's limited, at least in comparison to the fruit, and there's a touch of golden to medium caramel and a subtle note of chocolate as well. It's not tart but there's a light acidity to it, giving it a slightly metallic edge, and the softer carbonation works really well - perhaps it's intended to be like that. The very fine bubbles gently bristle the tongue, and the acidity lends it a hand, but at the same time it remains very soft and easy to drink. I'm a little bit torn in that it's not more intense, but at the same time so refined and sophisticated that it's hard to argue against. It's obviously a world classic, the question is where does it fall in the line-up. Well worth seeking out."	4.56
5049	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	Reviewed from notes. Poured from 750 mL bottle into a Hunahpu snifter.. A: Dark red - almost magenta – with a thin light pink head and lots of visible carbonation. Quite hazy.. S: Tart and sweet cherries, tart cranberries, dry oaky tannins. Somewhat vinous but the lactic character dominates. Nice but not outstanding on the nose..  1,115 characters	4.33
5050	Rodenbach Caractère Rouge	A - Pours a beautiful ruby red with a three finger fizzy white head. The head dissapates quickly leaving some soapy lacing.. S - Aroma is sweet and tart cherries, raspberry and oak.. T - The taste is sweet and tart cherries, cranberry, raspberry and brown sugar finishing with some nice oakiness..  427 characters	4.47
5051	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Super excited to try a BA version of one of my favorite beers, let alone a maple barrel version! Smell takes on more of the flavors from the original: cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, hot peppers, cake breadiness, black strap molasses, slight dark fruit and smoke, plus then the bourbon and wood from the barrel, maple is there but faint. Not as pure smelling as original, but heavier. Taste is incredible, so much complexity, take all of those aromas from the smell, add smoky maple, caramel, and rich malt work. Finish has good kick from peppers, plus counters the sweetness and robust barrel well. Feel has the spice, has deep richness, has robust barrel elements, sweet adjuncts, and some graininess too, just so much goodness. An amazing beer, apparently I rated the orignal higher, but honestly for me they are equals, just depends on your mood	4.68
5052	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Westbrook tulip glass. Allowed to warm over an hour.. Pours an opaque black body with a one finger dark brown head that reduces slowly to a ring of foam and leaves no lacing.. Aromas are sweet and inviting - vanilla-bourbon and milk chocolate, rich maple syrup, bittersweet cocoa. Habanero peppers in the background..  1,113 characters	4.7
5053	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Dark cola with a mocha head that quickly recedes to an ever-present ring with no lacing. Thick heavy alcohol legs coat the glass when titled. Aroma is bourbon, maple syrup, and chocolate. Taste is sugar, big time chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, and habanero in that order. It is very complex, and the flavors compliment each other instead of conflicting with each other. There is a long lingering peppery burn which makes this beer standout to me in comparison to Hunahpu’s and Abraxas. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and coating. Overall this is an absolute treat. I love the base beer, but the Maple Bourbon barrel treatment makes an amazing beer world-class.	5
5054	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"I found this variation to obviously be of the same commendable quality as ""plain"" BAMC, but a bit sweeter with a touch more raisin. I didn't really get the smoky, caramelized maple flavor I was hoping for, but hey, can't complain about getting another version of barrel aged Mexican Cake. It still has that distinct spicy heat with a slick, thin body that finishes semi-dry."	4.13
5055	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.. This smells like sweet dark maple, pepper spice, cinnamon sticks, chocolate fudge, oak, and light bourbon.. The maple is super strong here, even without a ""direct"" addition of - these must have been wet barrels. There's a touch of the underlying bourbon, and some nice oakiness, too. The pepper does a lot of work here, adding a tingly spiciness that helps balance out the heavy maple sweetness here. The cinnamon adds a sticky candy sweetness, too. I don't get much of the vanilla of the base beer, but there's a lot of silky chocolate character here. Even though it's sweet, there's enough spiciness to keep it drinkable and not taxing..  975 characters"	4.71
5056	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 release. Released about a month ago.. A: Pours an inky, dull black with a smattering of dark brown, RIS-like head. No lacing or much retention to speak of.. S: Cinnamon, dark chocolate, red chili, austere oak, vanilla, light roast, anise, dried plum, and a nominal amount of maple and bourbon..  786 characters	4.38
5057	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This beer is outstanding. Pours dark black with a thin tan head. Smells of light bourbon with strong maple. Nice sweet upfront maple with a wonderful chili finish. It is warm on the palate but not too much. Fabulous beer	4.93
5058	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"2016 Batch
L: Dark mocha hues with a rich sandy head and minimal lacing
S: Tons of peppers and cinnamon ensconced in a delicious dark amber maple
T: Sticky Grade B maple met by a muddled, but pronounced and welcomed heat by the habanero; followed up with a sweet vanilla frosting and fudge on the finish
F: Nice and rich - not crazy thick, but aided by the gooey maple
O: One of my favorite BA Cake variants. Outstanding depth of flavor and rich maple notes - just incredibly done."	4.8
5059	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Appearance - Pours thick black with decent tan head that settles to a thick ring. Spotty lacing around the glass.. Aroma - Huge barrel aroma, peppers come out nicely, the maple is a little subdued but there, big chocolate, cinnamon and bourbon aroma. A very in your face aroma everything is bog except the maple.. Taste - Wow the maple sweetness is much stronger on several levels. The maple comes in first along with a rich chocolate cupcake flavor then transitions into a nice pepper burn. The maple comes back in the end once the heat settles a bit. The barrel is there but not as strong as the nose..  762 characters	4.59
5060	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Tan head but not a lot. Dark brown/black color.. Nose is sweet and the maple shows a lot. Vanilla and cake fudge. Peppers are faint in the nose. Nice barrel flavors. Nice amount of cinnamon.. Taste: The maple is up there and the peppers show much more. Sweet and spicy. Cocoa and vanilla. The heat builds up. Typical cola/dr. Pepper flavors I get from the other cakes. Cinnamon. Awesome bourbon flavors..  558 characters	4.69
5061	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	This is one outstanding variant of the original. Pours black, and the maple shows itself upon olfactory inspection. Taste is just incredible. While the maple is the main attractions, there are hints of the other flavors, and I love how the heat doesn't kick in until the end. Better than the original in my opinion.	4.9
5062	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2016 variant drank on 4/2/2016. This is definitely a great beer. Due to the limited number of bottles, the hype and asking price for this probably overrates this thing, but it certainly is excellent. It is probably best after completing warming because the peppers settle down a bit and the maple explodes. The complexity of this is incredible. Notes of cinnamon, peppers, vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, maple, oak, molasses and so on. It's really great	4.5
5063	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	650 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of peppers, bourbon, chocolate, bourbon, and a little maple. This thing is aggressively spicy. More than the regular bourbon. Chocolate. Bourbon. Maple sweetness and lingering spice. Heavy and sweet. A little boozy. I prefer the regular bourbon over this. A little too sweet and even though it's much spicier, it doesn't elevate it.	4
5064	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Good beer. Way to overhyped. If you have a chance to try it then go for it. But not even close to being worth what people are asking. You've been warned.	4.15
5065	Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I couldn't have been more impressed with this beer. Loved the sweetness from the maple and the spices came through very well. Of the Cakes I've had, this is 2nd to the Double Barrel version from a couple years ago but not far off at all. Would be happy to try this one again.	5
5066	Emerald Grouper	16 oz can from Tavour. Cloudy amber pour, small silky head. Caramel malts first in the aroma , followed closely by bitter citrus notes. Faint honey. Sweet taste, honey, caramel coupled with a sharp bite. Velvety smooth.	3.99
5067	Emerald Grouper	16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 9/24/2019. Pours fairly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 9.5% After the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV, with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish; not overly aggressive. Amazing Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic profile. Extremely vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized honey and bready malt backbone. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp resin dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. Loved the hop profile as expected.	4.23
5068	Emerald Grouper	16oz can, date stamped 09/24/19. Hazy copper colored ale with a a foamy beige head that slowly fades into a thick foam. Rich hoppy aroma with plenty of caramel malt, tropical fruit, and citrus. Nice sweet start on the palate with caramel, grain, and honey, followed by some more bitter flavors of pine, orange & grapefruit zest along with tropical fruit notes of mango and guava - great complexity! Full body, resinous, ample carbonation, alcohol is well concealed, bittersweet finish. Exceptional beer! I might have to get another can if I come across it again.	4.46
5069	Emerald Grouper	"Pours a murky golden color. 3 finger slightly off white frothy head. The head retention is damn good. Some lacing on the glass.
The nose is hoppy, as expected. It also, to me, has a floral aroma. More of a pine hop to my nose.
Taste - Pine hop flavor, along with a slight sweetness to it.
The pine lingers in my throat. Thick, and full body.
A good, and solid IPA from Pipeworks."	4.27
5070	Emerald Grouper	L: Orange hazy hue with a short ivory head setting quickly to a thin cap and ring with moderate lacing.. S: Truly a west-coaster. This one features the PINE!. T: Rating in style it is near perfection! A very piney bitter but tolerable, sweet but un-cloying wonder! Just a touch of booze on the finish so you know what you’re drinking..  532 characters	4.56
5071	Emerald Grouper	"Bought at their Dojo warehouse bottle shop. 9/24/19 date stamp on 16oz can. Poured into 12oz snifter.. Medium pour resulted in 1inch head that faded quickly. Clear, light copper color. Smell is not overpowering with some sweet passion fruit and pineapple notes. Mouthfeel is light for an iipa, but not thin. Taste is extremely well balanced malt and hop profile with honey (and lemon?) very present on the back end followed by some mild heat from the 9.5% alcohol content.
Finishes with lingering dank, resinous pine notes, especially as the beer warms.. Overall, as delicious and well balanced as any of the style, right there with Plineys but with a kick...Dangerously sessionable for a nearly 10% beer. Going back to grab another 4-pk (or 2) tomorrow."	4.44
5072	Emerald Grouper	Orange with a cream-colored, large head with lots of little bubbles wanting to waterfall over the edge of the glass. Opacity is somewhere between clear and cloudy. Head settles down quickly, light to moderate lacing.. Nose is pine, melon, peach, citrus, grassy notes. This has big flavors, there's grapefruit, mango, pine, mandarin orange, peach, lemon, and a sticky honey sweetness.. Body is medium, the carbonation lending an aggressive and tingly feel which matches the intensity of the flavors. This is exceptionally well done.	4.55
5073	Emerald Grouper	"eyes...
massive carbonation erupts from this even on a careful pour, I mean seriously this is bubbling like a muddy hot spring, this has lead to three fingers (easy) of white head with no signs of slowing down, color wise this goes down the yellow brick road (sans the lollipop guild or flying monkeys), not the usual color but that's ok, impressive hat on this one, and clingy like those annoying nettles that you get all over your socks when hiking in the Catskills (NY). nose...
lemon spritzer, tropical leaning toward mango, definitely sense the honey (honey has a sort of 'dark' sweetness, ya know?), solid but nothing bowling me over. taste etc...
carbonation remains ample (sometimes on fizz bombs like this the fizz fades away quicker than the Baltimore Orioles since the 80s), drinks very light to medium, good mouth feeling, kind of rolls around the mouth well, very little alcohol detected but warms ya' down below, some astringent bitters that remind me of DFH 60, the mango quotient is thankfully low (I am not a fan of the trend of over the top juicy fruit hops tones, that's just me), real easy drinking, lacking a littl punch? OK, that's fair.  1,451 characters"	4.05
5074	Emerald Grouper	Bottled late spring 2016; drank 6/23/16 @ the Yarchives.. Semi-opaque bright orange appearance; champagne bubbles throughout.. A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy white head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lace..  463 characters	4.1
5075	Emerald Grouper	"22 ounce bottle, no date seen. Not sure where Pipeworks dates their bottles if at all. Poured into tulip. Pours a dark orange, rosy gold, half finger of head. Some fingers of head lace it’s way down the glass. The color of the body is not that appealing but I love a lacey beer.
Aromas of sweet ruby red grapefruit, sweet citrus, candy sweetness.
Flavors are all citrus, grapefruit, guava, peach gummies at the finish. No heat, burn or harshness. Good balance of sweet and bitter without going overboard on either end.
Finely bubbled,big but smooth bodied. Again, no heat. Overall, a very tasty beer that deserves a spot as a new classic."	4.34
5076	Emerald Grouper	Beer looks okay, but it tastes kind of like old garbage hops that someone forgot about and tried to use. I was excited to try this, but it was a huge let down.	2.71
5077	Emerald Grouper	Pours golden orange with thin head, nice lacing .. Aroma is earthy dank, get little of honey as well.. Taste follows aroma closely with sweetness coming in late.  414 characters	4.29
5078	Emerald Grouper	Appearance - The beer poured a golden yellow color with a white head.. Smell - The nose was not big, but had notes of citrus and honey.. Taste - The initial was bright and spicy orange. The honey sweetness was mild and stayed in the background with light minty notes. The orange stays strong in the aftertaste..  443 characters	4.3
5079	Emerald Grouper	Fairly fresh, aquired in a trade. No bottling date.. Super tight white bubbly head on a beautiful yellow/gold slight hazy body (I like keeping in the sediment). Aroma is pretty standard, grapefruity, citrus, piney, but really clean and clear. Flavor is awesome, everything you’d expect plus a smoother honeyed and lactose experience that delivers the hops in a soft and creamier manner. Sooo smooth for a big DIPA. Unique given the familiar hop and malt profile	4.48
5080	Emerald Grouper	22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass. thanks Ray for sharing this. Pours a orange lightly hazy body with a small white head that leaves a ring of retention.. Smells citrusy, sweet, piney. Taste is lightly bitter with citrus zest and piney hops, a tad bit of honey with a sweet malt backbone. Medium body, easy going down for 9.5%.	4.15
5081	Emerald Grouper	"A: The beer is relatively clear yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin layer of bubbles on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of mangos and papayas are present in the nose along with notes of oranges.
T: The taste follows the smell and has additional hints of pineapples near the finish. Little if any bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation with a faint amount of crispness.
O: This beer doesn't seem as strong as it tastes as the honey really boosted the strength without leaving much in the way of traces of alcohol. It is very drinkable considering its strength.. Serving type: bottle"	4.22
5082	Emerald Grouper	"Drank from a 1 pint, 6 fl. oz bottle purchased at Cambridge Wine & Spirits, Cambridge, MA
Served in a tulip. Spectacular appearance. The nearly crystal clear, medium amber body was topped by an immensely tight and fluffy, three-finger tall, bright white crown. Large swaths of thick, drippy lacing stuck along the glass and lasted until the drink’s end.. The aroma was really enticing and contained a medley of pungent, fruity hop notes. An intense, generic tropical fruit quality came through big from the get go. Really fragrant and sweet. As the beer sat, I was able to pick out ripe passionfruit notes. Some peach and apricot appeared as well. Citrus was also detectable. Orange was most noticeable. There was a dry, powdery yeasty quality too. Later, the yeasty notes intensified, as did the orange. Bit of candied orange peel as well..  1,649 characters"	4.12
5083	Emerald Grouper	Thanks to Pipeworks for sending not just their delicious regular beers (Ninja v. Unicorn!), but also plenty of great seasonals. Keep sending & I’ll keep buying. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife.. The pour is a yeasty-looking, slightly clouded orange. The nose is, as stereotypical as it is, juicy tropical fruits & sweetness, though both are subdued.. Emerald Grouper is better than the soggy catfish I had for dinner…leaving fried fish to marinate in the curry wasn’t the best of decisions. The honey is stronger than most honeyed IPAs, lovely & right up front. It mingles with strong florals, white pepper spiciness, citrus, pine, mango, with a long chord of bitterness running all the way through. Heavier & stickie than your run-o-the-mill IIPA, which limits how much I’d want to consume in one sitting..  958 characters	4.03
5084	Emerald Grouper	Pours a hazy dark apricot orange with a thick white cap that dissipates quickly but leave great lacing. The aroma is lots of fresh fruit both tropical and citrus, pineapple and mango are most present. The flavor is sweet ripe fruits, honey and a touch of pine bitterness. Feel is very good, smooth and thick, but could use more carbonation. Overall a fantastic beer. Would buy often if in 12 ounce format and priced as such.	4.6
5085	Emerald Grouper	Poured into tulip with a very thick head. Probably 2 inches, at least. Complex smell and taste. A lot going on. The finish and feel is very smooth and features honey. Great IIPA!	4.5
5086	Emerald Grouper	A-a somewhat hazy gold with a fingers worth of. S-lots of tropical fruit, citrus, and honey. T-similar to the smell with lots of tropical fruit, honey sweetness, and a citrus bitter finish.  281 characters	4.4
5087	Emerald Grouper	Pours a glowing golden color with a fresh white head. Smell had dank earthy hops and white fruit smells. Taste was earthy and dank with tropical citrus and passion fruit . A soft mouthfeel made even softer with the honey ABV is well hidden with a little dry pine in the finish. Delicious 2IPA here.	4.44
5088	Emerald Grouper	Draught pour at Ironside in a snifter.. L: Golden with 1 finger of high density white head with moderate retention and left mixed lacing.. S: Very dank, definitely Mosaic shining through, with floral and tropical undertones..  566 characters	4.5
5089	Emerald Grouper	I had to search my memory for another beer that utilizes honey so well... and then it hit me. Duh! HopSlam!. I've been chasing down a bottle of Emerald Grouper for a couple of years now - and lo and behold, no sooner does Pipeworks begin distro to MN, and it's sitting in my local cooler just a couple months later. Shazam! The only thing that might thrill me more is if Sure Bet dropped here. Fingers crossed!. Emerald Grouper is a very unique beer - the nose presents plenty of pine and bitterness, but the taste is a very nice, mellow, warm honey flavor. With some hop bitterness of course. And that contrast? I'm loving it. Emerald Grouper, if anything, I think is probably even easier drinking than Hopslam. Though I believe it may be higher ABV? I'm too lazy to look - take that with a grain of salt. But, per my recollection - it's definitely a softer, lighter, easier-drinking beer..  955 characters	4.71
5090	Emerald Grouper	Pours orange with a thick head. The smell is fantastic, mango, lemon, pineapple, grassy. Taste is tropical up front and then some sweetness from the honey and just a little bitterness at the end. It has medium carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. Overall this was a really nice beer, one of my favorites from Pipeworks.	4.46
5091	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	750ml bottle at share. pale golden with small ring of head. Stone fruit, peaches in the aroma, light savory notes. Lots more dessert elements in the taste, cinnamon, peaches, pie crust.	4.03
5092	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	9/10/2018 release. Drank on 9/28/2019. A wealth of slightly overripe, pulpy peach - wish it were funkier or more sour, but it's fantastic, regardless.	4.49
5093	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Had side by side Casey's Leaner. Side Project's had a bit more funk and layers to it, but I preferred Casey's powerful fruit notes. Both were fantastic!	4.7
5094	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Foggy burnt gold with a fuzzy white blanket that recedes to a thin ring.. Having just had Jammy b2 before popping this cork, the aroma here features significantly more funk and complexity by comparison, with barnyard hay and straw, lightly stinky nutty cheese, and toast, all sufficiently met by juicy peach and apricot.. Taste is more peachy than smell, featuring a stupid amount a drippy peach with a soft froth and a tingly semi-dry finish..  461 characters	4.46
5095	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	01/2016 - incredible peach aromas, plus white wine, oakiness coming through; acidic as all hell on the palate and finish; slightly sweet, peachy keen, and barnyard on the palate, too; flavorful, spritzy finish.	4.42
5096	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	On tap at Casey. White head. Golden yellow color.. So much tart, juicy peaches. Wow, so dominant. Some acidity. Tart and sour. Easy drinking for the abv.. Very drinkable. Glad I got to try it on tap.	4.75
5097	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Bright veiled orange body, small white head diminishing to a ring, foam sticking to the glass, leaving lots of lacings.. Nose: Peaches, peaches and peaches again, that juicy peach you would get the juice all over your hands and mouth while eating it. Beautifully funky.. Sourness, juicy peaches up front, a lot of yeasty component, very long aftertaste, you just can't get enough!.  497 characters	4.65
5098	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	"They have brewed this beer every year for the last 3 years straight and it's considered ""retired"" - when was the last time Oude Fermier or Ann was freshly brewed? those are still on the top 250 list- just food for thought.. Leaner b2 pours a beautiful orange glow, the dregs at the end of the of the bottle were added to everyones glass and added a hazy dreamsicle look.
Aroma is a spritzer peach, lacking the oak theory funk, this is cleaner and pronounces the fruit well.
Taste is fuzzy peaches, a bit puckering at first but mellows quickly, all fruit all sour all good.
Feel is bit on the sour-side like mentioned above, I don't remember a casey bottle with that type of feel, must be the Side Project cultures taking over a bit.
Overall an extremely good sour, sour peaches to the max, happy to finally get to try this one, would seek it out again!"	4.43
5099	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Enjoyed out of a brown 750 mL bottle with a sticker denoting it as being bottled on 9/13/2016. Consumed as part of a small bottle share on 4/22. Poured into a teku style glass.. Appearance (4.25) - Pours a vibrant yellow with just the slightest twinge of orange giving it a depth of color. Not really terribly hazy, but it's also not completely translucent either--likely from the fact that we had no lambic basket handy to keep the yeast confined to the bottom of the bottle. The dregs looked like straight juice. Not much of a head--just a little bit and pretty much no lacing to speak of.. Smell (4.5) - Wonderful aroma of fresh-cut, ripe peach flesh is accentuated by underlying acidity and brightness from the wild bacteria. Honestly, there's not much to write about the aroma because it's so simple and straightforward. The peach flavor is front and center, even though it's been seven months since bottling..  1,706 characters	4.46
5100	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Bomber batch 1: murky peach color, smells of acidic peach, lemon, and stone fruit.... Taste follows with a fairly strong sour component, peach, lemon, stone fruit and bourbon! Definitely sour, but rounded out by the fruit....nicely concentrated!	4.42
5101	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Broke this treat out for beer 4,000.. Bottled Sep 13th 2016, opened Mar 11th 2017.. A - Golden hay body with one finger of bright white, loosely bubbled head. Low retention and lace..  471 characters	4.55
5102	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	B2. This was a very nice beer, although it did not meet hype. Beer was flat when poured. The nose was all fruit, the taste was jammy goodness. Overall its very nice, kinda sucked that it was flat, and side by side i much preferred fou	4.38
5103	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Hazy yellow color without much head. Nose is like wild peach with fresh picked peaches. Taste is a lot of tartwith a lot of peaches. Feel is very full and enjoyable. This is a fantastic beer.	4.74
5104	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	batch 2 - 10/15/16 - Enjoyed at Casey.. Just thinking about this beer makes my mouth water. Had it side by side with The Cut: Peach and the look of the Leaner is hazier and looks more like a peach color than the much more bright yellow (and also delicious) Peach Cut. Upon smelling it you get the sense it's going to be intensely sour, and it is, but amazingly the peach flavor still shines through and it seems to be a perfect balance. As the Cut series is 5% ABV, I was shocked to realize after I had a few sips that the Leaner was 8%. The name is apropos, it tastes like the most sour, juicy peach you've ever had squeezed in a glass. Leaner is one of the best sours I've had. Psyched to have a couple bottles to save for a special occasion.	5
5105	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	killer beer, amazing to have in such close proximity with the westly, which although was apricot and not peaches, makes a great side by side. the beers are similar in some ways, but this was much more interesting on the yeast front, much less sour, equally fruity. peaches rule this one, drippy and ripe just like the namesake, aroma and flavor are the peak of ripeness, hardly sweet at all, just juicy and true, fuzzy and woody and awesome. soft yellowish orange beer, hazy and heady, well carbonated, dry, and who knew it was so strong on the booze? you dont taste it in the least nor feel it at all. brett out in front of souring cultures in this one for me, funky and layered and real mature. this must have spent quite a bit of time ageing, fermenting all this fruit out. the peaches are insane, yellow and bursting out of this. in some ways, the sourness takes over the apricot in westly a bit, here, the fruit leads the way and is merely accentuated by the yeasts. still plenty of acid, but a lot of nuance to it, maybe less wood, but more interesting i think. i like this as much as i liked either westly or fuzzy from side project in isolation, and think if they made more of it, it would have to be one of the most hyped beers ever. its immediately in that range with stuff like fou foune, cascade, allagash, and the other greatest peach or apricot lambics out there. lots of wheaty body, even oaty, fluffy and expansive, inviting, micro bubbles are very active in it too. i couldnt imagine this improving in any way, its a truly beautiful beer. thanks to claystation for sharing it with us, a real treat, and a new high water mark for casey, and thats really saying something if you have been keeping up with their releases lately.... edit: leaving my original scores in place, but we drank a batch 1 from ages ago this weekend and it really had changed. acidity ramped way up, peach faded way back, and just a totally different brew, still compelling and complex and delicious by any standard, but a far cry from what it was when it was new and the fruit character was so explosive in here and the funk was on par with the sour. maybe not meant for extended cellaring...	4.64
5106	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	750ml bottle, first blend from the Casey side of the collaboration. Served in a stemmed glass.. Pours a beautiful, hazy medium yellow body, one finger white head, great retention. Pretty much identical to Side Project's version. Smell is dripping with peach juice. It's more aggressive on the nose. But also more aggressive is the lactic acidity, which is a bit surprising as typically it is the Side Project that tends to have a reputation for being more acidic. A bit of cheese, fair bit of oak, mild dusty funk, but the nose is driven by peaches, and there are peaches for days! Flavour is a bit more skewed in favor of the acidity. Heavy lactic acidity with a touch of lemon seems to be the main theme here. Same big peach flavour, but it is slightly overshadowed. Dusty funk, oak rounds things out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, but as said before, it is pretty heavy on the lactic acidity. I don't mind it certainly, but I am wishing it was dialed back a bit so I could get even more of the peach on the background of oak and dust. That being said, I enjoyed this one a bit more than the Side Project version. Everything about SP's version that was so well done has been amplified up to a 11. So I guess it depends on what you are looking for and what your preferences are.	4.5
5107	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	750 mL into a wine glass.. A- Peach-skin colored. Hazy with low-carbonation. 4.5. S- Distinctive Casey aroma. Funky and yeasty with a delicate floral quality followed by unripe, tart peach. Not nearly as fruity or explosive as the Side Project version's aroma. 4.25.  528 characters	4.59
5108	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Wow, peaches for days! Poured from a bottle, hazy peach color and funky peach aroma. Was amazing at colder temps, and became more acidic as it warmed. Perfectly carbed, great collab between Casey and SP. Wish I could compare with the SP version.	4.94
5109	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Lucky enough to try on tap at Falling Rocks in Denver. If you've heard the hype, believe it. It's what I imagine fermented peaches would taste like. Little alcohol, lots of peach flavor, a good sour funk that dances with the sweetness of peach. Never heard of this before my vacation in CO, I'd come back just for this!	4.81
5110	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	750 mL bottle. Super hazy pale orange. Smells of oak and lemony acidic yeast. Peaches are kinda sweet smelling. Taste is pretty sour. Strong sourness. Must be the Side Project part of the collab... Sour peaches. Heavy oak. Pretty nice. Heavy peach and almost too strong of a sourness. Tasty, though.	4.04
5111	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	This beer is very interesting. I would say that from Side Project I prefer Smooth and from Casey I prefer Family Preserves Peach, but this is still very good. Maybe a touch too acidic, but I'm not going to complain.	4.75
5112	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	This might be the first sour worthy of a 5. The signature mouthfeel of Casey with that acidity of Side Project. This peach explosion is sheer perfection.	5
5113	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Collaboration between Casey and Side Project. Casey's version features a new 8% ABV saison base (compared to his normal 6%), the addition of cultures from both Casey and Side Project, and Colorado peaches.. I received a surprise pour at Vail Big Beers on Saturday (thanks Troy!). Given the hype behind this beer, I thought for sure that it was overdone and that it couldn't be THAT much better than Peach Cut, Peach Fruit Stand, etc. As it turns out, it is a notch above. Perfect carbonation, a huge juicy peach aroma, and an awesome bold body. I'm loving the ramped-up saison base in this beer. Noticeably more acidity assumingly due to the Side Project culture addition, and the flavor is just bursting with fresh juicy peaches. It's hard to say exactly which Casey beer is my #1 favorite, but this is most certainly in my top 3. A fantastic collaboration!	4.88
5114	Casey / Side Project - Leaner	Enjoyed the night of the release. Outstanding balance of peach flesh/juice, funk, and tart/crisp drinkability. Every sip left you both satisfied, yet wanting more. Very bright fruit, little to no peach or stone-fruit skin (ala AdF) juicy as hell as the name would suggest. A real joy to drink. My favorite from Troy yet. Excited to see what the wine barrels and house cultures do to the SP version. The hype is real with this one folks...even if I'm a homer local.	5
5115	Coffee Abraxas	"2018 vintage. Coffee is almost nonexistent. Either the base abraxas flavors over power the coffee, or the coffee died out quick. Still good, but to me does not live up to the name ""Coffee Abraxas"""	4.16
5116	Coffee Abraxas	Outstanding imperial stout. Thick, motor oil pour and feel, coffee is heavy on the nose, and similarly is the most present of the adjuncts. It feels more like it's own beer than an Abraxas variant, as most of the cinnamon and pepper is subdued by the coffee. Not a bad thing, just different than what I expected.	4.53
5117	Coffee Abraxas	Very thankful for a good friend that went to the Abraxas release this year and then shared each of the variants at bottle shares. I love the regular Abraxas. But the coffee variant adds an awesome layer to an already great beer.	4.6
5118	Coffee Abraxas	"Pours black and after a very moderate intensity pour, nets near zero head. What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it's there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I've had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two. Due to the namesake of this beer ""Coffee Abraxas"", this is a slight disappointment, although it is still a dynamic, complex stout worthy of cozying up to on the coldest of nights.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 750mL bottle."	4.34
5119	Coffee Abraxas	I am normally not a big fan of cinnamon in my stouts but the coffee really hides it in this. Balancing it out very well, I actually like this more than OG Abraxas.	5
5120	Coffee Abraxas	Got this in a trade awhile back and left it in the fridge for about 6 months before tasting with family and friends recently. I honestly think this helped preserve the coffee flavor, which was still strong and very well-balanced. I've never had BAA or regular Abraxas, but I will say that this was the first beer we drank on Dark Lord Day 18, and it was definitely the best beer we drank all day.	4.99
5121	Coffee Abraxas	I'm sorry but regular abraxis is better. I was disappointed this varaints didn't have a stronger coffee flavor. I had it from the tap at the brewery pub.	3.99
5122	Coffee Abraxas	Black with a large mocha foam that dies to a creamy thin blanket, then nothing, leaving brown legs that stain the glass with a swirl.. Smell is raisin and loads of cinnamon, much like a spiced bagel, with a red fruity sort of pepper, or is that the coffee? There's a slight char of brown sugar and a touch of licorice as well.. A tangy flavor of roasted dark malt is joined by a solid punch of dusty cinnamon-brown sugar and a good toastiness. I can actually feel a bite of pepper towards the swallow, which I don't normally expect much of in Abraxas. Coffee isn't contributing much but a red fruitiness and maybe a touch of bitterness, even as it warms, which is pretty disappointing, considering the clout that something like BA Sump brings..  871 characters	4.07
5123	Coffee Abraxas	The beer pours a Pitch Black with a large frothy brown head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of cinnamon sticks, coffee roast, baker’s chocolate, hot pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg. It tastes of cinnamon sticks, roasted coffee beans, cayenne, nutmeg, with mild chille heat. The mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Overall, a very good stout from Perrnnial. Just wish there was more spicy, hunapu is my favorite in this style of stout.	4.47
5124	Coffee Abraxas	Looks like a black hole..smell is cinnamon, coffee and chili peppers..my throat tingles a bit from the chilli pepper..taste is cinnamon up front mixed nicely with the chili pepperz and coffee is bringing up the rear..very nicely done.. sweet and thick with very little carbonation..this turns the regular abraxas up a hefty notch, and is quite delicious..one of the best coffee stouts ive had and one of the best stouts period..fantastic!!	4.61
5125	Coffee Abraxas	RBSG 17 grand tasting. Oily black pour, thin ring of beige head, curtains of lacing. Aroma has coffee (as expected) up front, lot sof coffee cake flavors behind. Taste has the roast malts, coffee, cinnamon and chocolate, raisins. A big breakfast sweet roll. Nice	4
5126	Coffee Abraxas	Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Perennial stemmed wine glass. Thanks Ray for sharing this one.. If you’re into spiced stouts, which I am, the aromas on this are out of this world. Heavy cinnamon and coffee, much more spice aromas than regular abraxas with the addition of coffee. Cinnamon toast crunch is the first thing that came to my head.. The taste is just as potent, complex, and spice-forward with a HUGE amount of flavor, dominated by cinnamon and milk chocolate, following through with freshly roasted coffee, semisweet chocolate, vanilla, and more spices. Mouthfeel is awesome, super thick with low carbonation..  744 characters	4.74
5127	Coffee Abraxas	2017 bottle poured into a tulip. Poured deep black with a mocha head. Smells of cinnamon, spice and subtle coffee. I could smell this beer forever. Taste was amazing...rich cinnamon and spice all balanced out by the coffee. Really enjoyable. Feel was slick, mouth coating and spot on for the style. Overall, this beer is outstanding in the spiced stout category. Not sure I’ve had one (non BA) that I enjoyed as much as this.	4.81
5128	Coffee Abraxas	It poured out as a rich deep black color with a mocha colored head on top. The smell of the beer is good but the coffee is a bit masked by the cinnamon. The taste of the beer has a good balance of flavors. The coffee is still a little hidden but creeeps through in the finish. The feel of the beer is very nice, smooth and rich. Overall it’s a very good brew. A real treat to try!	4.26
5129	Coffee Abraxas	2017 bottling.. A: Pours black with a dense, Guinness-like rising dark brown head. Decent retention.. S: Cinnamon dominates the aroma, alongside light dark roast coffee, roast, sweet chili pepper, vanilla, and a whiff of dark dried fruit..  882 characters	4.26
5130	Coffee Abraxas	poured from a 750mL bottle into an oversized snifter. pours pitch black with fluffy dark brown head. smells of coffee, cinnamon, chocolate and slight vanilla. coffee and cinnamon are dominant aromas. taste follows with dominant cinnamon coffee finished with chocolate, vanilla and a slight pepper burn for good measure. mouthfeel is thick, oily, low carb with the cinnamon pop providing the bubbly effect on the tongue. overall, this has long been my favorite variant and favorite iteration of abraxas. keeps all the aspects that make abraxas so great but with an added level of flavor and aromas complexity through the coffee addition.	4.6
5131	Coffee Abraxas	Abraxas is my favorite Stout, and the Coffee varient does not disappoint. Tastes of Cinnamon, Chocolate, and Coffee. If you like Coffee stouts this is sure to impress.	4.94
5132	Coffee Abraxas	Mouth feel was ok. Straight cinnamon on the nose. Not much coffee on the taste. Nice thick and dark. This was a 2015 so it definitely has dropped off.	4.26
5133	Coffee Abraxas	Pours jet black thick like used motor oil mocha colored head. Aroma - the based beer shines through but with great coffee aroma, cinnamon, chocolate and vanilla.. Taste - The taste in the coffee version is not as sweet the coffee cuts the cinnamon but there is still alot there. All of the flavors are very well balanced..  461 characters	4.84
5134	Coffee Abraxas	Served in an 8 oz glass, None of the legendary Abraxas flavor for me in this 2016 vintage. Prob should have drank it sooner. Taste like burnt coffee w a weak sugary flavor.	4.03
5135	Coffee Abraxas	750ml bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours deep black in color with a thin creamy khaki colored head that has good retention. S- smells of chili pepper skin, cinnamon, vanilla, earthy espresso & dark chocolate.  626 characters	4.35
5136	Coffee Abraxas	This beer is just perfect. The spices merge perfectly with the Sump coffee and form a brew that is smooth, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. I could drink this on a cool morning and be perfectly happy	4.71
5137	Coffee Abraxas	2016 vintage, poured from the bottle into a taster. Typical Abraxas flavor with a bit of coffee - not considerably better than regular Abraxas, but the coffee works well and does not overpower the traditional Abraxas flavor profile.	4.5
5138	Coffee Abraxas	"I didn't get a ton of coffee in this, just a hint. Is that the idea with this? Seems perhaps that way with the other reviews but folks also rave about big coffee notes and flavors. Either way, was still Abraxas and my scoring would've been higher had it lived up to actually being ""Coffee"" Abraxas. Simply because the coffee was so minimal."	4.56
5139	Coffee Abraxas	Odd to say, but I though it was better than regular Abraxas, and regular Abraxas might be the best regular stout I have ever had. Perfect balance of coffee and spice, soft but full mouthfeel, taste to kill for.	5
5140	Fyodor	Rich, dense, smooth and delicious. Tons of cocoa, caramel, vanilla, coffee with subtle waves of anise, bourbon and black currants. Very complex and tasty. I will definitely get this one again if I come across it.	4.46
5141	Fyodor	Pours black with a finger of thin, large khaki bubbles. Aroma is toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat to the back, which is soothed out by oak. Flavor profile is really well developed, hitting notes of roasty, toasty and caramely malts with sugary notes of caramel, toffee, molasses and brown sugar. Bourbon is present, but not out of place, adding a subtle twinge of heat that works to establish a better balance. Oak and char add a little smooth bitterness at the finish. Mouth feel is still with very little nuance to the texture. It has a full and thick consistency. Overall, stout is solid with subtle and well maintained levels of flavor, heat and bourbon.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 500mL bottle.	4.31
5142	Fyodor	Poured from a 2017 bottle into a snifter. Carbonation is moderate. I was hoping this would be a bit thicker. Nice barrel presence in both aroma and flavor.	4.33
5143	Fyodor	"L - Deep, opaque black with a dark tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind minimal lacing.
S - Tons of molasses on the nose along with roasted malts and oak with some warming bourbon on the nose.
T - Incredibly complex: Rich dark, bitter chocolate throughout as well as rich molasses along with caramel, vanilla, roasted malts and barely as well as burnt oak and sweet bourbon
F - Medium to full bodied with light carbonation - thick, soft, silky. Could be a little fuller in my opinion.
O - An incredibly complex, and incredibly good BBA stout. Well done."	4.51
5144	Fyodor	L: Dark Black except where light fringes the glass for a chocolate brown, a third finger dark mocha head with little retention or lacing.. S: This is a boozy bourbon punch in the nose even after 9 months bottle aging. The smell is not a delectable bourbon, rather it smells like Everclear 190 proof with some vanilla for good measure. I definitely don't get anise haha or any finer thing like that.. T: Anyone who says anise in my view is copying the notes. This is booze and far from beer finery. I don't get bourbon heat, instead the taste of vodka, with the smallest amounts of oak, vanilla, and chocolate in descending measure..  1,263 characters	3.6
5145	Fyodor	Appearance is very dark brown with a loosely formed tan head. Head has moderate retention, but minimal lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malt, raisins, and a hint of anise. Taste adds molasses, coffee, and vanilla to the mix. It’s still quite hot, but should mellow with age. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous.	4.55
5146	Fyodor	Pitch black to dark brown with a slight hint of Ruby when held to the light. Topped with a half finger of rusty dark brown beige head.. It smells of umami so he sauce toasted notes, chocolate and hints of wine and oak barrels. I also get a black liquorice on the nose and some allspice. The taste is of chocolate, coffee, Coco dust a hint of scotch and bourbon oak. I got black liquorice again and some of the spice comes through and soy sauce. Slightly sweet very little char.. The thick and oily body is lightened with hints of barrel and oak. Its really smooth and certainly covers the Abv..  709 characters	4.19
5147	Fyodor	Near black, brown edges, decent initial heads that fades to none with no lacing.. Delicious blend of bourbon, coffee, molasses, anise in the nose. Coffee, malt, bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate. Yes..  278 characters	4.9
5148	Fyodor	A: dark black without much head.. S: oak, vanilla, and molasses come out right away. Bourbon follows up the aroma.. T: brown sugar, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and a long lingering caramel flavor..  334 characters	4.26
5149	Fyodor	Corked and caged bottle poured into a snifter. Dark brown liquid, two finger brown foam cap , dense rich bubbles that form larger bubbles as the pour recedes, good lacings , good rentention, settles to a dense foam layer. Aroma of anise, bourbon, tobacco, milk chocolate, char, roasted malts.  442 characters	4.38
5150	Fyodor	Poured from a cork'n'cage bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2018 edition.. L: Dark, dark pour... nearly black with a bit of mahogany around the edges. 1 finger of tannish head leaves a nice thin ring of lacing.. S: Rich and roasty... bourbon and booze mixed with vanilla and cocoa..  710 characters	4.35
5151	Fyodor	"500ml bottle. 2017 Series, Batch No 02. 13.5%ABV.
Black colored body. Just a thin fizzy head upon pouring but this does not stay around long. Has a thin ring. Lacing spots have a tendency of sliding back down into body.
Aroma of roasted malts, dark currant/cherry fruit, coffee, and spice.
Taste is dark roasted malts, faint coffee, dark chocolate, and a swirl of barrel notes (oak wood, smoke, and vanilla). Suggested is dark cherry fruit, black licorice, and other spices such as anise.
Fuller mouth feel. Lower carbonation.
A beer that is super dark in the glass, and expresses a complex profile of malts, fruit, chocolate, coffee, and spices , but is super smooth and has very little bitterness (it does has some sourness). Lack of carbonation allows the beer to sit in the mouth and express its full taste profile. Heavy on the palate. The alcohol is in the aroma (nostrils) but does not come through in the taste."	4.42
5152	Fyodor	Black, thick foamy head that settles into a fluffy cap. Aroma is fairly dark - lots of dark roast coffee, mild espresso, dark chocolate upfront. There is some bourbon caramel there but wanted a little more of that. A little fusel booze lingering.. I felt the palate to be pretty similar - heavy on those robust, dark notes with just not enough to smooth it out. Deep coffee, charred oak, a little ash / tobacco leaf, dark cacao etc. The bourbon notes are overwhelmed - you can find a little caramel / vanilla but it is drowned in those stout flavors. Some boozey heat on the backend which isn’t transitioned to nicely with a lingering sting of whiskey. Needs better harmony & balance.	4.02
5153	Fyodor	Pours black with an everlasting ring of tan head that leaves sparse dots of lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak, coffee and char. Tastes of bourbon, cold brew coffee, oak, dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted malts char, vanilla, caramel and a hint of tobacco. Full bodied, light carbonation, creamy and chewy mouth feel and a dry finish.	4.36
5154	Fyodor	"$ 17.46 (Including shipping)/500 mL cork and cage bottle ($ 1.033/oz) from Tavour, Seattle, WA. Reviewed 2/23/19.
“BREWED JANUARY 25, 2018” at top of rear label. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 54 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 5.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque.
Head – Large (Maximum 6.3 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, medium density and rocky, average retention, diminishing to an irregular three to five mm ring and a rocky partial layer. Head retraction leaves behind thick, wide bands of lacing as well as isolated islands.
Lacing – Excellent. This produces marked three-dimensional bands of lacing, consisting almost exclusively of tiny bubbles. Rings are connected by thin columns.
First pour – Dark brown, clear.
Aroma – 4.25 - Initially sweet chocolate and roasted malt with some “dark fruit”, shifting to wood. Wood remains the predominant odor for the remainder of the serving, although some bourbon appears as it further warms.
Flavor – 4.25 - Begins with light chocolate flavor followed by a bit of caramel and some “dark fruit”. Allowing it to warm in my mouth allows the alcohol (13.5% ABV) flavor to stampede forth. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.
Palate – 4 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 4.25 – Overall, a very attractive and aromatic brew, with the appearance approaching perfection for a Russian Imperial Stout. The nose is complex and exciting while the taste also demonstrates more complexity than I can articulate – I will leave this to someone with better taste buds. Overall, just one damn good brew!"	4.27
5155	Fyodor	after a stellar line up of beers....this was the last of em. kbbs, mornin delight, bg&e, ground state now this.... no viscosity to it when u pour (oil look lack)l, thin look finger head dissipated quick, toasty mild sweet char taste and coffee, medium feel.....she’s good though... I’d bang again	4.32
5156	Fyodor	Drinking this tonight at a share with my husband and his two friends. I told them that they had to get this for me a while back and they finally came through, bout time!	5
5157	Fyodor	Drinking tonight at a share with a few buddies and we have been trying to get this for a long time. Boy oh boy was it worth the wait. Chocolate, coffee, caramel. Great!	5
5158	Fyodor	Have a small stash, so time to christen one. Poured cellar temp hard to a tulip glass. Color is deep mahogany. Head is three fingers, tan plumper they leaves some scant lacing. Nose is predominantly vanilla with a little char on the backend. First sips are char, vanilla, roasty, malty goodness. Very full,smooth mouthfeel. If you had it, you get the base RIS all day, but the bourbon and barrel give you a nice bite, without being overbearing. Mellow, creaminess reminds me of a Prairie Artisan Paradise, where the coconut levels it out. No alcohol bite, but it hits you after a little time. Get it! Just letting out doofus dog on the deck and this is a great beer for a brisk winter night.	4.57
5159	Fyodor	"Welcome to my Happy New Russian Stone Beer Sunday (Week 729)! I have all three (3) of Stone's 2018 Small Batch Series in readiness. This week, I have been reading ""The Greatest Russian Stories of Crime and Suspense"" as edited by Otto Penzler & yesterday, during my neighborhood church's Attic Treasures monthly rummage sale, I scored two (2) souvenir glasses from St. Petersburg. Additionally, St. Amandus had his birthday on Saturday so it seems as though the Beer Gods want today to happen. Don't like my idea? As they say in Moscow, ""Toughski shitski, comrade!"". From the Bottle: ""Small Batch Escondido""; ""2018 Series Batch No. 1""; ""Stone Totalitarian Imperial Russian Stout Aged in Bourbon Barrels""; ""Ages Well Store at Cellar Temp (55 F/13 C) or Below""; ""Brewed January 25, 2018""; ""Stone Totalitarian Imperial Russian Stout is a thick, rich and sinful beer that’s heavy on the palate and massively aromatic with notes of anise, black currants, coffee and roastiness.""; ""In the Mash [-] Roasted Barley, Unmalted Oats and Pale, Amber & Black Malts""; ""In the Boil [-] Warrior Hops""; ""Whirlpool [-] Belma Hops""; ""Unfiltered and Aged 8 months in American Oak Kentucky Bourbon Barrels""; ""IBUs 43""; ""Bottled October 2018""; ""Cellar Notes [-] This profoundly complexed beer will overwhelm all but the most stalwart beer fanatics with its level of intensity. Rich coffee, bitter and milk chocolate characteristics abound, while dark charred oak, rich vanilla and caramel from the bourbon barrels synergistically elevate and further enhance the ultra-intense taste of the original beer. The name we chose for this heady creation, 'Fyodor', is a tip of the hat to Fyodor Dostoyevsky, one of the greatest, most influential novelists of Russia’s Golden Age."". Lots to transcribe, but I'm going to be with this beer for some time. I began by unhooking the cage & exposing the cork, all while keeping my L thumb on the cork. It was a wasted effort as the cork was an immovable object! Grrr. 8={} Where's my corkscrew?!? F**k! Since I am not an oenophile like my beloved maternal uncle, I only have a cheapie in my inventory. The cork fought me mightily, but in the end, I was triumphant! Eureka! Success in the face of adversity! Onward! I slowly filled one of my St. Petersburg glasses, being careful not to disturb any lees on the punt. It came up pretty quickly with foam, forming two-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head that quickly reduced to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Khrushchev nodded in agreement, having kept the Nazis from penetrating at the Battle of Stalingrad. The nose penetrated my sinuses & gave me pause. What had I gotten myself into? Was I going to be like Lee Harvey Oswald - a person interested in Russian lore & literature, only to be rebuffed by the Russians? Eek. It had the distinctive coconut odor that I associate with Bourbon Bbl.-aging. Its booziness was not overwhelming, but it was like sniffing the air of a shark tank from above. All seemed calm & peaceful from that vantage point, but danger lurked below & in my glass. Mouthfeel was thick & full, very viscous. It lay upon my tongue like a beached whale, refusing to move or to be moved. No problem as I took in its liquified fudge brownie taste. Highly chocolaty in a deep, dark, Baker's chocolate way with a smoky charcoal aspect & the Bourbon really beginning to kick in. I remember the first time that I sipped Bourbon. I was quite young & an adult slipped me some at a NYE party at my parents' house. This beer evoked that memory. It is not that I do not like Bourbon, but I prefer Rye. In fact, where I had eschewed liquor for many, many years thanks to repeated liberty incidents, it was the resurgence of Rye whisky that brought me back to the fold. I am older & (hopefully) wiser now so my imbibing in distilled liquor is done in small amounts. While typing that last bit, I found myself absentmindedly licking & smacking my lips. It was just THAT tasty! Yum! Stone recommends storing at Cellar Temps, but I would encourage drinking it at Room Temp. It was really blossoming & opening up as it warmed. The flavors were bonding more than they had been at the outset so that it no longer seemed quite as boozy & it did seem more chocolaty as a result. The coconut & charcoal smokiness remained a constant throughout. Phew. Anise! How did I miss it? This is why I always transcribe information! Of course. I would almost say ""treacle"", but that would be imprecise. Anise. That also helps to account for that charcoal sharpness that I had noted. Now, a question - Too late for me, but how would/will this age? I have a feeling that it would really smooth out to become eminently drinkable. It is quite the drink now, in its youth, but as it ages, I think that it has real potential. Finish was dry, quite bitter in the way that black coffee & Baker's chocolate are bitter. I was duly impressed throughout."	4.66
5160	Fyodor	Black-bodied beer under a finger of tan foam... Similar to Mikhail, but without that coffee infusion... Aromas and flavors of charred wood, roasted black malts, and cold espresso coffee; not too sweet - the bittersweet chocolate leans more toward the bitter side, with a drying finish... Medium-bodied and smooth - a very nice stout.... Brewed 1/25/18, bottled in October of 2018; Totalitarian forms the base stout, featuring roasted barley, unmalted oats, and pale, amber, and black malts, Warrior and Belma hops; aged 8 months in Kentucky bourbon barrels; 13.1% abv...	4.5
5161	Fyodor	"A-Pours a jet black color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has generous Bourbon hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a nice delicate Bourbon flavor
M-A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
O-A very well balanced stout"	4.5
5162	Fyodor	The beer pours a delicious looking and creamy brown head that dissipates at a moderate pace. The beer itself has a nice dark chocolate black color with a thick looking yet smooth texture to it. The smell is delicious. It has a good bourbon and vanilla notes upfront and are the stronger smells while the dark chocolate is slightly overwhelmed but still manages to appear in the finish. The taste is surprisingly very different from the smell. The bourbon notes and vanilla come out more in the finish while a bitter dark chocolate and coffee notes along with a decent wood note are upfront. The feel is really good with a heavy body but very silky and bubbly carbonation feel to it. Overall, this is a fantastic beer worth getting a hold of if you can.	4.5
5163	Fyodor	Bottle dated October 2018 into pint glass. Pours a very dark brown with a thin tan head. Initial impression is milk chocolate, coffee, booze, maybe a hint of dark fruits. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Carbonation is light. Finish is smooth and chocolatey, fading to a noticeable coffee/expresso bite in the back of the throat. Definitely a sipper, but oh my it is good! First Stone offering I've had in a long time, but it was worth the wait.	4.06
5164	Fyodor	Dark brown / black pour with thin creme colored lacing. Oak and bourbon aroma with some booziness. Taste is predominantly oak and bourbon with some chocolate and light char. Full bodied, thick,. 'Really enjoyed this one. While Stone is really known for their IPA's their barrel aged beers can be very good too.	4.25
5165	Kiwi Herman	I sat on this bottle for a bit - I was afraid that the fruit had fallen off and it would just be a funky sour. Thankfully, age has done this zero harm... the beer is quite fragrant, instantly - tons of strawberry to the nose with some sour notes as well. I didn't catch the kiwi, but I don't know kiwi all that well, honestly.. As this beer warmed up, it became teeth-meltingly sour. I'm still amazed by how sour it is. My mouth was actually hurting when I finished it - amazing stuff. It's also just a bit funky, for depth of taste. Tons of strawberry, funk, and sour - it's a full spectrum experience, with nice body and carbonation.. This bottle was well-worth the wait, and the price tag. Super pleased with this beer!	4.46
5166	Kiwi Herman	On tap at the brewery from their last release, December 15 2017. Poured into tulip glass. Reviewed from notes.. Kiwi Herman Light golden tan appearance, no head, red wine vinegar, raspberry, tropical nose. Crisp, lactic acid, unripe raspberries kiwi. Starts crisp and tart, more fruity mid-sip. Closes with a quick, clean, finish with touches of red wine vinegar lingering..  465 characters	4.84
5167	Kiwi Herman	2017 batch drank on 3/15/2018. Overall this was a fine beer to finally be able to try. The mix of barrels and fruits brought a nice complexity of flavors to this. The kiwi presence was really unique and pleasant. There was a good amount of tartness and while it drank really well, there was an unpleasant finish. A sugary, bitter aftertaste hit me and it really was not enjoyable. The only negative I have on this but the rest was great.	4.28
5168	Kiwi Herman	"Thanks Ryan for Sharing. 16 oz bottle into a tulip.. Lightly red orange body
Smell - lightly tart and fruity with a malty biscuit aroma. On the tongue is lots of sour strawberry notes, lactic acidity, straw, on the aftertaste is biscuits, bready yeast , Corn. Like strawberry shortcake or corn bread with strawberries. Interesting beer, very tasty. Not a ton of kiwi flavor."	4.4
5169	Kiwi Herman	Most recent batch poured into a stemmed tulip. Golden amber in color. Very minimal head that dissipates quick. Aroma of lactic acid in subtle fruit. Taste is strawberry, kiwi and some biscuit. Tastes like a sour strawberry shortcake. Feel is light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a well done fruited sour. My only gripe would be that I think it’s just a touch too sour for me.	4.35
5170	Kiwi Herman	"L: Slightly hazy golden and dark peach hues with a frothy white head and minimal lacing/retention
S: Ripe strawberries with a mild funk
T: Crisp and clean strawberry profile up front that is supported by a healthy dose of Belgian yeast and finishes with a refreshing sour kiwi smoothness
F: Medium to light bodied with ample carb
O: Enjoyable and crisp tart fruited sour - Alpine did an incredible job with this one. Likely perfect for a hot summer day, but it does wonders on a cold winter evening as well!"	4.67
5171	Kiwi Herman	"I've had this a bunch all batch 1. It's like sour snapple kiwi strawberry
Nose smells like sour strawberry
Taste is kiwi strawberry nice Smooth taste.
Nice color. Mouth feel is sour nice fruit forward sour."	5
5172	Kiwi Herman	L: Pours a golden/copal with minimal head. S: Kimi and strawberry, in that order. T: Terrific sour notes melding with a sweet, almost candied fruit flavor, first coming with a wave of kiwi, then finishing with strawberry.  404 characters	4.71
5173	Kiwi Herman	500ml bottle. Served in a stemmed glass.. Pours a light straw yellow body, one finger white head with good retention; medium collar with no lacing. Smells of mostly the base sour blonde, with lactic acid, a bit of grainy cereal sweetness, faint strawberry fruit sweetness. I couldn't find the kiwi there, but I think the acetic aspects of it is interspersing in with the lactic acid on the aroma. Flavour brings out a little bit more of the strawberry, which is subtle still. It's there, kind of like a acetic strawberry flavoured yogurt with a small drizzle of lemon and oak; then the strawberry fades and there is a moderate acetic and lactic acidic kick that finish things off. It's interesting, and it kinda works. It's certainly different. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat creamy, fades a bit on the finish as the sour fades, leaving not a whole lot to ponder. It's a relatively simple beer that I believe accomplishes the intent of the brewer, which is to integrate strawberry and kiwi in a sour blonde without trying to blow peoples' palates away.	4.23
5174	Kiwi Herman	This is one of the rare beers that I will say is worth the hype. This is in my top 5 sour beers. The nose start with a 50/50 blend of sweet and sour. The sour is acidic, citrus, and farmhouse. The sweet is strawberry, caramel, and tropical fruit. The flavor matches but brings the beer to the next level. The balance and flavor is nearly unparalleled. There is the sour and tart from the microflora that is the best of any sour out there. The sweetness from the fruits is there. The strawberry is more dominate then the kiwi but both are present. Well done Alpine, I hope they bring this beer back.	4.88
5175	Kiwi Herman	split this bottle with my buddy paul. really nice and delicate sour with nice kiwi notes. the thing that makes it dance in your mouth is the strawberry. I find that strawberry is a hard flavor to convey well in a beer and this one kills it. very good, but not sure it was worth the price of admission.	4.5
5176	Kiwi Herman	Poured light golden. Nose mostly of strawberry. I think the Kiwi was thrown in just for the name. Taste follows nose, medium tartness, uneventful. Thin body. Not much going on in this beer, very forgettable other than the fact that it rode the Chez train giving the ultimate testament to name hype.	4.03
5177	Kiwi Herman	Aroma is distinctly kiwi and strawberry but has a hint of artificiality to it that bothers me; a kind of candied, crystal light fruit tone ... bag of Haribo gummy candies. Flavor is light and clean, spritzy and refreshing, light balanced acidity. Drinks more like an artisinal Bartles & James / wine cooler than a beer. The base is transparent to the point of being virtually non-existent. Tasty but something of a novelty, lacking in real complexity.	4.24
5178	Kiwi Herman	Pour is a nice light golden amber with a medium white head that lasts a couple minutes. Aroma is a slight kiwi presence with a good amount of oak and white grapes. The strawberry kiwi combo comes through in the flavor and balances the oak and acetic acid nicely with a good middle of the road sourness. Mouthfeel is very effervescent, great overall.	4.69
5179	Kiwi Herman	This one has been very elusive for me and I was excited to try it. (And with great thanks to the person who opened it at our tasting 8/22/15; very generous of you).. However, I simply do not get the hype or ratings or reviews for this beer. Don't get me wrong - it's a decent wild ale, but that's about it. One person's assessment was that it was highly rated since it is so difficult to use strawberries and get some strawberry character into the beer. Perhaps. However, I still really don't get it.. Pours a light amber with an extremely fast fading head. Nose is extremely modest of fruit and there is a hint of strawberry. Candidly, it may be there because you want it to be there, not because it really is. Nose is pleasant, acidic and typical of most good American sours/wild ales..  1,673 characters	3.59
5180	Kiwi Herman	Great nose of strawberry and can even get the kiwi if I look for it along with some woody wine barrel notes. Taste is very similar. Tart fresh strawberry, some sour kiwi. wine barrel and very light funk. Thanks so much cocoapuph!!	4.4
5181	Kiwi Herman	Pour is golden amber with a fizzy white head. Nose has a moderate oak presence, fleshy kiwi fruit, white grape, hint acetic. Flavor follows suit, nothing excessively bright but nothing glaringly wrong. Light plastic phenol is blended with oak and white grapes, slightly vinous, kiwi is fleshy and ripe, lightly acetic through the finish. Soft body, moderate carb, a touch syrupy and heavy.	3.42
5182	Kiwi Herman	Definitely get the strawberry--get the sour of the kiwi but not so much the sweetness. Had it fresh and then again about 3 months old. Definitely better fresh.	4.25
5183	Kiwi Herman	Bottle shared by ygtsbm94. Thanks Brad!. Golden yellow body, mild haze, small collar that fades rapidly. Aromas of tart citrus, kiwi, lime. Delicious flavor. Light and tart. Strawberry finish. Fruity with a mild acetic character. Nice.	4.45
5184	Kiwi Herman	Was not as impressed by this as I had hoped. This is a good beer, but the flavors were a bit muted. The hype around this far exceeded its taste. Very good beer, but there are many others of similar quality. The best part was the funk at the bottom, which is where the flavors really came through.	4.24
5185	Kiwi Herman	Bottle shared by Curran tonight, thanks man.. This one pours a light orange, with a quarter inch head, and no lacing.. This one smells so unbelievably strawberry forward, with a little bit of kiwi, and some fresh lactic sourness. Smells really clean and nice..  794 characters	4.81
5186	Kiwi Herman	Opened up this bottle last night after sitting on it for a few months.. Absolutely stunning, strawberries and kiwi are still very present and the tartness gives it a nice balance. Nicely carbonated and nice vibrant color.	5
5187	Kiwi Herman	A: Golden straw pour with a slight haze, but this one is mostly sunny. Frothy head fades in short order.. S: Well, take me back to high school. It's Snapple's kiwi strawberry. But instead of my cafeteria, I'm in a hay field. The smell really starts popping as it warms and then starts leaning toward a somewhat artificial candy scent.. T: Bright fruit. Strawberry. Pop of sharp acid that mellows on the tongue with some vinous and oak notes. Alternating sweet and sour notes. If they made a strawberry sour patch kid I imagine it would taste like this..  706 characters	4.59

S - immediate aromas of onion and dank, overripe banana. Spicy, glazed grapefruit. Hint of lime and even some grape candy. Warming and toasted grains.. T - tropical and muggy in its juiciness.

Earthy grape and lactose sweetness with a hint of citrusy vanilla. A bit of melon on the finish, accompanied by sweet, buttery half and half cream..  881 characters	4.68
5191	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Pours an opaque pale orange that looks like a matte shade of wheat. Head is a finget of white foam, but disappates quickly. Aroma is big and bold tropical fruit that remain unchallenged or phased. Nectarine, tangerine, mango, orange and lemon all hit the nose in a barrage of citrus. Flavor profile is more citrus, but a little more refined and smooth here. Notes come via tangerine, orange, mandarin orange and nectarine. There is a little yeasty prominence at the finish, along with a bit of hop bite. The bite is staccato and short. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a pillowy texture. Overall, lots of tropical fruits and yet it feels refreshing and not overwhelming.. Draft.	4.46
5192	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"On tap at George Keeley, NYC.
Pours a turbid yellow color with a good sized fluffy foam head that retains amazingly. A ring of frothy lace adorns the glass throughout.
The Citra hops aromatics really shine through. Notes of orange, grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit, amidst a faint biscuit malt aroma.
The taste opens with citrusy notes of freshly squeezed orange, tangerine and grapefruit pulp. Notes of tropical fruit compliment these flavors with juicy sweet notes of pineapple and passion fruit. The initial sweetness soon becomes countered by a burst of zesty and spicy hops flavors, earthy, pithy, and with a subtle muted bitterness that carries a lime like acidity. The finish has a gentle hops burn, citrusy and dry and with notes of clean alcohol spice.
Medium full bodied with a mouthfeel that is both smooth and crisp. The moderate carbonation has a sting to it, that is complimented well by the hops spice.
Overall, great mono focus on the Citra hops. A juicy, zesty and spicy hops bomb that adds to the list of outstanding Other Half IPAs."	4.4
5193	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Poured into a snifter. A very hazy bright yellow color with a medium sized white head. Great lacing in the glass. The nose was bursting with tangerine, orange, and mango. Taste followed. Really fantastic bright fruit flavors. Some crackery malt and also subtle dank earthy notes. Feel was very soft and bitterness was low. A slightly thick but clean finish. Deserving of its reputation.	4.49
5194	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"16 oz can, dated 5/21/19. ""CONTROL ALT DELETE"" inscribed on the bottom of the can.. Purchased by a friend of mine at the brewery (thanks Jay!) and brought to my house for a BBQ.. Color ranges from pale gold to pale amber. Very cloudy - almost opaque - body, as expected. Large, persistent, creamy, white head..  637 characters"	3.94
5195	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"Four pack from brewery in Brooklyn (and on tap there) returned home to Alberta. Pours a bright milky golden yellow with 1 finger of head.
Aroma super fruity - mango, pineapple, orange with touch of sweaty dankness.
Taste is sweet citrus - mango, tropical, mild piney bitterness but still dank with notes of cantaloupe.
Medium full mouthfeel - smooth and very drinkable - what a hazy DIPA should be!"	4.31
5196	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Pours hazy yellow with solid citrus nose bursting with pineapple, hops and earthiness. A truly amazing Citrus IPA on or with all Tree House offerings.	4.5
5197	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"Pours hazy golden orange with two fingers of off white head.
Big mixed citrus nose, grassy, dank, pineapple.
Taste is sweet citrus, pineapple, dank, pithy citrus as well.
Medium to full body, smooth but the carbonation was a bit prickly.
Overall an excellent all Citra showcase!"	4.58
5198	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	From a 10-day-old can, pours a hazy greenish gold. Fruity and dank with a decent hit of bitterness. Smooth medium feel. Drinks like a much lower ABV beer. Great stuff.	4.35
5199	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"**
09/07/18. IPA tasting with DC. #3.. Look: Bright yellow, creamy honey look..  309 characters"	4.25
5200	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	The lactose in this really adds something positive, as apposed to so many beers. Add a ton of hops and you have a great beer. This showcases everything great about Citra and masks everything bad.	4.55
5201	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	On tap at Brewskival 2018.. Pours a hazy bright yellow with fine, soft foam.. Smell is citrusy and dank, with notes of grass and pineapple..  469 characters	4.49
5202	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Poured from a 32 oz growler into a teku glass.. Pours an opaque golden straw color with a finger of effervescent white head. The head leaves a few spots of lace before settling into a thin sheet.. The aroma is a melon fruit cocktail; honeydew, cantaloupe and watermelon, followed by some grapefruit and orange rind..  1,005 characters	4.69
5203	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	5/9 batch so certainly not the freshest but definitely smooth and nice sweetness but missing on the nose and overall taste- didn’t meet expectations	4.04
5204	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	So I sat at a share table with friends for about three hours before I was even aware that we had a can of DDH All Citra Everything - a long time wish list item. Towards the end of the evening, we had to decide between this can, and Ethereal Haze. We eventually drank them both, of course - but DDH All Citra stands head and shoulders above every IPA I had that evening.. Chewy, sweet, loaded with citrus in the nose and taste, All Citra is dangerously easy to drink and doesn't feel heavy or reflective of it's actual ABV, which is not insignificant. I could see this quickly sneaking up on me after several cans.. I have a fridge full of 12 new-to-me IPAs at the moment... but since drinking this can, I have zero motivation to drink those IPAs. This beer really sets the bar for single-hop Citra IPAs. I'd love to have a whole lot more of this beer!	4.75
5205	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	On tap at Other Half.. Hops: Citra. Not a pretty beer. Very dull, chicken stock appearance. Everything else is great though. I'm a citra whore and maybe was expecting this to be better based on hype. Or we're all just spoiled these days with options. A great beer, but not life shattering.	4.28
5206	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"DDH All Citra Everything - Other Half
DDH IPA - 8.5% abv
Canned 2/6/18 (25 days ago). L - 1-finger offwhite head atop an opaque murky, dirty yellow body.. S - powerful citrus, pineapple, melon, a little booze. This thing smells amazing!.  723 characters"	4.22
5207	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Pours a bright hazy straw yellow with a soapy white head. Nose is vibrant. Citrus juice and lemon zest with hints of malt. Taste of citrus peel, orange, lemon and grapefruit. Nice solid malt base that shines through just enough in this beer to balance it out. Creamy silky mouthfeel. Very smooth beer. Love it as I love me some Citra!	4.51
5208	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	This beer really shows why Citra is such an amazing hop. Also Other Half did a great job leaving just a touch of bitterness on the finish after all that juicy fruit up front. This was most excellent.	4.31
5209	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	"Look: Yellow, hazy with 2 inch head.
Smell: Lemon, tangerine, citrus, and melon.
Taste: Lemon, a little sweet, tangerine, citrus, and melon.
Mouthfeel: Soft and pillowy.
Overall: A fantastic IPA from Other Half. It might be my favorite IPA from these guys."	4.71
5210	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	16oz. can into a Surly teku.. Nose is wonderful! Aromas of cane sugar, citrus fruit, clementine sweetness and a dank hop presence. Very aromatic. Beer opens intensely juice. Notes of orange, starfruit and pineapple. Like an overripe tropical bouquet. More malt body in the middle that carries a touch of honey and a light, fruity tartness at the finish. No hop presence at all. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Dry and prickly on the palate and bone dry going down.. Very good though at time I wish the flavor profile were a little more on the clean side. Still excellent though.	4.31
5211	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Canned 9 days ago.. A: Pours straw-colored opaque with a finger of dense, white head. Excellent retention and intricate lacing.. S: Bright tangerine, intricate floral aroma with a bit of mango, grapefruit, and very light, crackery malt..  642 characters	4.75
5212	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	Poured from the can into a taster. Prominent classic citra flavors as expected, solid but unspectacular mouthfeel. A bit boozy but fairly well hidden at 8.5% ABV.	4.4
5213	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	16 oz can. Pours cloudy yellow orange with thick lasting foamy head and coating lace. Juice bomb thru the aroma and taste. Juicy n sweet up front, dry n dank in the back. Whoa! This IPA is outstanding.	4.71
5214	Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything	32oz growler from the brewery. Pours an opaque pale yellow with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Dank aroma with lots of citrus. Lemon, tangerine, lime, grapefruit and orange. The taste is sweet citrus with some dank and piney hops. Pink grapefruit, sweet tangerine and orange along with some lime zest. Grapefruit and orange finish with a dry mouthfeel. Low bitterness and mild alcohol warmth. Lots of juicy citrus. Another winner.	4.29
5215	Birth Of Tragedy	22 oz bottle poured into flute glass.. Black with little to no lacing.. Nose: bourbon and vanilla up front, coffee. Some chocolate undertones. Tons of depth and very rich.  323 characters	4.45
5216	Birth Of Tragedy	Kochere variant (apple brandy) - drank 7/13/2019. Bottle opened at Hill Farmstead - incredible surprise. Best beer of the weekend. Layered, rich, amazing apple brandy. So incredible.	5
5217	Birth Of Tragedy	Black color with creamy brownish head. Aroma is spicy with some liquorice and aromatic herbs. Also dark fruits and whiskey. Taste is bittersweet, roasty, chocolate forward with well integrated bourbon. Medium to full bodied with soft mouthfeel. Overall it's a really well balanced and tasty beer.	4.6
5218	Birth Of Tragedy	Slick oily black with a seemingly headless, smooth silky surface that slowly develops a thin mocha film and a bubbly collar.. The aroma of spiked dark mocha pairs well with the charred oak and sophisticated bourbon that comes with the excellent aging Hill Farmstead has done here. Fire roasted marshmallow and vanilla add a new level of decadence, while some spiced, dusty cinnamon emerges as it warms.. Unbelievably deep, complex and luscious flavors of toasted coconut and nougatty yet dry and charred roasty wood mingle with some spicy, black peppery bourbon, while the cacao and cinnamon come out as light accents on the back end, with mocha becoming more apparent at room temperature..  1,241 characters	4.31
5219	Birth Of Tragedy	Hill Farmstead is plain and simply the best brewery I have ever been to. I would say that it is the best of all time but who really knows? Everything I have had from there, I'm not sure if you could find anything wrong with it.	5
5220	Birth Of Tragedy	2016 batch, hard to tell what month due to a smudge on the date stamp. The honey is still a standout, lending a natural sweetness and floral aroma as a counterpoint to the base porter's roasted bitterness, and drying out the finish. The earthy, nutty coffee is less obvious on the nose but still shows up on the palate, alongside an obvious, but not dominating, bourbon and oak character from the barrel. Moderately full body with an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel.	4.34
5221	Birth Of Tragedy	Bottled 9.21.16, almost a year old. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a hill farmstead tulip. Purchased at the brewery.. Pours a deep brown body with a nice, frothy three finger heads that reduces to a ring of foam and leaves spotty lacing.. Aromas are very inviting, sweet bourbon, coffee, milk chocolate, honey, sweet vanilla. On the tongue it's pretty sweet, caramel and sweet milk chocolate, developing into vanilla and bourbon, chocolate cake, coffee. The finish is roasty and charred, a lightly bitter coffee / toasted malt flavor that sticks on the tongue for a while. Mouthfeel is rich but not too thick, sweet and decadent. Medium-low carbonation..  794 characters	4.44
5222	Birth Of Tragedy	Sep. 2016 Batch. Says to drink within 6 months. Oops. At least I kept it cold. 500 mL bottle poured into snifter and let warm.. L: Pours completely dark with 1F tan head with good retention. Leaves no lacing, but persistent cap and ring.. S: Bourbon barrel, honey, coffee, and roasted malts. Always odd to have honey and coffee together, but it seems to work here..  1,073 characters	4.45
5223	Birth Of Tragedy	'16 batch, I think.. This one pours a dark silky looking black, with a small head, and just a little bit of lacing.. Smells just absurd- honey, bourbon, maple sugar, oak, vanilla, fruity coffee, dark chocolate, etc..  887 characters	4.81
5224	Birth Of Tragedy	"2011 version. Had a 4 oz pour at the brewery.
L: Close to black. Not much head, but the thin line did stay around for a while.
S: Mildly spicy coffee, oak.
T: Chocolate and coffee. Oak barrel, and a little bit of booze to it, but that seems to have settled to the background.
F: Super Smooth and rich.
O: so it's 6 years old. Older than my 2 kids lol. Had to argue with the wife over how much she was allowed to drink :)"	4.65
5225	Birth Of Tragedy	Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a deep brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee with some bourbon notes and nice vanilla notes. Taste is a complex and rich mix of nice vanilla notes with bourbon and rich black chocolate notes and a sweet honey-laced finish. Body is full with deep oily texture and good carbonation with hints of warming alcohol notes. Very rich porter but a bit too much honey for my taste.	4.21
5226	Birth Of Tragedy	Most recent batch bottle poured into fluted snifter.. Very dark, near black and mostly opaque. Not thick, but able to block light out effectively. Head is light brown and settles slowly.. Aroma has hint of spice, medium roast coffee and floral sweetness. The oak is definitely noticeable with just a slight hint of the booze after warming..  693 characters	4.49
5227	Birth Of Tragedy	"Had this one at a tasting a ways back, from notes
Cinnamon, nutmeg, more wood then bourbon, coffees late, honey comes through as maple, licorice, a little smoke in the mouth but it might just be burnt coffee, sticky on the lips…"	4.44
5228	Birth Of Tragedy	"Vintage 2016.
Pours opaque and near black. A half inch beige head forms and settles as a thick ring on top and leaves strands of lace. The smell is of burnt wood and faint coffee. The taste is of roasted malt, honey, black cherries, coffee and subtle bourbon notes. Thick texture with medium carbonation. I was expecting more coffee presence. This is a world class porter nonetheless."	4.28
5229	Birth Of Tragedy	i've had this guy before and thought it was alright. this is the most recent batch. 500ml poured into a perfect stout glass. looks good in the glass, completely dark with a khaki head. darker than expected.  706 characters	4.43
5230	Birth Of Tragedy	This one was a slight disappointment, all honey, no coffee, maybe I should have drank it sooner but you figure a BA Porter would hold up with in 6 months of bottling. Not bad, but did not live up to its billing	4.06
5231	Birth Of Tragedy	most recent batch (didn't note the date) drank on 3/4/2017. L-not overly thick, deep dark brownish black, tan head. S/T-BOOM! just fantastic combination of heavy oak, bourbon and milk chocolate, with some additional sweetness coming through from the honey and a hint of vanilla too and the coffee is subdued. Boy this is glorious.  527 characters	4.65
5232	Birth Of Tragedy	From bottle. Near black. Dark head dissipated to slicks. Smell is elegant. Good, clean malts. Surprised this isn't BA. Has a rich caramel and vanilla element. Sweet and smooth. HF feel never disappoints. Great beer.	4.48
5233	Birth Of Tragedy	Dark pour with a tan head that leaves a ring around the glass as you drink it. Roasted malts and coffee on the nose with some bourbon barrel. Honey sweetness blends nicely with coffee, oak, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and bourbon. My lips were sticky after the first sip. A nice, thick body on this beer. Overall, a very tasty beer.	4.53
5234	Birth Of Tragedy	"Beautiful pitch black pour with a moderate khaki head
Smell of honey is up front, back end a hint of barrel and almost nutmeg
Wonderfully complex, a bit of vanilla, coffee and a spice I can't but my tongue on (maybe a touch of cardamom?) fades into sweet honey and a lovely bourbon finish with pleasant heat
For the style, the mouth feel is perfect not too thin, coating but drinkable
Overall, really glad I got to try this one and will certainly seek it out again"	4.72
5235	Birth Of Tragedy	Drinks like a stout. Dark roast flavors, and a really nice vanilla and bourbon added from the barrel. Complex as a porter can be. Don't expect a huge BA stout, it is a porter after all, but if you want a well made example of an imperial with stout like characteristics, this is the one.	4.49
5236	Birth Of Tragedy	This thing is way under the radar. Black pour, thick dense head, and lots of bourbon and vanilla to enjoy on the nose and palate. Smooooothness and Drinkability is the story on this one!	4.6
5237	Birth Of Tragedy	Pours black with tan head. There's some barrel aroma, vanilla and booze. It really is super balanced, delicate, and well finessed. The honey seems to subdue the barrel character or at least keep it from being as heavy handed as some other BBA stouts. There's some chocolate in there too. It's super smooth to the point where the bourbon punch is a pinch. BoT is just a phenomenal porter.	4.54
5238	Birth Of Tragedy	This shit is the truth! Poured into a stemmed Hill Farmstead balloon glass. Pitch black small amount of khaki head. Nice coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate nose. It's best attribute is taste, everything comes together, such balance... a real masterpiece! Mouthfeel is excellent medium/full - full, low carb. Overall one of HF's best offerings!	4.89
5239	Birth Of Tragedy	Nice complex taste with this beer. Really well done and I think underrated. Not too sweet at all and the coffee notes are perfect. Great smell and the body is amazing.	4.34
5240	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours pitch black in color with a bigger, bubbly dark brown head.. Inherits aromas of nacho cheese, almonds, a load of cinnamon and a good amount of oaken, alcohol soaked oak. Carries its spices in a headstrong fashion, leaning on bakers chocolate and green peppers in a very convincing way, enhanced by a gentle toffee sweetness.. Drinks initially smooth, with a late carbonation spark, featuring a surprisingly thin body, which feels inappropriate, compared to the beer‘s full swing chili-barrel hotness..  1,162 characters	3.45
5241	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark brown head. Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.. This thankfully doesn't have that odd, floral chili note that normal Huna has, the chilies feeling a lot more sharp and spicy. A little less earthy and bitter as well, with more vanilla sweetness and a lot more booziness. slightly richer dark fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel is actually quite a bit worse though, not having quite that thick, almost viscous quality to it that normal Huna has. Still quite smooth though. I actually think that the heat from the chilies and the booze work together quite well to create quite an aggressive character works well with the bitterness and is balanced out nicely by a certain sweetness from the vanilla.	4.39
5242	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"L - Pours a pitch black with light brown head.
S - Spicy and hot probably from the peppers and bourbon
T - Very complex. Changes the more you drink and in mouth. Spice and dark chocolate.
F - Smooth with bite at the end
O - Really great. the bourbon barrel makes this a stand out."	4.66
5243	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Thanks to james for trading that magnum BART to score all these Cigar City beers and Hunahpu variants. Will return the favor.. Pours black. Brown head, cola in appearance, 1/2"" deep. Retention ain't too shabby. The aroma is a hot stinging dose of alcohol first, then roasted malt, chile pepper, wet oak, cinammon. There is a lot going on in the nose, I seriously think I sniffed it 4 times in the first 60 seconds because each time it revealed more about the beer. Thankfully we cracked this one a little more leaning to the room temperature side of things.. The taste like the aroma came through as hot on the first sip. There was also a substantial amount of bitterness, this thing seemed to be clocking in around the 90 ibu range, tons of roasted barley in here and I guess a decent degree of hopping to get it into that range. There isn't the smoothness of a vanilla factor here, and the cacao nibs similarly get swallowed up by more domineering parts of this beer. Previous iterations seemed to have more pepper heat, but I dunno, there's heat here in multiple ways, the alcohol first, then the pepper, each contributing to the overall burn and bitterness..  1,402 characters"	4
5244	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Slick, viscous motor oil black with a thin, fizzy mocha blanket that settles to a thin ring.. Smell still has that classic Huna cinnamon-chili pepper combo, with chocolate syrup and roasted nuts, but there is a sweet, maple-esque bourbon presence mildly running with it, as a touch more heat burns the nostrils.. On the palate, cinnamon and chilies are mellowed out behind an almost milky yet charred oak presence that allows dark chocolate to come more forward before a more peppery, spicy bourbon emerges, that again, has a maple-like influence to it. Notes of coconut and vanilla also come through, even before it warms. It's quite a surprising improvement over an already special beer, particularly because of the less potent pepper presence..  898 characters	4.6
5245	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Tasted from bottle. 17 version. Black with minimal beige head. Aroma is a little smokey, roasted, bourbon, cured meats, bourbon. Flavors of bourbon, toffee, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, slight chili. Complex and delicious.	4.7
5246	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin film of khaki head that immediately recedes. The carbonation is low. It smells of chocolate, mocha, chilli peppers, cinnamon, hint of vanilla, and bourbon. The beer tastes of chocolate, chilli peppers, mocha, cinnamon, bark, with a bourbon kick. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, lots of complexity and so smooth. This is a special beer, there aren’t many big stouts that I could drink all day and this is one of them.	4.55
5247	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	750ml bottle, 2017 release. Bottling date of 08/16/18 etched on the neck of the bottle. Bourbon and oak dominate the nose with more moderate notes of cinnamon and peppers. The smell definitely gets better as it warms with the bourbon barrel notes dominating and also the cinnamon, chile peppers, and cacao nibs that make the regular Hunahpu’s so amazing are hiding behind the barrel notes. The taste is all the great flavors of Hunahpu’s with a slightly spicy and warming finish.	4.6
5248	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	750ml bottle, 2017 release, poured into a stemless wine glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a jet black color, crazy thick and super viscous with a thick finger of head, low retention with a few spots of lace. The aroma is nice, tons of fudge, light heat, tons of cinnamon, smooth barrel, light char, mild vanilla and a really nice rich grain aroma. The flavors are excellent, tons of cinnamon, crazy thick fudge, super rich and decadent with ample bourbon barrel offering some caramel and charred oak, a nice vanilla presence with rich grains, stone fruits and a nice hint of vanilla as well. The mouthfeel is perfect, coating, thick full body, creamy and incredibly smooth with a warm and lightly spicy finish.. Verdict: A world class rendition of Hunahpu from Cigar City. Insane depth to this beer, tons of complex flavors that super balanced and expressed so well and the mouthfeel and body really take this to new heights. Just a delicious beer.	4.52
5249	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2017 vintage. Tremendous taste and nose. Light coconut, spice, plenty of cinnamon. Not a very pronounced barrel presence, but it's there. It's surprising how excellent this is, but being a fan of the base beer, it should probably be expected.. Well done, Cigar City. I know a lot of people look past Huna these days - it's impossible to overlook BA Huna!	4.71
5250	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	750ml bottle, of the 2017 release (blue El Catador label). Served in a Cigar City snifter glass. Pours a dark motor oil black body, half finger mocha head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Big legs on this bad boy. Smell is rich bourbon and chocolate fudge; the bourbon is a smooth and slightly warming presence, oak and charred caramel. Milk chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and touch of cocoa rounds it out. It's a very smooth, well-integrated bourbon barrel on the aroma working with the base beer. Flavour is a bit muddled, however. I get a bit of milk chocolate and a touch of cinnamon up front, with a more astringent and bitter cocoa. Hunahpu's has never been a super cinnamon forward beer, and it shows here. There is mostly milk chocolate, cocoa, and a fair bit of whiskey flavour and heat. A bit of vanillin perhaps thickens up the mouthfeel on the backend some. I do notice a fair bit of extra heat on the backend, that lingers for a little bit after you've finished your sip, a bit of a sting to it. Pretty solid, and the balance is what I remember the base beer to have, except the bourbon adds on an additional dimension. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick-bodied, lower in carbonation but adequate, oily with a bit of whiskey and pepper heat on the finish. A fun beer to finally tick, even if it took until the 2017 release to do so.	4.4
5251	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bourbon is soft, well balanced and tones down the cinnamon, chocolate and other notes. Silky smooth mouth feel; easy on the palate. Worth the bottle...Prost!!	5
5252	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Shared with friends at CBC Como on 1-27-18. 2017 version(blue label). Pours about as black as it gets with no real head to speak of. Great nose, with hints of cinnamon and spice predominant, and a hint of barrel. From there, I guess I was a bit let down. Having the regular version on a few occasions, I was expecting the barrel treatment to give this beer a boost. Instead, the flavors come off a little muddled. Yes, I got some cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies(most unaffected), but they were struggling to the forefront with the presence of the barrel itself.	4.33
5253	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours opaque black with no head, just a tight band around the edges. Nose reveals rich chocolate and ethanol. Taste expresses cocoa, cinnamon, honey and a kiss of heat. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation. Overall, a solid offering. I'm not a huge fan of chili stouts; however, this was pleasant and unassuming.	4.15
5254	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"L: Pitch black pour with no head
S: bourbon and cinnamon, then chocolate and spices
T: the spices really pop, slight vanilla with the cinnamon dominating with mild bourbon barrel. I wish the barrel was bigger is my biggest knock.
F: very thick, spices warming and sticky. Not the smoothest barrel though."	4.53
5255	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottled on 08/16/17 - poured into Wander coliff glass. Absolutely one of the best beers I've had, hands down, and the best of the year for me. Trumps the bourbon paradise from a couple days ago as my best beer of the year. Looks black on the pour with a small mocha head. It dissipates quickly, but smell still is in full force. Fudge and vanilla. Chipotle roasted almonds pops off first. The taste has a bit of Bourbon barrel and smoked peppers. The pepper fades and the vanilla and chocolate dominates the taste. It all melds with the barrel well. Every sip better than the next. The warmer this gets, the hotter this beer gets. Odd complexity, but it's warily welcome as the shift change comes into play. Don't think anything is going to beat this for the rest of the year.	4.8
5256	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2017 batch drank on 11/12/17. Overall, an elite beer. Glad I was finally able to try this after not being able to snag one from the last batch. This black body with a minimal head. Maybe the darkest beer I’ve had. The flavor in this are near perfect. The Huna base all comes through but more in a low to medium presence rather than bold. This allows the barrel to shine through really nicely. The dark chocolate from the base molds perfectly with the bourbon barrel. Fudgy, semi spicey, and mild cinnamon and vanilla. Delicious.	4.71
5257	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Most recent batch - sampled from a 750mL bottle at room temperature. Thanks Mike for sharing.. Pours a thick black body, opaque with little head or retention. Aromas are big bourbon, fudge, cocoa, vanilla. Taste follows the nose with a ton of fudgy goodness with vanilla, milk chocolate, and roastyness on the finish. Not getting a ton of spices which is my only gripe. Great body, rich and thick with low carbonation.	4.43
5258	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2017 release (El Cat Round 7).. A: Pours a viscous black with a smattering of dark brown head. Leaves a razor-thin ring which lasts for a decent bit.. S: Cinnamon in the forefront, loads of dark cocoa, charred oak, light bourbon and vanilla, and a bit of pepper/alcohol burn in the nose as well..  1,001 characters	4.4
5259	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I’ve been eagerly awaiting this moment since the first time I tongued the original batch at the brewery in early 20…10, I believe. And now it’s here. It’s like Christmas porn! Split with my wife.. Angels whisper in anticipation as the black liquid flows into my glass, oh, wait, my wife’s glass too. I take a few secret sips of hers, & a little I leave in the bottle too (don’t tell her – there are knives in the house & I sleep hard). Smells like sweet bourbon aged cinnamon. Is that a thing? It should be.. Hunahpu’s – Bourbon Barrel Aged is another phenomenal extension of a world-class beer. Everything from the base beer is here to some extent: cinnamon (ramped up), vanilla (really ramped up), chilis (quieter), chocolate (quietest), though there is a bigger sweetness & a belly-warming alcohol wallop that regular Huna doesn’t pack. Bourbon wends its way through the ingredient list, not dominating, not wilting, but standing ass-to-ass with the great base beer, complementing it like Anthony Weiner snapchatting a 16 year old. The heat doesn’t build in the mouth, but down there where acid reflux starts. Thick. So easy to drink, I might not tell my wife there’s a second bottle. Anybody know a good lawyer?.  1,405 characters	4.85
5260	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Really happy to see CCB restore some BA greatness again. Rich, luscious, and so smooth. Waves of chocolate creaminess, smooth bourbon, and the lasting finish or peppers without too much heat. Perfect blend for my taste. They nailed it.	4.79
5261	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"This was a 2013 Huna drank on 1/9/16
Incredibly smooth with rich plum flavours, super smooth Bourbon backbone with no alcohol presence what so ever. Never gave a beer a perfect score before but this absolutely blew my mind."	5
5262	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"A - some say ""Motor Oil."" Let me specify. Old used diesal truck motor oil is much more accurate. Just an awesome pour.
S- Wow! Big chocolate covered brandy soaked cherries. Roasty malt. Just..wow
T - This beer is an assault on your pallet. Dark but sweet chocolate right up front. Then boom, a shot of brandy. Where the hell did that come from? Then a dark roast coffee with a lick of vanilla cool things down for the heat. Heat is mild and fades in about 30 seconds leaving you begging for the next sip to take this ride all over again.
M - thick, smooth, low carb. *Easy ladies, talking beer* coats pallet and stays after beer continues the journey to the liver. Liver smiles.
O- love it. Feel fortunate that Hal with The Top restaurant, Gainesville (shameless plug) gave me the opportunity to taste this remarkable example of what Fl. Breweries are producing. World class all the way."	4.94
5263	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Drank at NWIBDU tasting. Thanks!. S - Bourbon, vanilla, light pepper and cinnamon 4.25. T - Caramel, dark fudge, light bourbon sweetness, cinnamon spice but not as much as the cinnamon. Light astringency in the finish where the booze is more prominent than normal 4.5.  457 characters	4.35
5264	Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	750 mL bottle poured into a tumbler.. Appearance - Viscous inky black. Stains the glass. Nice mocha head.. Smell - Still surpringly peppery. Not distinct pepperiness. Chocolate. Light bourbon. Vanilla. Not a ton of barrel..  617 characters	4.11
5265	Tweak	Batch #1 bottle from Toby. Silky black pour, flat. Roasty, sweet, chocolate boozy aroma. Taste gets better, smooth, velvety, warm. Hits all high marks.	4.41
5266	Tweak	"Wow, just wow.
2 years old bottle of this beauty.
Complexity and balance between the coffee, the fresh bourbon and the pungent malts.
The mouthfeel is incredible.
Better and better as it warms up."	4.84
5267	Tweak	"Poured a dark brown/nearly black with two fingers of mocha head. 
Smells of coffee, chocolate, dark roasty malts. 
Taste follows with the roasty flavors, dark malts, coffee, slightly sweet notes of caramel and vanilla.
Fuller body with good carb levels. Smooth and well balanced.
Overall a nice one."	4.47
5268	Tweak	"12oz bottle. Bottled on 'NOV 14 2016'.
Dark brown colored body, with a big edge of mahogany when back lit. One finger of light tan head, settles back to creamy cap. Leaves behind a scattered array of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts and coffee. There is also chocolate, bourbon oak, and slight vanilla.
Taste is heavy on the bourbon barrel, but it blends well with the chocolate and vanilla. The coffee is more slight than in the smell. The front part of the taste is more smooth and slightly sweet, while the end turns more to the bitter/char of the coffee.
Medium plus mouthfeel. Quite smooth through the mouth. Good carbonation (the creamy head sticks around throughout the drinking of the beer).
While the ABV% is high, the booze is not hot, but rather is well blended with the other components. This is a comfortable sipper with the added coffee component."	4.46
5269	Tweak	"Has at least an average body, slight silky feel. Light amount of carbonation
Aroma is sweet bourbon,roasted malt,black coffee, alcohol, raisins and dark fruit
Taste is a nice blend of sweet bourbon balanced with roasted malt and bitter black coffee. Raisins and dark fruit add a great addition of flavor
Overall its smooth,nice bidy,great aroma and even better taste"	4.39
5270	Tweak	"Bottle dated 10/27/17 into pint glass. Pours an encouragingly inky black with a negligible head. Initial impression is incredibly smooth, sweet milk chocolate, espresso, bourbon, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is silky-smooth - almost literally oily. Alcohol - all 16% of it - is quite well hidden. Finish is smooth and sweet.
A lot of BBA stouts are over-the-top in the bourbon department. Not this one. Even the coffee is understated. Admittedly, this would be too sweet (and too potent) for frequent indulgence. But it's just perfect for the occasional indulgence."	4.54
5271	Tweak	Good but becomes too sweet as it warms. Lots of coffee and chocolate but the sweetness overwhelms. Booze is well integrated and surprisingly well hidden. Glad I tried but I prefer others over this one. The steep price kinda sucks as well.	3.99
5272	Tweak	*Bottled 9-14-18. Pours seal brown with a finger's worth of sudsy, mocha froth, which is about as robust a head as I've seen for 15% ABV. Powerful aroma smells primarily of coffee, currants, toffee, and molasses, with notes of toasted bread, chocolate chip cookies, brown sugar, and cherries thrown in for good measure—this is one of those rare brews where taking in the decadent aroma is an experience unto itself. Sheets of fine, reticulated lacing adorn the glass as the beer recedes.. As for the taste? I'm in flavor country... The juxtaposition of fresh-roasted coffee and bountiful sweetness is not only interesting, but substantial enough to mask its massive ABV. The coffee is not at all bitter or acrid, while the aforementioned sweetness is equal parts brown sugar and creme brulee. Warming reveals fruitier tones of black currants, dates, and figs, while rumors of alcohol finally manifest deep into the finish. The bourbon barrel is conspicuously understated, so much so that I nearly forgot this is a barrel-aged beer. That said, the extra layer or flavor is hardly necessary with everything else going on. Medium body and fine carbonation make for a smooth, fluffy mouthfeel that once more belies this beer's epic girth..  1,666 characters	4.56
5273	Tweak	12oz bottle dated 10/27/17. Poured into a tulip glass.. Pour: deep rich black/brown with a 2 finger tan head. Dissipates to some steady clouds and a thick ring. Plenty of lacing. Really nice.. Nose: plenty of sweet bourbon and malt. Dark fruit, some dark chocolate..  658 characters	4.41
5274	Tweak	"Serving: Bottle
Bottled: Jan-25-2016 (Consumed Jan-28-2019). 
A:
Pours a thick ruby-tinged black with a couple fingers of short-lived khaki head.
Little retention; speckled lacing. (4). S:
Candied coffee beans, candied nuts, dark chocolate, rum, vanillins, REALLY opens up as it warms. (4.5).  1,397 characters"	4.45
5275	Tweak	Tasted in a Rastal Teku from a 12 fl oz bottle on January 28, 2019. Batch #3 bottled November 2016. Stout with coffee added then aged in bourbon barrels.	4.46
5276	Tweak	"This monster of a beer is one I have wanted to try. Some of the first beers I drank was from Avery. Elle's Brown Ale was one of those fond beer memories back in the day. I served the beer in a tulip glass at 50 degrees. It would be a miracle if any head formed considered the high alcohol content. A vigorous pour produced a one finger medium tan head with fair retention. The beer's head took a couple minutes to dissipate and leaving no lacing on the glass. The head is creamy and foamy, settling to a thin ring around the glass. The color the beer is SRM 36 a dark brown to inky black. The beer is opaque.. The first aroma of the beer is dark coffee and bourbon. Further investigation I smell dark chocolate, roasted malts, char, subtle smokiness, molasses, malty sweetness, vanilla, earthiness, bready, burnt sugar, toffee, and toasty notes. This beer scares me, I can detect any of the high alcohol content.
Holy shit, the coffee is strong followed by the bourbon and vanilla. Next, I taste, malty sweetness, earthiness, wood, dark chocolate, bready, burnt sugar, toasty notes, a touch of char, a subtle note of smokiness, orange, and phenolic.
The mouthfeel of the beer is chewy a touch warming, and dry.
The body of the beer is full, low carbonation, and full finish.
This beer is an incredible feat of brewing. The strong alcohol content is well hidden in this beer. I do get some alcohol warming but not what I thought would take place. I love this beer it is awesome. The warmer it got the better it became."	4.6
5277	Tweak	Tweak is a great tasting Imperial Stout, coffee, bourbon, and it's strong, a bit on the sweet side. It is strong so watch out. Summary:. Look: black color with a quarter inch mocca colored head. Aroma: roasted malts, coffee, bourbon.  360 characters	4.49
5278	Tweak	Absolutely fabulous. This beer is a real treat. Very sweet and multi flavored. I get some aged raisin but there are so many things happening it's hard to describe e. High alcohol and you can taste it. Only plan to drink one (it's all you can afford anyway). Buy it!	4.92
5279	Tweak	"Old review that I never got around to adding.
Bottled November 14, 2018, drank June of 2017.. Dark ribbon into a snifter, fills into a black body with a finger thick cap of tan head. Hardly any legs, bits of lacing.
Smells like Mephistopheles (my favorite imperial stout for a long time) with a little bit of coffee and oak and a glob of molasses. Far less fruity. A little bit of bourbon and alcohol warmth.
Tsate is much more lively but hotter as well. Bourbon, oak, and chocolates with a bit of slightly bitter and fairly fruity fresh coffee, some vanilla and toffee and earthy leathery-ness. Again like Mephistopheles but less fruity, more earthy and bitter (coffee and tannin).
Fairly sweet aftertaste, very sweet overall for me actually, but with a good snappy bitterness, lingering bourbony oak (woody bourbon?) and coffee (Kahlúa-ish). Faint fruits.
Tweak has a much more effervescent, fluffy mouthfeel than most big imperial stouts I've had (at that point), and just as sweet as most but also very cloying, and it gets more cloying as it warms.. Very good, but the sugary, molasses globby sweetness and the bourbon and coffee all take away a lot of what I love about Mephistopheles without adding enough to get me to love Tweak. Maybe within a year or two the edges will smooth out and more flavors will develop, maybe even three (judging by other stouts I had aged)..  1,895 characters"	4.14
5280	Tweak	De Hopt. En copa Teku. Viendo Los 100 2x05-06. Asombrosa. La mejor integracion de barrica en una birra que he visto nunca, y eso que no soy mucho de madera ni bourbon. Los 16 grados de abv, disimuladisimos en sabor, aunque se sube algo a la cabeza	5
5281	Tweak	Very bright coffee and nuanced esters for such a big boozy beer. Bourbon barrel influence creates an almost apple pie note when combined with the coffee. Not all bitter or black malt here. More of an imperial porter with amazing wood - residual heat keeps it evolving as the beer warms up on the glass	4.35
5282	Tweak	Bottled 11/14/16; drank 10/10/18 @ the Yarchives.. Black appearance.. A rough pour yielded a nice tan head; a thick curtain of frothy, tree-rung lace..  451 characters	4.25
5283	Tweak	"Look - super dark almost black, no real head
Smell - very rich caramel coffee with some vanilla like it's a caramel latte frappuccino or something.
Taste - a lot like the scent. That pairing some how gets close to a dark fruit but no quite there... like a quad. suprised that you dont taste the booze as much as youd expect with a 16%ABV
feel - medium full syrup body with a very very light carbonation and slight creaminess
Overall - really yummy fantastic bber"	4.52
5284	Tweak	"12oz bottle.. A: deep ruddy brown, near black, with a thick, rich mocha colored head. A network of sticky lace was left down the glass.
S: rich decadent and smooth coffee notes with sweet bourbon and a hint of vanilla, caramel, and roast. Sticky sweet and full of coffee.
T: follows the nose with notes of rich and sweet bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and roast. Hints of creamy fudge and a kiss if chicory. Alcohol is mildly noticeable, smooth, with just a touch of warmth in the finish. Very well hidden for such a high percentage.
M: full body, rich and sticky mouthfeel, creamy and smooth carbonation. As stated, the alcohol is hidden very well.
O: decadent and smooth with a rich and bold flavor but very integrated and enjoyable. Easy to drink and smooth. A bit sweet and sticky. Similar to bcbcs but just a hair less polished."	4.53
5285	Tweak	Pours a pitch black coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smells of dark and lighter red fruit, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, toffee and brown sugar. Taste is similarily complex, but a little too sweet and boozy, dominated by the sweeter and barrel-heavy notes of vanilla, bourbon, toffee, molasses and brown sugar, with lighter notes of dark and red fruits: date, raisin, cherry, dark chocolate, coffee and oak. Finishes quite sweet, with a very light bitterness and quite a boozy bourbon aftertaste. Thick, oily mouthfeel with quite a rich body and low carbonation.. I would actually prefer Mephistopheles over this, which has a lot more interesting flavour profile that just gets muddled up by the strong, boozy bourbon notes of this. I will also say that, given the HUGE 17.8% ABV of the 2014 batch, this is *relatively* impressively mellow, but still slighty over the top for my personal taste. At the ned of the day, this just proves to me that BBA and added addjunks don't necessarily make things better. To me the subtle nuances of Mephistopheles get drowned out in a slightly to sweet and boozy brew here.	4.11
5286	Tweak	"Bottled: Nov. 14 2016
Liberated: Jun. 10 2018. Pours very dark brown to almost black. Not perfectly black, but pretty dark. The head is fairly thin and subsides to a nice little tan ring around the snifter.. The aroma is coffee, bourbon and vanilla, and it smells every bit like the 16% ABV boozy monster that it is..  1,149 characters"	4.62
5287	Tweak	"BOD 102717 Chocolate covered raisins and Kahlua. Warming alcohol with hints of vanilla and oak. So nice.
Again 2017 Batch 4 Strong smell of fresh coffee. Cocoa, coffee, vanilla and oak with more than a hint of alcohol."	4.5
5288	Tweak	Almost black with a a modest dark tan head that soon subsided to a ring around the edge. Aroma is dark chocolate, brown sugar & coffee. Taste is quit a bit sweet with a hint bitter & a substantial amount of alcohol heat. Flavor is dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, vanilla & bourbon (I doubt those bourbon barrels were empty before the aging process was started). Flavors are intense & pleasing, tastes stronger than 16%. Feel is smooth & thick, almost syrupy. The low amount of carbonation is made up for with a high level of alcohol, nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t really taste like a stout, but it is delicious.	4.44
5289	Tweak	"Pours almost black, minimal tan head that quickly fades to a small ring, no lacing but the glass retains a thin oily residue. Aroma has a little bourbon, coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla and some ash or smoke. Flavors match the aroma with a mildly boozy finish. I thought that this would be ""chewier"" but the texture is about as most BA stouts. Great flavor and aroma, surprisingly easy to drink considering everything. An awesome brew for sure@"	4.6
5290	Flora	Backlog from Quintessence 2018. Pours a clouded lighter yellow with almost no head at all.. Smells of faint grass, orange zest, moldy wood and a slighty acidic sourness..  785 characters	3.58
5291	Flora	Sparkling cider-like gold with a fizzy off-white foam quickly dying to a bubbling but clear surface.. Aroma is green apple, pear and herbal white wine oak--I can see why adding additional pear works so well with this. Faint notes of skunky cannabis blossoms as it warms, only adding a welcome touch of complexity.. Like an effervescent champagne, taste is white grape and tart apples with accents of peppery vinegar, without the acidity..  545 characters	4.25
5292	Flora	Batch 7. beautiful looking beer, hazed golden straw color, bright white head is dense but fizzes away quickly. aromas are just beautifully enticing and the flavors complimentary. there is a beautifully bright wine charter, lemon zest, mellow funky must quality, lactic, grassy, funky hay character, oak vanilla. just absolutely beautiful, a strong tartness to it. mouthfeel is zippy and crisp. 5++	5
5293	Flora	Bottle purchased for onsite consumption at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT. Batch 6, looks to have been bottled in 2014?. This one pours with a slightly hazed straw yellow color, with a bit of fluffy head and a little bit of lacing.. This smells like funky lemon candy, wheat, oak, earthy white wine, and dank citrus..  752 characters	4.66
5294	Flora	Florence is probably my favorite shelf Saison beer from HF so it's no wonder this one is amazing. It takes everything from the regular and amps it up with a nice tartness and oak character. Screams that HF signature funk with a bit of lemon/lime character as well.	4.6
5295	Flora	Wow. This is easily the best sour I've ever had. Pours bright red in the glass with a trace of head. Hill Farmstead funk without being overpowering. Loved it!!!	5
5296	Flora	Unsure of vintage. Poured into a HF bulb. Bright golden orange/yellow. Small head. Smells of oak and subtle funk. Some wine characteristics there as well. Flavor is so damn good. Some funk, tartness, white whine characteristics and oakiness. Amazing. Feel is spot on for the style. Lots of bubbles and very refreshing. Overall, a fantastic HF beer. Thanks George for sharing.	4.57
5297	Flora	Batch 7 drank on 12/29/17. Really a wonderfully done beer. The barrel comes through perfectly and that HF funk is totally present. I’d have to assume Chardonnay is the wine barrel with the nice lighter citrus coming through. Lemon and white peach and barnyard hay are all perfectly balanced. Lovely offering from the Hill	4.5
5298	Flora	"2014 vintage
Look: Bright clear yellow with 2 inch white head. Has medium low carbonation.
Smell: Pears, white wine, hay, and brett.
Taste: Lightly tart, Pears, white wine, hay, and minerals.
Mouthfeel: Light and complex.
Overall: A great wine barrel aged saison from Hill Farmstead."	4.7
5299	Flora	Pours a light yellow with a one inch white almost champagne like head. Smells of lemon predominantly. Exquisitely light tart with lemon oakiness and light character from the wine barrel. Probably the best saison I have ever had.	4.78
5300	Flora	I was extremely lucky to have been there to get this as an onsite pour. I am thankful. It was excellent. As usual, Hill Farmstead is the standard by which all breweries must measure themselves.	5
5301	Flora	Batch 2017. Bottled splited 4 ways. Very pale golden slighlty hazy liquid with a white head diminishing fast. Shy nose, winy, white grape, slight funk, tartness. Taste is quite disappointing, light body, light floral taste, some citrus sourness, white wine, I lot of hype around this one that I think doesn’t deserve it. Florence in my opinion deserves more respect for the taste vs price.	3.51
5302	Flora	This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light messy lacing sliding right on into the beer. The smell takes on a quick sour grape to bitter grapefruit and then a subtle grapefruit, semi-sweet grassy contour. Beautifully floral and then a lemony sweet to bitter aroma. The taste takes on the same aroma roaming into a florally bittersweet dry aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to hit as a good penetrator for the harshness. Overall, this isn't a saison but a really nice American Wild ale.	4.09
5303	Flora	Flora is clean, crisp, light, and tart, with smooth background tones of wine and oak. Its simple, and in it's simplicity adds meaning to all of its variants.	4.75
5304	Flora	"Light pink, strawberry hue
Wonderful nose, somehow vinous but not wine-like, fresh berries and funk and oak
Lightly tart and fruity, fantastically restrained flavors, not particularly sweet nor overly sour"	4.13
5305	Flora	Batch 6. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Hill Farmstead stemmed wine glass.. Pours a slightly hazy orange body with a big frothy white head that leaves spotty lacing and a layer of retention.. Aromas are mesmerizing, citrus and tart green apple, funk and oak, brett, peppery saison yeast. As it warms the aromas get more potent and inviting. Can't wait to try it..  696 characters	4.5
5306	Flora	Pours golden with nice carbonation. Rim of white head. Nice wine barrel aroma. Great lemon character with some vinous grapey undertones. Touch of wheat on the finish. This is such a delicate beautiful beer. I wish that Shaun brewed straight up regular Flora more often.	4.63
5307	Flora	"Batch 6 --- poured into a HF Tulip
Golden yellow, mostly clear, with a frothy white foam, which after it settles to a thin rim around the edges looks like it could be a miller lite.....
Nose of funky brett, apricot, and cat-wee...
Taste is tart apples, dried apricots, lemon, and funky-goodness...
Love this beer, have had it several times, missing the in-your-face concentration of Le Sarrasin, but not that far behind!"	4.5
5308	Flora	On tap at HF FOFA 2015. HF Taster glass. Clean, a hint of tartness, some oak, a little pepper and yeast. Endlessly drinkable. My favorite offering from HF at FOFA.	4.5
5309	Flora	Batch 4. Appearance is light gold with good carb. Great smell with some funk that has a bit of a gueuze-like character. Taste is tart, citrusy, and incredibly balanced. Get a little bit of wheat and a little bit of oak. Overall a fantastic saison that is head and shoulders above others I've had from Hill Farmstead.	4.55
5310	Flora	B6. Lovely hazy sunshine in the glass. The nose is bright, fresh and astringent -- lemon and minerals mostly. This a perfectly balanced beer that has citrus, pith, stone, vinous and oaky notes. Extremely smooth and endlessly drinkable. Another HF winner.	4.65
5311	Flora	On tap at Festival of Farmhouse Ales 2015. This was first time trying Flora (I had previously had the Blue/Black variant). While this doesn't quite reach the heights of Ann and Art, it is a tremendous barrel-aged saison. Wonderfully tart with a deep and complex flavor profile.	4.63
5312	Flora	Batch 6. Glowing golden yellow in color. Hazy in appearance. Brett, lemon, and grannysmith apple. Wine tang. Bright. Perfect level of sweetness and carb. Creamy feel. Balanced. Delicious.	4.31
5313	Flora	"750ml bottle, Batch #6, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 7.4.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. 
The beer pours a nice golden apricot color, lemon hues, hazy and cloudy with a large, billowy and soapy white head, about 3 fingers high that has fantastic retention and lace. The aroma is wonderful, tart wheat, oaky acidic wine character, loads of wildflower, mineral water, citrus fruits, and light berry esters. The flavors are great, wheaty and doughy malt, tartness right up front, lightly citrusy, rustic wildflower, saison yeast, wine barrel that is both earthy and acidic, chewy oak sweetness and hearty mineral water. Loads going on, plenty of nice saison base that plays really, really well with the wine character. The mouthfeel is quite nice, coating, super smooth, gentle carbonation, creamy, delicate, delightful tart finish.. Verdict: Another fantastic saison from Hill Farmstead and yet another example of Shaun's prowess with utilizing wine barrels. Plenty of complexity, brightness, nice tartness, very delicate, so refreshing and easy to drink."	4.51
5314	Flora	A very lovely saison. It has the nice tartness that is characteristic of HF saisons, leaving a bit of a pucker but not in a dominating way. Flavour contains grape, oak, lemon and peach, with a slightly dry finish, with the oak really coming out. The mouthfeel is also terrific - nice and lively without being irritating, a softness that makes it very pleasant to drink. Hard to be too complimentary of this beer - it is a terrific example of a saison, with the yeast playing a very large role and light fruit flavours dancing about. The barrel treatment is also well done - it is notably better than Florence, which is already a very good beer. A pricy bottle but certainly worth it - I would have bought more if they let me!	4.47
5315	Caffè Americano	"L - Pitch, opaque black with a thin dark tan head that dissipates quickly leaving behind no head.
S - Rich roasted, bitter espresso and coffee along with dark chocolate and roasted/toasted grains
T - Complex but follows the nose: Rich, roasted, bitter espresso and coffee up front and throughout along with notes of dark chocolate, and a slight hint of sweetness from the vanilla at the end. Fudge - very rich. Molasses and charred wood/smoke. Roasted and toasted malts/oats throughout.
F - Full bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation. Somewhat thick and oily but smooth. Somewhat leans more towards the medium end of the spectrum in terms of body.
O"	4.67
5316	Caffè Americano	Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Nearly black pour with 2 fingers of tannish head. Great lacing.. S: Rich and roasty. Coffee and chocolate..  545 characters	4.02
5317	Caffè Americano	Deep, dark, viscous stout. At first, the combination of roasted barley, somewhat bitter coffee and subtle sweet shadings of vanilla blend, giving the beer an interesting roll-out. After a few sips, the bitterness takes over, which makes the beer one-note. Solid yes, but I'm surprised by the world class rating.	3.75
5318	Caffè Americano	Tasted in a snifter from draft at The Vine on June 22, 2019. Bold, strong and dark. Made by adding vanilla and Tampa roasted espresso beans to a formidable double stout base.	4.29
5319	Caffè Americano	Appearance: Poured viscous motor oil with a thin layer of tan head that disappeared quickly.. Smell: Immediate notes of Americano coffee. Very robust, rich, and assertive to the nose. Coffee gives off bitter cocoa and slight dried pitted fruit. Just slight hints of fragrant vanilla. Overall very warm and inviting.. Taste: Robust coffee from start to finish. Even the aftertaste remains rich in coffee, leaving a roasty bitterness in the mouth. It's interlaced with semi-sweet chocolate, making it almost dessert-like yet still contributing a slight char and bitterness. There is also hints of smoke and dried cherries, enhancing the complexity. Maybe just trace of vanilla, nothing more..  856 characters	4.55
5320	Caffè Americano	Lots of chocolate malt & fudge, coffee / espresso is there but maybe just a little lacking, some slight smoky tobacco flavor on the back end adds a nice depth	4.27
5321	Caffè Americano	Pumped to find this for 6 bucks at a giant eagle on the way to a concert. Color on fleek deep dark toxic black thick and viscous with a 1/2 inch of froth. Smell is pretty good black roast coffee deep espresso and can't really pick anything else. Taste is a tough but as it warms mocha and coffee become more refined. Body is heavy of course and abv is a bit harsh.. Overall an awesome find But not sure I would get it again because to me it was the most coffee forward beer I have had in some time	4.32
5322	Caffè Americano	"Pours pitch black, nice mocha head. Huge espresso aroma. Massive coffee flavor, nice dose of chocolate,, touch of coffee bitterness, and a sweet vanilla finish. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a big surprise from CC. World class beer here.. 8/10/19
Bomber at the beach - thanks Roach
4.5 rating"	4.5
5323	Caffè Americano	Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass not sure when it was bottled and don’t care. Pours midnight black with a 2 plus finger head that falls at record speed and leaves no lace. 4. Smell is roasty coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and roasted hazelnut. 4. Taste follows alcohol upfront, cocoa nibs, Expresso beans, vanilla, toffee, and some hazelnut in the bold finish. 4.  697 characters	4
5324	Caffè Americano	Pours as black as ink with a 1-2 finger thick brown head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. It was surprising to see such little head retention.. Smells of fresh ground coffee, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, faint vanilla, cold press coffee, smoked malts, charred wood or campfire smoke, cocoa powder, cream and hazelnut coffee. It's so complex it almost seems barrel aged. Really nice delivery of all things coffee, this is a pleasure to breath in.. Flavor is as good as the nose with fresh ground coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, roasted coffee beans, espresso, cold pressed coffee, smoked malts/grains, charred wood, campfire smoke, hazelnut coffee, cocoa powder, cream and the additions of toffee, molasses, dark fruits, roasted nuts, milk chocolate, and Raisinetes. The bitterness from the coffee prevents it from being too sweet, but it does resemble bakers chocolate as it finishes. Super complex and very malty, but the coffee and chocolate bring in fruity notes, roastiness and a slight herbal tart pucker..  1,358 characters	4.52
5325	Caffè Americano	Lifted this 22 oz. bottle from a beer museum in River Falls, WI, & I’m sure it has no idea how it got there. Split with my wife.. Black. Nose much milder than expected, a bit of roast & sweetness, little else.. Caffe’ Americano is a boozy punch to the forebrain. More balanced than most CC stouts, this has equal portions of vanilla, roast, espresso, sweetness, all with a sturdy shot of alcohol & a finish of light chocolate. Big, brawny. No problem at all to put away half of this bottle..  661 characters	3.88
5326	Caffè Americano	"Growler into pint glass. Pours a dark dark brown with a minimal darak tan head. Initial impression is expresso, chocolate, booze, vanilla, maybe a touch of molasses, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; carbonation is minimal. Finish is oily-smooth and yet conveys a warning note of the substantial ABV.
Cigar City makes some good stuff. Their stouts have, in my experience, been consistently excellent. Here's another one."	4.38
5327	Caffè Americano	Excited to have this one after hearing about it for so long, and it did not disappoint. Foreboding opaque black with a thin oatmeal colored head. Smell hits all the right notes: espresso, huge chocolate, vanilla, barley and smooth malt. The tastes is dark and powerfully creamy, the chocolate is heavy, the espresso lifts with the vanilla, there is some nuts and caramel under the surface, and the malts don't come across as super roasted, rather they are smooth and super heavy. This beer sits in the gut like a brick, but the body is creamy, somewhat airy, and frothy	4.5
5328	Caffè Americano	Poured a black body with one-finger head khaki head with minor lace. Mild espresso aroma of roasted coffee with some hints of lactic quality. Smooth, thick, heavy, easy to drink, well-hidden ABV, slightly cocoa sweet and roasted (and slightly sticky) coffee taste and so easy to drink. Well-balanced beer that is a must-try.	4.2
5329	Caffè Americano	Pretty much exactly as advertised: a big coffee stout with complementary notes of chocolate and vanilla. Thick and viscous in the glass, has that coffee ice cream aroma shared by manny of the best new-age coffee stouts. Flavors pack a big punch of espresso and fudge. The thick, velvety, luxurious mouthfeel is definitely the high point for me. Reminds me of the mouthfeel on Trillium's pastry stouts when they are successfully executed.	4.29
5330	Caffè Americano	"A-Pours a dark color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has coffee hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a generous coffee flavor
M-A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
O-A good Stout"	4.4
5331	Caffè Americano	Amazing beer. Poured into big brandy snifter. Foamy brown head, dissipates into a tan lacing. Big notes of coffee and vanilla and roasty malt on the nose. Taste is big sweetness of vanilla and chocolate followed by strong espresso and bold roast malt. Medium body, mouth watering, slight oiliness, alcohol buzz. Damn! This is tasty.	4.56
5332	Caffè Americano	22oz bottle, no apparent freshness date. 3,000th beer! Very dark brown body capped with a foamy brown head. Coffee, vanilla, and chocolate aroma with some roast and earthy hops in the background; booze is present. Intense flavors dance on the palate: cocoa, coffee, vanilla, caramel, roasted, peppery booze, earthy hops. Thick and creamy body, lower carbonation, alcohol is warming. Perfect beer for a milestone! This was fantastic!	4.5
5333	Caffè Americano	L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a coal black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of creamy, tan-colored, somewhat long-lasting head. Average lacing.. S: An incredibly enticing aroma of coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.. T: Tasted of a good amount of roasted malt (present throughout), a tinge of caramel, a ton of espresso (the dominant ingredient), a hint of vanilla, and a lot of dark chocolate. An extremely rich, complex, and powerful flavor. The coffee's definitely the star here, but it's ably supported by the chocolate, et. al. Quite delicious..  774 characters	4.49
5334	Caffè Americano	A: Pours a shiny jet black with a smattering of dark brown head. Mediocre retention and no lacing.. S: Dark roast, fresh dark roast coffee grounds, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, mild dark molasses, and a hint of anise and ethanol.. T: Vanilla is more prominent, along with espresso, hot chocolate, light roast, and alcohol. Long finish..  520 characters	4.28
5335	Caffè Americano	Pours dark - basically black. Mild aroma. Tastes of coffee and chocolate. More bitter than sweet and tastes a lot like drinking a cup of coffee with alcohol.	4.25
5336	Caffè Americano	"L Pours a dark brown approaching black
S Did not notice aroma
T Rich and chocolate tasting
F Extremely smooth
O This is a very nice beer. That being said I prefer Marshall Zhukov"	3.97
5337	Caffè Americano	"As liqueur like as it gets, big, deep, memorable. wins on depth and feel. Fun to taste off others in this case at Rattle N Hum vs Delireum and Framinghammer.
a) Ink well.
s) A bit too sweet and faint and much more caramel, chocolate and cream - than coffee.
t) But it blossoms in the mouth: vanilla, caramel, milk and dark roast, kaluha, walnut, chocolate and a whole shelf full of mixed chocolate bon bons.
f) Lands on the tongue with silken feel, velvet weighted, satisfying, think but not cloying.
o) Have to laugh at how viscous. But in the end sweetness with a low aroma puts in behind best RIS."	4.29
5338	Caffè Americano	Poured from the bottle into a large snifter glass.. Deep dark mocha head, with barely a finger created of fine foam, left to a large bubbled collar while settling and no puck Whispy top, and a classic dark walnut brown body.. Excellent stout aroma. Hints a bit boozy forward, with touches of almost brandy like heat. Wonderful milky and rich vanilla coffee aromas come right off. Silky smelling and velvety sensing, touches quite a bit of thick fudge like chocolate tones as well..  1,055 characters	4.25
5339	Caffè Americano	"**
03/21/19. Bottle to goblet.. LOOK: really beautiful. thick motor oil dark black, roiling brown and tan head.
AROMA: Roasted malt, fudge, coffee is 3rd, but still noticeable.
TASTE: Fudgy chocolate. Touch of roasty/coffee bitterness mixes nice with sweet cocoa/fudge.
FEEL: Full Full Body. Chewy. Thick..  355 characters"	4.28
5340	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	L: Very frothy. Amber. Clear.. S: You can smell it from across the room.. T: Big hop flavor that doesn't pull any punches. Swiming in hops, may take your palate a moment to adjust. It makes Lake Erie Monster look like Lake Erie Gecko. This beer will slap your ass and call you Sally..  602 characters	3.85
5341	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Traditional Big West Coast IPA out of Ohio. Balanced with tropical aromas, the bitterness is evident but not overwhelming. Dank, citrus, piney resin. Only complaint is the alcohol is quite noticeable. Check it out given the opportunity.	4.5
5342	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	12oz can into a pint glass, courtesy of friend Greg. Canned 6/21/19, so 2 months old.. Bright golden yellow body, faintly hazy, decent white head which dissipates to a solid covering leaving good lacing.. Delightful aroma Pine and citrus notes fighting it out on the nose, with pine coming out just ahead..  645 characters	4.35
5343	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	I’ve sought this for awhile, really excited to finally try it. Gorgeous orange color with a light tan head, this is not hazy at all. Dank citrus notes dominate the nose, and there’s also a healthy pine note.. The taste has a nice boozy note up front. I don’t normally appreciate booze, but this works magnificently with the dank citrus notes and pine notes.. There’s a reason this is a world-class beer. Truly phenomenal, and well worth the wait.	4.5
5344	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	12oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a small, off-white head of foam. It smelled of pine, citrus and caramel. Big piney bitterness with roasted caramel malt and sweet citrus.	4.39
5345	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	"Finally had a chance to try this iconic beer. As is the nature of things this beer is a huge credit to history and the early expansion of huge bitter west coast style DIPAs. Somewhat reminiscent of a Pliny, etc. Clearly remains an outstanding beer but now the bitterness and dank quality seem overstated. The creamy deep maltiness has a slight bit of a cloying and syrup. 10 years ago I would have marveled... now it seems somewhat pushy even a bit harsh in the aftertaste.
Can’t give a negative review but I guess for me I’ve just moved on. Have had enough huge pine and resin brews.... regardless of any citrus or malt contribution. Glad to have finally tried it."	4.25
5346	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Copper colored with a very clear complexion. Moderate, soapy lacing is present. There’s a three quarter inch creamy brown head. There’s a pungent citrus aroma. I’m tasting a massively bitter tangerine and citrus forward double IPA. The mouth is resinous, dry, and crisp.	4.29
5347	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Bottled 2/6/15; drank 3/13/15 @ the Yarchives.. Hazy dark orange appearance.. Big eggshell head; a curtain of tree-rung lace..  331 characters	3.81
5348	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Poured on draft at the Fat Head's Saloon.. Very floral and juicy. Tropical. A West coast style hop bomb.. Bitter enough to let you know you're drinking a hoppy fuckin beer, but balanced and extremely flavorful.	4.53
5349	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Hoppy, piney extremely aromatic. Pours a rich, clear gold with a moderate white head. Great mouthfeel, significant bitterness. Even finish and excellent overall	4.74
5350	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	4 pack Whole Foods in Cleveland. Pours a clear orange/light copper colour with limited off white head. Aroma dank piney, citrus, slightly floral, creeping into sweaty, but deliciously so. Taste starts sweet for a millisecond before the pine bitterness slaps you with a sticky resinous blast on the back of just a touch of caramel malt. Finishes slightly sticky with palate coating bitterness that warns against consuming anything else for a while, yet not a punishing bitter, a wondrously tasty one! Absolutely great.	4.49
5351	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Poured into a snifter.. 4.0 A: Clear light orange color. One finger of frothy white head that fades slowly into a short ring of lacing.. 4.25 S: Delicious! Pretty much all hops with pine, floral, and citrus all up in your face. Grassy and spicy underneath. The citrus is mango forward with lemon trailing..  845 characters	4.14
5352	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	L: Pours hazy golden with an inch of head that settles nicely. S: Strong citrus notes and piney. You can tell it's a strong IPA.. T: Very hoppy and very piney. Pineapple hints come out stronger the more you drink and pretty bitter. Can still taste the alcohol but not as much as I expected for having such a high ABV. Very good and refreshing..  632 characters	4.48
5353	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	This is up there with the best ones in my opinion. Really juicy...nice and citrusy hoppy. Just got this on tap from a brewpub while visiting my Dad and home town. I hope I can find this again up in my neck of the woods.	4.75
5354	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy golden color. There was a small off white head that leaves some lacing. Good hop nose. Mainly resinousy pine hops. Some tropical and citrus notes also. The taste is also very good. Resinous piney hops, along with some citrus and tropical flavors. Fairly bitter with no residual sweetness. Nice!	4.24
5355	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	I received a bottle of Hop Juju in a ninja box from the Newbies! I've been looking for this one for a while, so my heart skipped around a bit when I opened the box. I always love trying new IPAs - but ones that are so highly rated, and for so long... well now.. Hop Juju has some curious esters to it - a bit of banana, perhaps? It's quite hoppy, but I can't exactly nail down the style. The consistency and syrupy-ness tend to make me think this is a bit more in step with West Coast style IPAs, but it's very difficult to categorize. It has a sweetness, but likewise a bitterness. It's very palatable and nicely balanced.. This was worth a hunt, and a wait. It's quite good.	4.4
5356	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	"Good color and nice head rentention. For a higher ABV I don't necessarily taste the alcohol but a nice smooth beer with definite hop finish with a bit of spice.. 3/24/2018
5/"	4.32
5357	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Look- Pours clear golden orange with 2 finger fluffy white head that settles slowly. Smell- pineapple, grapefruit, orange, weed. Taste- follows nose with intense grapefruit and orange up front, then pineapple and weed with decent bitterness.  359 characters	4.33
5358	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	on draft, served in a 10 oz wide topped glass. clear, dark golden orange in color, foamy white head. pleasant hoppy aroma of citrus and pine. taste is fairly bitter, hop flavors are there with mild malt balanced - a touch boozy. thinner bodied, sticky mouthfeel.	3.99
5359	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	"Brilliant copper amber body, clear with some haze from the chill. Three finger white, creamy head with some serious staying power. Nice sticky, web-like lace.
Fresh pine and compost in the aroma mingles with tropical fruit, which comes more alive as it warms. The malts are wonderfully bready with a touch of honey.
The taste is complex yet balanced. Tropical fruit juices, pineapple, mangos and papaya. Citrus rind and herbal hops towards the middle with a wonderful piney spice at the end. A touch grainy but mostly bready malts. Hints of honey sweetness throughout.
Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Resin like mouth feel but not too heavy. Lovely dry finish with a bite from the alcohol.. Perfect balance between the malt and the hops. Hop profile very balanced for such an aggressive beer."	4.63
5360	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Bright copper orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, creamy, white foam that reduced to soapy cap with medium low retention. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Boozy warmth intensifies through the middle and turned a little prickly toward the finish. Medium spicy hop aromas with light citrus notes and an underlying dankness. Medium malt and caramel aromas with and sweet, boozy notes toward the end. Medium high spicy and citrus hop flavors up front with caramel maltiness. Medium high, spicy and pine bitterness through the middle. Herbal and spicy hop flavors with expanding booziness and caramel malt notes from the middle to the end. Finished semi-dryly with lingering pine hop bitterness and sweet caramel malt notes. Well balances intense hop and malt character. Hop aromas and flavors are solid and bitterness is intense but not overwhelming. A NE IPA this is not. A great old school west coast IPA, intense, hoppy and tasty.	4.37
5361	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	"This beer has a thin off white head to a beautifully clear golden clear beer.
It smells of honey dankness.
Tastes follows the nose pretty well. Almost a honey like sweetness with slight dank earthy qualities. Some pine.
Feeling is wet, thick and sticky. Coats the mouth well.
Overall, I can see how hopslam and this get related. This held up to expectations"	4.35
5362	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	12oz bottled 2/12/18 (19 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 9% ABV 100 IBU. The beer pours bright golden amber with sticky off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is tropical fruit, citrus and earth. The taste is earthy, with tropical highlights and citrus rind. No trace of 9% ABV in the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. To have this much feel and taste without ever going sweet or sticky is masterful. Overall, excellent. Recommended!	4.54
5363	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	Appearance - Pour crystal clear amber color with huge fluffy white head that will not go away. Lots of spotty lacing around the glass.. Aroma - huge orange and grapefruit with a hint of sweet tangerine. Nice hop resin mixed with citrus peel. No sign of the 9%.. Taste - Wow taste is big orange, tangerine and grapefruit with bitter citrus peel and hops. The alcohol comes out a little more than in the nose but does not hurt it..  644 characters	4.49
5364	Hop JuJu Imperial IPA	This beer is nearly perfect. Excellent IPA. It has a very smooth almost gentle finish compared to some other IPAs. Golden Amber in color. It has a great head on the pour. Quite excellent	4.79
5365	Second Fiddle	Light copper colored and hazy in complexion. There’s a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and covering a third of the top. Moderate lacing. The aroma is of earthy hops. I’m tasting earthy to vegetal hops. The mouth is smooth, easygoing, and crisp.	4.04
5366	Second Fiddle	This is becoming more readily available in restaurants. I have had this on draft and never been disappointed! Excellent aroma and taste, one of my go to's when available.	4.82
5367	Second Fiddle	After a quick stop at The Alchemist yesterday (07SEP19) for a few cans I stopped into The Reservoir in Waterbury for some libations. Started off with an 11oz pour of this, for $6.50.. Served in a small snifter, it was medium golden, had a smidge of haze, and scattered carbo. Head was a fine, thin layer of white foam, mostly at the rim. Lacing was quite nice, all over. Nose was a mix of breakfast jams - orange and apricot, with some rindy action. Body was medium to medium-plus, with a solid feel.. Flavor had a touch of crackery malt and light sweetness. Had more of the aroma jams - apricot, orange, tangerine. Was a little bit pithy and bitter in the finish. A solid, tasty DIPA. Prosit!.  805 characters	4.25
5368	Second Fiddle	From the can, it pours a lovely clear golden amber with a nice white head that eventually diminishes to a thin layer. In the nose, it is a mad forlorn hope of citrus and some pine in the assault! In the mouth, it is the same: grapefruit and citrus, along with a bit of bitter and malt. Yum!	4.51
5369	Second Fiddle	It's getting harder to rate IPAs these days because good IPAs are getting more plentiful and easier to find. The taste profiles are also catching up to the point where it's difficult to distinguish the better ones. To me, a few IPAs stand out and this stands up well against Heady Topper or Lawson's Sip of Sunshine.. It has a very pronounced orange taste ... one that comes on stronger when it kicks in. There is a bit of pine flavor/resin which is not as pronounced as in Lawson's or Heady Topper. It's a smooth drinking beer for sure. There is a slight bitterness to it balanced out by the citrusy juice. While I wouldn't necessarily call this a juicy IPA, it seems to blend the best qualities of East and West coast IPAs into one incredibly tasty beer.. I had it with lunch at The Chatham Bars Inn poured cold from a can into a pint glass. I was a bit surprised at seeing it there of all places and paid twelve bucks for the pleasure of tasting it. Now that I have, I will be on the lookout. This is better than anything Treehouse makes in my opinion and I could fill a fridge with it and not get sick of it.	4.79
5370	Second Fiddle	The aroma explodes of juicy mangoes, peaches, oranges. Just sweet nectar and fruity.. The flavor follows with sweet orange and grapefruit throughout. Almost towards fruit syrup. A medium sweetness in the middle, with some resinous and grapefruit on the finish. More herbal, pine, resin, tea, on the finish.. A beer that is dangerously drinkable and addictive, despite its reasonable amount of malt. Impressively clean. Very much a West Coast style, though one of the best in that style.	4.38
5371	Second Fiddle	Big juicy crusher. Floral, citrus, dank, earthy, bready, wine grapes, really nice carb, smooth, light and easy drinking at 8.2%. Great beer, stacks up well with it’s better known neighbors.	4.5
5372	Second Fiddle	Canned 4/29. Light gold, slightly hazy. Smells juicy, some hops. Taste is juicy, hoppy, citrus, pineapple, peach. Medium mouthfeel with a dry, puckering finish. Slight bitterness. Almost perfectly balanced and totally crushable. I gotta get me some more of this stuff.	4.59
5373	Second Fiddle	Unlike the Fiddlehead IPA, which tastes more unique, Second Fiddle hits all the typical NEDIPA notes for taste. That doesn’t mean it isn’t delicious. Not a hazy look or heavy feel. Get some.	4.32
5374	Second Fiddle	Canned on 3/6/19. Pours a clear, faintly copperish kind of gold with an ample, slightly rocky white head; very nice retention that results in plenty of persistent lacing and a frothy, albeit bubbly collar.. Aromas of dank peach, grapefruit, and tropical pith comes through strongly, with lighter notes of orange zest, pine, and bits of hoppy spice following; a restrained dankness comes through in spots, while a clear crisp malt backbone that dives into deeper notes of fresh rising dough and black bread crusts starts to shine on the finish..  1,502 characters	4.07
5375	Second Fiddle	This is an excellent DIPA. The initial sip hits the pallet with incredible balance and finishes with the bitter hoppy taste. Each sip thereafter finishes better and better. If you can find it, buy it, and enjoy it.	4.53
5376	Second Fiddle	"A really good IPA
dark orange in complexion, cloudy
Great aroma of hops, citrus & malt
Crisp, clean. What an American IPA should taste like
A tremendous balance of flavor & bitterness with a nice lingering finish"	4.45
5377	Second Fiddle	Now this is an oldschool IPA - and one that I haven't previously reviewed. I was mightily psyched for this check-in.. Second Fiddle is lightly dry and just a bit bitter and piney. It's not your typical New England hazy IPA, and that's totally okay! The balance of sweet, dry, clean, bitter, piney notes is quite pleasant. The ABV is very well disguised. Taste and texture are good - just a bit of syrup to it, but quite drinkable. It's a nice hybrid of oldschool IPA, with some west coast character, and a bit of that hoppy, sweet, NE IPA character.. Well done.	4.27
5378	Second Fiddle	Very good VT style IPA - similar to Heady Topper and Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine. Pours golden orage with tastes of grapefruit, pine, and other citrus fruit. Good bitterness in the finish.	4.31
5379	Second Fiddle	16 oz can, dated 1/31/19 so about 3 weeks old. Light yellow in color, slightly hazy, white head. Nice hop aroma, a mix of fruity, dank, grassy. Similar flavor, medium bitterness. Thin to medium bodied.	4.05
5380	Second Fiddle	Modest finger deep head, just off-white, even surface, few dimples, retention is good for what’s there initially, lacing starts out as wide sheets eventually breaking into thinner streaks. Soft gauziness to the liquid but nowhere near filmy or cloudy, bright golden color, noticeably dispersed tiny bubbles, like gentle snowflakes just, err, going up. Honeyed nose, tangerine to pink grapefruit and lime, citrus a major component, fresh unbaked pie crust, pine sap, coal tar, starts heading in a dank direction and suddenly stops, this allows the pineapple, apricot, green melon scents to spread some, not fully tropical in nature. Full-bodied, dry mouth entry, almost scrubbing in feel, the carbonation active with more prickle than creaminess. The breadiness more toasty and here the tarriness sinks in deeper. White pepper and a light salinity take the sappy goodness out of the pine notes. Somehow the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus gets pushed back to past the mid-palate, the carbonation churns it away. Papaya, pineapple, green apple to nectarine fruit, here it’s just the dryness which has it come off as not that tropical. Overall, there’s a lot going on and it never loses your attention. That said, could wish for more smooth integration.	4.04
5381	Second Fiddle	Was given one by a friend. Loved it. Another friend had one of my all time favorites Sip of Sunshine with him. This was every bit as enjoyable. Both same price. I can’t favor one over the other. They are 2 of my top 3 NEIPA. The other being Focal Banger. Heady Toppers little brother. HT is number 4 for me. I live in Central VT and have easy access to all of them. Second Fiddle will be my go to beer of choice because it’s new to me	4.77
5382	Second Fiddle	Picked-up a four-pack @ Portside Liquors in Plymouth, MA for about seventeen dollars. My second brew from these guys, who I think are new to MA. Solid, if unspectacular brew.	4.25
5383	Second Fiddle	Look is an opaque honey orange and poured with 2 fingers of fluffy white head.. Aroma is mainly grapefruit and big pine.. Taste is grapefruit, sticky pine, some tangerine and maybe some melon lurking in the shadows. Has a nice bitter bite at the end..  409 characters	4.46
5384	Second Fiddle	"I'm told this outstanding DIPA from Fiddlehead Brewing in Shelburne, VT is very tough to get outside the Burlington area. In that regard--and in others--it compares well with the legendary Heady Topper. Big, three fingered head, incredible nose loaded with citrus and pine and dangerously drinkable at 8.2%, this is an outstanding example of the now-revered NEIPA style. (It also helps to explain why that style is now-revered and wildly popular.)
On the front end, the beer has a pleasant bready character; in the middle, the citrus fruit (tangerine, orange) makes its presence known, along with some pear and pine notes. The back end has a most interesting bitter, resiny, almost wood-like finish that includes hint of more citrus, especially lemon. What was most surprising was how crisp it was. I'm guessing that, like Heady Topper, you want to drink this fresh .
The layers of flavor in this exceptional beer might cause a NEIPA lover to ask, ""Heady Who?"" (although that NEIPA lover might rightly be considered deranged). Bottom line here is that you'd be a fool to diss HT, and just as much a fool to miss Second Fiddle. Big Props to Fiddlehead Brewing..."	4.71
5385	Second Fiddle	From a 16oz can from 9/18. Big thick, soapy head that lasts forever on top of a predominately clear orange gold beer.. It smells and tastes really juicy with a ton of tangerine and some melon along with piney, bitter, resinous hops. It’s actually pretty bitter overall so the strong juicy flavor gives it a nice balance. It is a little bit toward the boozy and hefty end of the spectrum, but not heavy or syrupy in any way..  559 characters	4.27
5386	Second Fiddle	16 oz beer poured into a nonic pint glass canned on the 9/18.. A: Small tight white head that dissipates to a film. Body has good clarity with a deep gold amber color.. S: Lots of resiny hops but some slight sweet hints if grapefruit and pineapple..  607 characters	3.98
5387	Second Fiddle	Six weeks from canning... Orange haze, perfectly uniform throughout, nice lacing. Smells like melons, taste is a little more piney/dank than expected, but it works nice. Good feel, nice brew	4.52
5388	Second Fiddle	A: Pours a lightly hazy orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing. S: Lots of citrus and tropical fruit up front along with a touch of floral and grassy hops. Light bready maltiness. T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and tropical fruit notes. Moderately bitter. Picks up some light floral notes as well as some bready malt. Finishes with lingering citrus rind.  574 characters	4.48
5389	Second Fiddle	Almost clear golden color with off-white head. Aroma has resiny, piney hops with a sweet malt background. Taste starts bitter upfront, slightly astringent, quite harsh and resiny. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. I expected much more from this one considering the hype but it's a quite basic DIPA with intense bitterness and not much complexity.	3.75
5390	Fort Point Pale Ale	"One of the beers that started it all for me. Not quite as tropical as you’d think but still juicy.
Hazy by no too heavy. Good beer! I could drink a few of these."	4.25
5391	Fort Point Pale Ale	Finally got to the brewery when they had this! 16 oz. can dated 8/27/19, poured into Aslin glass.. L: Hazy golden with just a hint of orange. 1.5F soapy head with scant lacing and a ring.. S: Peach-orange with just a hint of earth and pine. Nice and clean..  828 characters	4.63
5392	Fort Point Pale Ale	A. Super hazy, fluffy looking orange color with some darker caramel notes. 2 finger fizzy white head that fades quick. S: mango, guava, melon, passionfruit fruit, pineapple, caramel, sweet dough, biscuits, candied apricots. A touch of sweet lemons citrus as well. T: guava, melon, apricot, and some green hop burn upfront. Grapefruit, sweet malts, clementines, and cantaloupe behind that. A touch of floral hops in here as well with a hint of residual earthy bitterness.  788 characters	4.08
5393	Fort Point Pale Ale	Swung by Trillium on the way through Boston. Grabbed a 4 pack of these along with some other goodies. Can dated 6/5/19 and poured into a tulip glass.. L: Deep wheat/orange with a good 2 inches of froth that sticks around for a little bit but quickly fades.. S: Deep mango richness - tropical bubble gum and some citrus zest. Quite aromatic - you can smell the beer after you pour. Almost a bit of peach..  1,058 characters	4.04
5394	Fort Point Pale Ale	Served in a pint from the can.. Appearance: Cloudy yellow orange color with medium bubbles. Off white head rising maybe a nudge over a finger's length.. Smell: light lemon skin scent..  390 characters	4.12
5395	Fort Point Pale Ale	"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/24/17 with ""HOW ABOUT NO"" written below that. It's easy to see how this would be Trillium's flagship offering as this was quite heavy, dank, and tasty at the same time, while being a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Even though this can was two years old, it aged well and had very little sediment in it, as the flavors held up quite well over time!. This had a nice pour to it as the liquid was a quietly radiant apricot with a fair head topping it off. A thin ring of lacing was left around the top of my pint glass as the faint collar was the best residue that I could find. A few soapy sections remained as I worked my way through this but it was disappointing for something that was quite enjoyable. Lots of bright stone fruit, peach, wheat, and white grape could be found in the varied nose as the taste had quite a range of flavors to it as well. Light wood, citrus pith, and a subtle earthiness could be found on the palate as this warmed up as I enjoyed the nuances of this beer. Moderately slick and lightly carbonated, this felt like Hawaiian Punch in the aftertaste as the tropical and juicy notes lingered on my tongue once the liquid fully went down.... Not a lot of booze to this as this truly was an American Pale Ale and not an IPA that went by another name. Balanced in body, there was little sediment in the liquid or at the bottom of my pint glass once I finished this off. Certainly enjoyable, this wasn't a standout beer but had enough going for it that the hype wasn't entirely unjustified. Fans of Trillium would be wise to see this out although it's certainly not a hop bomb or full of dankness. Instead, this was a beer that anyone could easily embrace, since there was enough to like about it from the get-go!"	4.25
5396	Fort Point Pale Ale	"This is a very good beer. A few years ago, I would have said ""Amazing."" With what we're finding at other breweries, I'd buy it if I were local, but wouldn't go out of my way."	4.38
5397	Fort Point Pale Ale	16oz can - Double Dry Hopped version. Pours a small finger of white head into my willi becher glass, a little soapy looking, dissipates quickly. Good initial lacing. Body looks like orange juice. Meh, looks ok I guess.. Nose is pretty juicy, loaded with grapefruit, some mango. Dank, piney hops linger underneath the fruit. Small amount of creamy wheat present as well. Pretty nice job of staying balanced between traditional hop aromas, and fruit. Not an “American pale ale” by any means, as their website says, regardless, smells pretty good..  1,759 characters	3.73
5398	Fort Point Pale Ale	"A-Hazy pineapple juice look with a nice head that dissipates quickly
S-Big tropical punch of sweet fruit aroma with a slight sweet malt background
M-Thick and pillowy but also quite peppery and effervescent
T-Sweet deception with a smooth and lasting bitterness
O-Really great beer. The peppery flavour was a little harsh on the senses."	5
5399	Fort Point Pale Ale	Pours a murky orange that glows like a Dragonball when held up to the light. Snow-white foam tops out at just over a finger after a modest pour, and retains well. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and pineapple form a smashing, but not brutal or harsh, tropical fruit display. It smells a little sweet. Toasty biscuit, wheat, and bread malt notes help bring down the sugary citrus rush. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, orange, and mango with a hit of toasty biscuit, and bready malt notes. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy, nearing-on-velvety texture at the onset and then thins out on the tongue. It has a middle of the road consistency. Overall, a flavorful American Pale Ale, although it really drinks like any other NE IPA just with a little more malt at the forefront. Knocked down 1/4 of a point for that. The malt balance here helps counteract the sugary hop pull most NE IPAs carry, landing this one at a very favorable balance.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can.	4.38
5400	Fort Point Pale Ale	From the 16 oz. can which was canned 09/13/18. Sampled on September 27, 2018.. Murky, milky looking light amber-yellow in color with a lingering and modest white foamy head. Some lacing.. The aroma emits vibrant characters of grapefruit juice, pineapple, citrus, and tropical fruits. There is a mellower toasted pale malt barley grain presence..  519 characters	4.31
5401	Fort Point Pale Ale	Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass, sure why not. Canned July 24th 2018.. Quit a good soapy three finger bubbly head that dissolves and pops with quite a bit of gusto. Opaque dark lemon yellow to hinting orange body color, not quite full turbid character but also with a nice glow.. Very nice aromatic nose. Light malts with a touch of crispy brown sugar, mixing with a very noticeable tropical hop angle of mostly pineapple. Soft possible sensing body, with an excellent sugary quality that isn't overbearing. Quite nice..  1,033 characters	4.05
5402	Fort Point Pale Ale	Pours a hazy peach coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is initially quite lovely, with hoppy, juicy tropical/citrus fruit notes of mango and passion fruit with a hint of pineapple and tangerine, but takes on a light cat piss note as it sits. Taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. There's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. Finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.. This is the quintessential NE style Pale Ale and I would say that it has an amazing juicy hoppiness, mouthfeel and depth of flavour for a Pale Ale, BUT is this even a Pale Ale at 6.6% ABV? Nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer at a relatively low ABV. The balance of sweet tropical fruit, zesty citrus fruit and dankness/pine really is outstanding here.	4.38
5403	Fort Point Pale Ale	"The first thing I said when I tasted this beer was ""pineappley goodness"", and I'll stick to that. The overwhelming flavor of this beer is certainly what you notice, but behind that, it's actually pretty balanced. I thought it was a bit less hazy than most of the recent ""New England-style"" beers, but I get why this is their main APA, and I'd bet it is one of their two or three biggest sellers too."	4
5404	Fort Point Pale Ale	Dated 5/9/18 on the bottom of the can, 12 days since brewing.. Pours a nearly opaque straw-gold with a finger and a half of compact white head. Aromas bursting out of the can as soon as I cracked it open. First notes of the nose are of spices; pepper, coriander and cumin. This is followed by ruby grapefruit pith, black licorice, honeydew and a selection of over-ripened tropicals (mango, apricot, pineapple). Taste follows the nose with the over-ripened fruit and spices, but also brings in some dankness, pine resin and pale grainy malt. Body is a smooth medium- with low dryness and a medium- hoppy bitterness. Another great IPA from Trillium, perfectly balanced and smooth, Great blend of hops that give mix of pungent spices, tropical fruit and hoppiness.	4.48
5405	Fort Point Pale Ale	CANNED ON 05/09/18. Pours an opaque peachy haze topped with a pillowy layer of white foam. Fragrant tropical hop saturated nose...mango and apricot slices, grapefruit, pine needles, and a faint leafy herbal spice. Heavy Citra hop flavors - bold and fruity leaving lingering oily resins on the tongue. Peach, mango, zesty citrus, pine sap, and a general fresh hop earthy greenness. Smooth and frothy, fairly heavy for an APA, but stays drinkable thanks to a super crisp finish. Good stuff...essentially an IPA.	4.34
5406	Fort Point Pale Ale	Had a few of these on draft the other day at The Tinker's Son in Norwell for eight dollars a pop! I prefer this to Congress Street, less of the mango taste. Would buy if I saw in cans, but not for $8/.	4.5
5407	Fort Point Pale Ale	L - Hazy orange with murky body and two fingers of white head. S - Orange juice and bitter hop juice explosion. Some pine, lemon zest, and grapefruit too. T - Also an eruption of oj, bitterness, mango, grapefruit..  293 characters	4.64
5408	Fort Point Pale Ale	Canned on 12/20/17, 14:31.. Pours a really nice hazy orange color. Some sticky lace and a small white head of foam.. Tropical and malt nose, with lingering hoppy bitterness. Hints of peach, an overall very refreshing scent, with some grassiness as it warms..  458 characters	4.39
5409	Fort Point Pale Ale	"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 10/18/17.
A: Pours a hazy, gold-orange color with a white head, some retention, and moderate lacing.
S: Aromas of mango, lemon, and peach complete with a graininess.
T: Lemon is definitely the predominant fruit, with a biscuity backbone. Fruity, grainy, but semi dry, with well calibrated bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Leaves a tingling in the mouth.
O: Like the other Trillium offerings, flavor forward and at the edge of the style. Highly drinkable and enjoyable."	4.22
5410	Fort Point Pale Ale	The beer is a hazy, bright, yellow-gold coloring that is almost opaque, with a frothy, foamy, bright white head that sits low profile and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of citrus initially, with a grassy undertone that anchors the nose a bit. Flavors are a citrus blast on the forward tongue, followed by a subtle biscuit backbone that balances well. Lemon and tangerine dance across the palate with every sip, and there is a grassy and peppery blend to keep the sweetness in check. Smooth, mid-bodied, with light, almost effervescence into the aftertaste of citrus sweetness. Slick, clean, slightly dry finish that leaves some citrusy linger behind. Easy drinker but just okay for me. Review may have been influenced by drinking a Cutting Tiles DIPA prior to this.	3.75
5411	Fort Point Pale Ale	"Bought one at the brewery and had to check my luggage to get it and 10 various others home.
Outstanding.
I wish this was available where I live cause it would be a refrigerator beer
Curious why it's not considered an ipa. It certainly qualifies in the hop category..."	4.35
5412	Fort Point Pale Ale	Cloudy straw appearance with slight whit head. Mild hoppy aroma with a touch of citrus. Taste is definitely pleasant citrus first with a hint of hoppyness	4.52
5413	Fort Point Pale Ale	Very enjoyable DDH pale ale. Perfect balance but it definitely taste more like an IPA. Citrusy, grapefruit, and mango. Medium bitterness, yet very smooth.	4.29
5414	Fort Point Pale Ale	I've had the Enigma-hopped variant, but boy howdy, I surely prefer the original - beautiful, creamy head, wonderfully hazy and juicy. This exemplifies what I love about NE IPAs. I'd happily drink this for about 50% of the rest of my life. Then if I could have Abraxas or Vanilla Noir for the other 50%, life would be good.	5
5415	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	A 2014 bottle from the reserve collection at Jackie O’s production brewery served in a snifter.. Look- A dense black with a little less than a finger of dark mocha head. Surprised that there was virtually no lacing with this one.. Smell- Tons of vanilla, maple, and bourbon with a nutty aroma mixed in. The barrel doesn’t really dominate like I expected..  803 characters	4.6
5416	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Served in a snifter. Dark cola brown appearance. Slightly thinner in body than I anticipated. The liquid was capped by a small, bubbly, khaki colored colored crown that quickly dropped to a frothy collar. Tiny dots and streaks of lacing stuck along the glass.. The aroma was really malty and robust. Nice melding of caramel and roasted malts. Slightly sweet. A bit nutty. Bourbon notes came through big time. Super boozy but not excessively so. A subtle wet paper-like quality also detectable. Touch of smokiness too. Zero maple character however..  1,649 characters"	4.04
5417	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	"L: Dark dark brown with a half finger head that fades quickly
S: Caramel, vanilla, and oakey/roasty
T: Char and roast dominate with some caramel and/or maple notes
F- Decent weight
O: Jackie O's never disappoint - even the least of them."	4.4
5418	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	A 12.7 fl. oz. bottle, 2017 vintage, poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Black in colour with a thin mocha brown head that dissipated quickly and left only some sparse spotty lacing.. Aroma: Roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, bourbon, booze, molasses, licorice, with a hint of herbal and char..  649 characters	3.88
5419	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Well executed combination of maple and bourbon barrels... both are very prominently displayed without overpowering the other.. Maple is a more subtle/natural component, and not an overly-sweet/ artificial flavor.. Really easy to drink with medium body.	4.6
5420	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	"L -- Pours a very deep brown body with a scant half finger of pale brown head produced with aerated pour. Head recedes quickly, leaving a small ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lacing
S -- Smoke, maple, vanilla, caramel, bourbon, sugar-dusted dark fruits, dark chocolate
T -- Largely follows the nose. The maple is noticeable but doesn't overpower and instead integrates very nicely with the rest of the smokey, barrely, fudgy tastes going on here
F -- Big mouthfeel, minimal carb. Nice silkiness to it, much more than the other Jackie O's stouts I've had
O -- The major downfall here is the price, at $15/13oz bottle... Otherwise this stuff is fabulous. Just about as good as BA Oro Negro. 89/100"	4.42
5421	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	2018 vintage - Pours dark brown-black with a khaki tan foam head. Smells like maple toast, roasty nutty bready malts, graham crackery, slight coconut, dark fruits, hint of dried cherry, maple syrup, bourbon, oak, mild vanilla, caramel, chocolate, some coffee, light smokiness, with mild earthy hops. Tastes like dark cherry, dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, nutty roasted malts, coffee, toasted bread, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, oak barrel, mild smoke, hint of coconut, graham cracker, maple toast, with earthy hops to balance. Smooth thick medium body, moderate low carbonation. Really nice bourbon barrel aged imperial porter with maple syrup.	4.77
5422	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal, roast, char bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roast/hop bitter/sweet, and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1%, with minimal barrel booze lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BBA imperial porter! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Amazingly rich/well rounded malt complexity and maple syrup presence; with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy on barrels. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.	4.25
5423	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Similar to lots of their beer this imperial (porter?) stout shows some oak notes which make it kind of vinous. The bourbon is light and the maple absent. Lots of nuts notes. Quite drinkable despite the high abv	4.34
5424	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	"375ml bottle poured into large snifter
2016 vintage gifted to me by EZ. Pours medium to dark brown with almost no head to speak of. This really speaks to the light carbonation of this brew, because it doesn’t taste oxidized at all. Very light and smooth. Nose is bourbon heavy and brownie batter. Sweet chocolate and bourbon are present but take a back seat to roasted walnut/pecan. Maple doesn’t become present until the chill is broken and it warms a bit. The warmer this gets, the more the flavors pop off the charts. All the flavors meld together well. If I had to say that one thing shines in this beer it has to be the nuttiness, hands down. Fantastic brew!"	4.49
5425	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	2017.. Pours a deep black with a tiny caramel colored head, no lacing present.. Lots of sugary sweet maple syrup on the nose. Hints of the barrel (oak and bourbon), along with some caramel..  336 characters	4.41
5426	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Pours deep black with no head and minimal lacing.. Aroma is oak, bourbon but don’t get the maple I expected.. Taste is very solid and I do get maple in the aftertaste that lingers. I will say the alcohol is very well hidden..  563 characters	4.42
5427	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	"12.7 FL. OZ. bottle
Served in a Jackie O's snifter. This beer pours black and is topped with a skim of mocha head that leaves no lacing.. The smell is dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and alcohol..  490 characters"	4.51
5428	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple pours a very deep brown and sports a light brown head of foam. The head dissipates fairly quickly. The beer smells quite good - it's certainly sweet, per the nose, but also has a bit of booziness.. While cold, the beer has a slightly dry mouth feel. The barrel is definitely present. It is, per the smell, very sweet. The maple somehow fails to be all that present in the taste.. As the beer warms, it just gets sweeter. It has a nice bit of heat to it, but the alcohol isn't present in the taste..  777 characters	4.08
5429	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle into a Jackie O's tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. 2015 bottle.. Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a two finger brown head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of foam and little lacing.. Aromas are heavy on the bourbon, cocoa and light vanilla, dark- bittersweet chocolate, lightly roasty with coffee aromas. Not getting much maple on the aroma..  798 characters	4.1
5430	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	"From the shorty bottle from the brewery in a snifter. This beastly little brew pours a rich
opaque with a nice head of dark brown foam that settles to a thick ring , a thin pool,
and shows some nice light lacing. Nose of boozy bourbon, subtle vanilla, mild oak, light
char touched marshmallow, sweet dark maple, and rich malts. Flavors nail it out of the park
with rich toasted nutty malts dancing about maple and deep brown sugars that have become
drunken on boozy bourbon. Mild vanilla and more assertive oak give richness without being overly
cloying to a lightly char touched marshmallow and dark rich cocoa that has a subtle coffee note on
the back that has of course gotten drunk on bourbon as well. Fantastic mouth feel; full lightly slick
body, low carbonation, and a rich boozy finish laced with more flavor than there is characters on a
keyboard. Exceptional.. Cheers"	4.59
5431	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Fantastic aged stout from Jackie O’s - all of their aged stuff I’ve smtried is fantastic, a step above others. This one was kind of boozy in a good way, and the maple was present but not obnoxious.	4.27
5432	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	I'd been looking forward to this for quite a while and, although there were some unexpected things about it, it didn't disappoint. Poured from a 12.7 ounce 2017 bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. Very dark brown color (would've said black but near the end you can see it's brown) with a small beige head. Smell has a very strong bourbon presence and a sweetness but not specifically maple. Ditto on the taste but with some vanilla and dark chocolate notes. Feel was pleasantly light; I'm wondering if this is why this is an American Porter but the Vanilla BBBM is an Imperial Stout; I've got one of those for future consumption so we'll see.	4.42
5433	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	2014 bottle poured into a snifter.. Pours pitch black with a dark mocha colored head that is less than a finger high. No lacing and the head vanishes almost immediately leaving a small ring of foam around the glass.. Aromas of sweet bourbon, vanilla, maple, and a nutty hazelnut type of smell..  715 characters	4.59
5434	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	An absolute GEM of a porter once she warms. Thought I wasn't getting any maple until she sat. Thin and extremely flavorful. Could sip on this forever. Slightest touch of abv.	4.55
5435	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	great beer, reminded me A LOT of KBS (in a good way) if there was maple to it. Its strong and a touch boozy but not overpoweringly so. Light carbonation, pours black, small khaki head, great nose of bourbon, maple, and chocolate.	4.24
5436	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	A fine BA stout but it's hot, thin, and there's very little maple to my taste. Less clear and distinct as KBS, nor as luxurious as BCBS. Not the biggest fan of the JO profile I guess.	4.08
5437	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Sweet maple and caramel aroma. Taste is a very pleasant maple bourbon with a little caramel with no alcohol bite at all	4.52
5438	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	375ml Bottle. This one come's my way courtesy of Dave! Thanks a million, guy!This beer is black. No shadows, no hints of anything, just black. The foam is a little hard to get going but it rose as I finished pouring. The head grew to a thin cap, shy of a finger in height, and was the color of milk chocolate. A thin ring remains with a tiny island traversing the surface. Thin drink lines are left after each drink. This beer looks and acts like an 11% porter.. Oh, man. The nose on this beer is decadent. A big ol' flash of pecans gets the ball rolling. Burnt sugar and molasses join he fray shortly thereafter. There's a moderate roast in the middle high cocoa content chocolate, rich yet bordering on bitter. I don't get a ton of maple but the barrel aging was deftly handled. The barrel aspects compliment, instead of overtake, by wrapping the base beer in an embrace of toasted marshmallow, damp oak, and rich caramel. I love the toasted marshmallow quaility when pulled from barrels..  2,255 characters	4.34
5439	Bourbon Barrel Black Maple	Pours a jet black with a light tan foam that disappears quickly. Nose is beautiful. Notes of caramel, vanilla and maple along with a strong bourbon presence. Taste of nice amount of barrel, charred oak, maple syrup, caramel, vanilla, a shot of bourbon and toasted malt. Lighter on the body than expected but still manages to be somewhat creamy in texture. Jackie O's knows how to barrel aged a excellent beer.	4.4
5440	Coolship Red	375 ml bottle, dated 11/15/18, poured into a flute. A- A slightly hazy bright ruby red with a small pink head.. S- Sour, raspberry jam, funky, oak, some tannins..  346 characters	4.59
5441	Coolship Red	Cracked at fridge temp and the gorgeous smell immediately escaped the bottle. Pours a beautiful reddish pink with very little head (despite an aggressive pour). Nose is dominated by raspberry. Also getting really nice notes of vanilla, funk, oak, and raisin. Taste is mouth puckering sour upfront. Wow! Tart, sour, raspberry, tree, oak, vanilla, yeast, and maybe a bit of sherry. The taste lingers on the aftertaste for quite some time. Such a gorgeous mouthfeel - somewhat dry. Overall, this is an outstanding beer. One of my favorites of this style from an American brewery.	4.6
5442	Coolship Red	7 ounce draft served in a juice glass, which doesn’t seem like the best choice.. Lots of raspberries, some funk, a decent amount of tart and sour. It’s good, but fairly straightforward and not as complex as other highly rated wild ales/sours. Was expecting this to be much better.	4.06
5443	Coolship Red	2019 vintage; drank 4/5/19 @ Yuss Haus Mach III.. I found this less subtle than the 'regular' Coolship, which was a revelation for me. Fruit forward & enjoyable, but a bit one-note.. The base beer is a delicate beauty, best enjoyed on it's own. This will do in a pinch though!	4
5444	Coolship Red	Not quite as tart as expected. Bottle says 6.2 ABV so perhaps the recipie changed. Definite oakiness, well defined raspberry with the mustiness of red wine. Not really the sour I’m looking for unfortunately.	4.23
5445	Coolship Red	"Been hunting this one for years. As Captain Ahab quipped, ""this is what ye have shipped for men! To chase that white whale on both sides of the land, over all sides of the earth!"" Beautiful ruby red pour that glowed in the sunlight, with no head after initial surface carbonation. Smell was the star: deep raspberry both fresh skins and sour insides, beautiful oak full of character, wheat, vanilla, wild flower, wild belgian yeast, apricot, and red wine barrel influences. Taste is way more subtle, but not really any less complex or beautiful, just wanted a little more bite like the belgian lambics do on the finish. Simultaneously vinous, sweet, tart, boozy and funky. Well worth the hunt, but does not compete with the belgian lambics of fame"	4.38
5446	Coolship Red	Would I buy this again? I would buy the full allotment! Literally cases if I could get away with it.. Easily one of the best beers Ive ever tasted.. Ive never smelled a better beer.	4.83
5447	Coolship Red	2018 release.. A: Pours a purplish-red with a cap of tight white head. Excellent retention.. S: Bright raspberry, mild earthy funk, light cherry, and light dry barrel..  484 characters	4.4
5448	Coolship Red	"L -- Pours a lovely hue of red with modest clarity and a half finger of rocky white head produced with moderate pour. Very minimal retention or lacing
S -- Raspberry jam, raspberry leaf, tart apple, oak, bretty funk, lemon, strawberry, sweet floral. Beautiful and clean -- on par with the clarity of aromas found in Peche n Brett (although obviously very different)
T -- Largely follows the nose. The raspberry character really balances out the lacto-forward tartness nicely: it's not acetic nor does it just taste like a fruited gose
F -- Medium- mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Flies off the palate quite quickly for the style, which makes it all the more refreshing
O -- This is a fabulous fruited lambic, and one of the best naturally inoculated beers I've had, period. Pricing is very high, but it's worth it
(cr). 91/100"	4.53
5449	Coolship Red	Definitely a solid offering, but frankly I had higher expectations. I much prefer other Allagash similar offerings like Bizou (only at the brewery) and Nancy. Either way, a solid beer.	4.2
5450	Coolship Red	Chill haze pale salmon-red with loud fizzy bubbles settling quickly to nothing but a slippery, lightly bubbling surface.. Smell comes across as oaky, acetic and vinegary, but also floral and fruity with tons of red raspberry.. Taste is quite sharply sour, very very potent of malic acidity, verging into acetic, but also full of bursting raspberry juice, as well as some toasty char and a little balsamic lemon glaze..  621 characters	3.88
5451	Coolship Red	"Look: Pink/red Clear with small white head that recedes immediately. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Tart, raspberries, cheese, cherry pits, and funk.
Taste: Very tart, raspberries, cheese, and funk.
Mouthfeel: Light with a dry finish.
Overall: A very good wild ale from Allagash."	4.61
5452	Coolship Red	This one pours a light pink-ish red, fully clear, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.. This smells absolutely incredible- jammy and seedy raspberry, both sour and just slightly sweet, with tannic red wine, oak, and a musty funk that's just delightful.. There's a lot to unpack with this beer. It's probably the best beer I've ever had from Allagash- and that's saying quite a lot, as they make awesome beer. The raspberry flavor is bold and beautiful, but miraculously doesn't dominate, as the base beer is slightly prickly, with a warm musty barnyard funk- earthy but inviting. There's some nice oak and red wine flavors as well. This is just so well rounded..  852 characters	4.79
5453	Coolship Red	In many ways this is the beer I’ve been journeying towards since diving into craft beer. A beer that, had I encountered it a few years ago, I would’ve undoubtedly enjoyed it but not to this level of depth.. This beer is unreal.. Sunset-red with an eggshell-white head that fades quickly. Raspberry personified..  775 characters	4.64
5454	Coolship Red	"Bottled Jan 19,2017. 6.2% abv
Look - fantastic auburn color no real head
Smell - tart raspberry booze
Taste - not as much raspberry as expected, kind of woody very tart
Feel - medium body with a tingly carb
Overall - pretty good but not worth the price"	4.17
5455	Coolship Red	"A: Light Ruby pour with little head retention.
S: Funky, Raspberries, Sour Cherries, andWatermelon.
T: Tart raspberries, funk, sour cherries.
MF: Thick raspberries tart blast. Thicker Lambic for sure.
O: nice sourness with great aromas and tartness."	4.25
5456	Coolship Red	Bottle: Poured a reddish color beer with a nice pink foamy head with limited retention and some light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with cherry notes and light oak presence. Taste is also dominated by tart notes with cherry and oak notes with some more dominant then expected acidity. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Enjoyable but maybe more acidic notes then I cared for.	3.73
5457	Coolship Red	Slightly hazy strawberry hue; fine, rappidly vanishing head, no lacing, appropriate per style; straw, cut grass, and root cellar funk with cherries, raspberries and stone fruit jams with pie crust in the nose; light and appropriate carbonation, pleasant added viscosity from residual sugar that leaves a slight tongue coating cloying sensation in the finish.. Overall: Mama's fresh cherry pie on the farm, taken in late summer over lunch in the cool shade of the barn, with the grassy aroma of a fresh hay cutting in the breeze.	4.57
5458	Coolship Red	Rate #3999!. Pours a beautiful strawberry red, with a small pink head that quickly dissipates. Lots of lively carbonation can be seen.. The aroma burst forth with raspberries, but there's a lot more going on here! Pie crust, must, cobwebs in an old basement, and bright, citric acidity. Freshly cut hay is there, but then gets overtaken by cherry and raspberry pie! I could get lost just smelling this beer! Delightful!.  1,099 characters	4.54
5459	Coolship Red	"2017 drank on 10/19/2017. L-light red, minimal head and lacing
S-funky and fruit and tart, nice oak too
T-follows the nose, very funky and fruity. F-medium tartness that lingers a little harsh. Funky and drinkable.  246 characters"	4.5
5460	Coolship Red	Absolutely fantastic. The body is a bold bright red, the nose funk and sweet raspberry, and flavors are firm berry tartness, strong oak, and almost sea salt. Coolship red is a true pleasure.	4.8
5461	Coolship Red	2015 vintage. Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a tulip.. Pours a maroon, cloudy body with a small pink head that reduces to leave a ring of retention.. Aromas are out of this world, heavy raspberry and tart lactic, funky and light oak. berries to the max! On the tongue it’s lightly tart and effervescent, dry raspberries and yeasty funk, maybe a bit of oak on the finish. Crisp easy drinker, light body. Finish is yeasty.	4.57
5462	Coolship Red	Too sour to find the nuances in this beer. Seems like a load of fruit but unable to really appreciate it because of the intense warhead-esqe pucker. Also, overly carbonated for my taste.	3.69
5463	Coolship Red	"Drank from a 12.7 fl oz (375 ml) corked and caged bottle
Date Bottled: Dec. 21, 2015
Served in a tulip
Huge thanks to my friend Bill for sharing this with me.. The hazy, light magenta body was capped by a finger tall, bubbly, bright white crown that slowly faded to a lasting ringlet. No lacing whatsoever.. Berry notes came through big time in the nose. Not sure if this was a cherry or a raspberry beer initially. Somewhat tart yet also sweet. Slightly medicinal perhaps. Soon, the fresh raspberry notes took over. Really pure, bright and fragrant. There was a slightly powdery and dry yeastiness. Bit of lemony tartness as well. Spectacular..  1,436 characters"	4.58
5464	Coolship Red	I love raspberries, so this review is a bit biased toward this beer. That being said, Red is my favorite Allagash product to date. From the moment I popped the cork, the raspberry aroma punched me in the nose & I knew it wouldn't let me down. Pours a nice red, perfect tartness & that raspberry flavor is just incredible.	4.95
5465	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	12.7 oz, 2019 bottling, served in a snifter.. Appearance: Completely black. thin tan head with some persistent small strands and islands of lacing.. Smell: Rich and sweet - chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, just a hint of walnut..  874 characters	4.66
5466	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	2016 bottle is drinking nice. Initially the cinnamon is most prevalent, but it gives way to lots of pepper and a thick, creamy body. No carb, but feel is on point. Definitely some heat from the pepper (not the barrel), not subtle.	4.59
5467	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	A 12.7 fl. oz. bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a snifter glass at Jackie O’s.. Look- a very dark brown that was almost black. A less than one finger head that disappeared quickly.. Smell- Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon up front. A little spice and cinnamon for extra aroma. I didn’t get any note tones..  654 characters	4.55
5468	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Description: Appearance is glassy and black with a small amount of dark, tan foam. Smell is deep and rich, with cinnamon and chilies dominating. Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon are also evident, providing for a complex aroma. The taste carries the same cinnamon and chilies, but they are extremely prevalent, to the point that the bourbon, chocolate and other underlying flavors are drowned out. It’s a hot, spicy and slightly bitter finish that doesn’t keep up with the richness of the smell. Feel is a little thin for a stout with low carbonation as can be expected.. Overall: 3.75 (This beer is good but I would not likely drink it again) Man…had high hopes for this but honestly just didn’t enjoy it that much. The aroma was great, but the taste put me off. It was too spicy/hot for me and the bourbon seemed to get completely lost. Given the BA rating and how outstanding Jackie O’s is with stouts, I apparently set my expectations too high.	4
5469	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	I finally got to try Bourbon Barrel Aged Oro Negro and it was great. It lived up to the hype. It is brewed with Walnuts, conditioned on spices and Aged in Bourbon Barrels. What an explosion of flavors. It is a wonderful stout.. Look: Black with a thin mocca colored head. Aroma: roasted malts, chocolate, nuts, bourbon..  486 characters	4.65
5470	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Jet black with a two finger head, cinnamon is certainly present along with cacao and a little vanilla. I get the touch of heat but booze as well. The two together make this complex but a too much so, it doesn't jive for me the way other Jackie's do, but it is still quite drinkable and so I will.	4.49
5471	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	A 12.7 fl. oz. bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Dark dark brown to black in colour with a thin beige head that disappeared almost immediately while leaving some sparse spotty lacing.. Aroma: Mexican hot chocolate, light roast, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, chili and wood, with maybe even some light nuttiness..  762 characters	4.47
5472	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Would I buy this again? Yes - Id be in for the full allotment. Overall exceptional beer.. Walnut forward taste with nice spicy-heat backbone.. Not much head retention which let me down some and smell was nutty and bourbon-y, but spices arent immediately present.	4.69
5473	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Served in a snifter. Review #1675. Dark brown and medium bodied in appearance. Both lighter in color and thinner in viscosity than I anticipated. A larger bubbled, near finger-tall mass of tan colored froth topped the liquid. The head quickly transformed into a thick, clingy collar. Odd-shaped patches and tiny droplets of lacing coated the glass and stuck around until almost the drink’s end..  1,609 characters"	4.45
5474	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	2018 vintage - Pours black with a fairly dense creamy tan foam head. The smell of this beer from the bottle was an amazing sensory experience. It is reminiscent of something like a dark chocolate covered toasted brown bread with a dash of cinnamon on top. In the glass aromas of creamy vanilla and sweet cinnamon hit up front with a habanero pepper spice laying beneath, with rich dark chocolate, toasty brown bread, walnuts, oak barrel, some bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy pine. The flavor is a blast of equal proportions. Rich dark chocolate, cinnamon, habanero pepper spice, creamy vanilla, toasted brown bread, walnuts, oak, bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy piney hops to balance. Feels lighter medium bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real great bourbon barrel aged imperial stout.	4.9
5475	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	"L — Pours a pitch black body with a scant half finger of light brown head. Minimal retention and lacing
S — Bourbon, prune, bittersweet chocolate, smoke, vanilla, caramel, oak. Comes across as a pure BA stout, not one with a bunch of adjuncts added.
T — Rich fudge, cinnamon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chili heat, dried dark fruit, hint of tobacco leaf and leather. Everything is integrated so wonderfully. So decadent
F — Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. More thick and oily than velvety and fluffy, but that’s ok
O — This beer really knocked my socks off. As a lover of this style of flavored stout who frequently finds the chili heat to be too mild, this one really has that perfect level of spice. Pricey, but you get what you pay for. 91/100"	4.52
5476	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	"Not Shure why some ratings are low. This bottle was from a trade as an extra and stayed in the stash for a while so it has been aged. Definitely not the""hot mess"" I have seen some reviewers describe.. Look dark and minimal head. Smell cinnamon, chocolate, barrel, pepper..  522 characters"	4.41
5477	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal/roast/char bitterness, and bourbon/oak/pepper/cinnamon spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak/spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1% and pepper heat; with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial spiced stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Amazingly rich malt complexity, perfectly balanced spices, and bourbon barrel presence/integration. Not overwhelming on any aspect. A bit more soft and mellowed out on spice after the barrel aging. A highly enjoyable offering as expected. Liked it just a bit more than the base beer.	4.35
5478	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Pours jet black with a ittle bit of chocolate colored foam.. Smell is rich and sweet, with notes of walnuts, chocolate, coffee, golden syrup and vanilla.. Taste takes all the elements from the nose and adds oak, booze and slightly hot chilis..  370 characters	4.19
5479	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	L - pitch black with a two fingers mocha head. S - cinnamon, cocoa powder, walnut. T - very spicy with habanero pepper and cinnamon. The bourbon aging smooths the whole thing out. It also brings some coconut notes. Some vanilla is noted but I don't know if it's from the vanilla added or the barrel aging. Certainly has a bite.  435 characters	4.6
5480	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Pours a jet black with a tight light tan head. Nose is of spices. Cinnamon, a bit of heat and dark roasted malts. Taste is extremely mellow. I mean that in a good way. This is a extremely easy drinking and pleasant beer for being a BA Imperial Stout. Notes of roasted malt, black coffee, caramel, candied bourbon, cinnamon and vanilla. Finished of with a slightest touch of heat from the peppers and bourbon heat. A little nuttiness in there as well. Silky medium to full body with a bit of chewiness to it. Really enjoyed this one. It’s smooth!	4.43
5481	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	2017 16.9 ounce bottle poured into tulip. After a somewhat heavy pour, there was minimal head. Like just a small tan ring of medium bubbles, not impressive on first impression. Dark as night body. Chocolate, coffee, roast and walnut finish on the nose. Taste is where this shines! Dark chocolate, smooth bourbon and wood, mild cinnamon, dark fruits, vanilla. Building spice from the habanero but I'm not deterred. Big, chewy body with easy drinkability.	4.38
5482	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	This one pours a fairly dark black, with a small head, and not much lacing.. This smells quite hot and spicy on the nose ,with earthy and spicy cinnamon, sweet bourbon, oak, and a little bit of vanilla.. Like most Jackie O's beer, this flies way under the radar but is utterly delicious. There is a super killer cinnamon character to this- it's perfect- present but not overbearing. I don't get much of the base walnut character, but there's some nice biting pepper character, some light bourbon, and a hint of vanilla. The base is nice and chocolatey as well..  637 characters	4.64
5483	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	"Reviewed on 9/27/17, from notes. L - Pours motor oil brown with a medium mocha head
S - I get big bourbon notes. Lots of brown sugar and molasses. If I inhale deeply I also get big cinnamon notes.
T - Best way to describe it is chocolate and marshmallow with a caramel middle. Slight bitter and cinnamon chili spice on the finish
F - Nice and creamy medium body. A little chewy.
O - Very well balanced barrel aged chili stout. The smell was amazing."	4.46
5484	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	2017 bottle. The base beer is 2016 Oro.. I liked non-BA version 2017 over 2016. Perhaps 2018 BA Oro will be better than 2017 BA.. More cinnamon-y and spicy-er than 2016..  287 characters	4.21
5485	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Pours pitch black with light tan head and minimal lacing.. Aroma is booze upfront, then walnuts, chocolate, vanilla .. Taste follows the aroma . Booze upfront. I think in 6 months this would be much better.  411 characters	4.27
5486	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	2017 release.. A: Pours essentially black with a cap of dense, espresso-like tan head. Very persistent ring of foam.. S: Rich dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, cinnamon stick, and walnuts (which I think is the source of a cardboard-like impression). Mild alcohol burn..  820 characters	4.22
5487	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Jet black, tan head a few random gobs of lacing left behind. The smell is loaded with bourbon, oak, vanilla molasses, habaneros and chocolate. The flavor is very sweet up front with some oak and bourbon. This gives way to some chocolate vanilla and molasses. There is a char bitterness and the flavor of the peppers at the end. Finishes with a nice little heat. This is a damn fine beer.	4.6
5488	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	High expectation and kind of a mess in delivery. I got some notes of oxidation, more than I am comfortable with. Among the very pleasant vanilla spice notes was a subtle vegetal note from the chilis. I think my preference lies in the base beer.	3.93
5489	Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro	Black color with mocha head. Aroma has intense bourbon, butterscotch and caramel with some spices on top. Taste is really complex with herb liquor, booze, spices, chili, cinnamon, quite hot but really tasty and intense. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. Really tasty but quite hot from the chillies and the bourbon.	4.6
5490	Thicket	Poured into a tulip glass. A clear ruby red color with a fleeting pinkish head. Scant wispy laces in the glass. Aroma had rich oak barrel, vanilla, blackberries, cherries, currants, and funk. Fairly tart on the first sip and with the bright fruity notes above. Lemony on the finish. Complex and all the elements shined. Delicious.	4.47
5491	Thicket	Blend #2. 2019 release.. A: Pours a deep burgundy, nice clarity and effervescence, with a cap of fizzy purplish-pink head that dissipates rapidly leaving a still surface. No lacing.. S: Blackberry, grape juice, and light oak effortlessly meld with a medium-light barnyard funk..  655 characters	4.2
5492	Thicket	Had at a beer share with 2 good friends a few months ago. We had been trying to acquire this for a long time, we finally tracked it down and it was worth the wait!	5
5493	Thicket	Pours a beatufil purple with minimal lacing. Smell is of sour blackberry - sour coming from lacto, I am assuming. The blackberry is so strong. Taste follows the nose, strong sour blackberry flavor with a decently sharp acidity. Feel is super bubbly/effervescent. Very clean on the pallet. Overall, it is probably the best blackberry sour I have had, but falls well short of smooth and fuzzy	4.34
5494	Thicket	poured from a 375mL bottle into a wine glass. pours a beautiful dark red with pinkish white head. smells of blackberry jam with some acidic funk. taste is similar with the jamminess taking the forefront. this is some tart cider! sour and acidic. feel is appropriate for the style. not overly bubbly. definitely on the thicker side of things. overall, damn sour but one of my favorites of the SP 375s.	4.6
5495	Thicket	"L: clearish red with no head.
S: super tart. Smells more like cherries than blueberries.
T: just like the nose. Super tart, berry sweetness throughout.
F: high carbonation, but still smooth."	4.5
5496	Thicket	A: A deep red, almost purple. White head that sticks for a while. S: Blackberries and a lot of them. Oak, hay, lemon zest, vinegar. T: Yep that's perfect. Juicy blackberries, tart blackberries. Some oak to dry the back end and that signature SP tartness/sour to let you know it means business. M: Enough carb to make it palatable, but not a lot to make it soft. Oak dryness on the backend end. O: This is killer. I've had a few SP bottles now and this one is amazing. Not the most sour of the bunch, but very complex and well balanced	4.77
5497	Thicket	Appearance: Pours auburn brown with a modest head; decent retention. Smell: Tart blackberry, with defined lactic tones; hints of grain in the back. Taste: Lactic and acetic tartness from the outset, with the blackberry tones building; the tartness builds through the middle and finish but never overwhelms.  433 characters	4.24
5498	Thicket	Incredible beer. Thanks to @jdhowe for the share. Beautiful purplish hue with strong blackberry aroma. Very sour, but not too acidic. A little funk, but probably more on the nose. Delicious beer.	4.78
5499	Thicket	Deep purple color. Nice sour blackberry in aroma. A little sharp at first, but the blackberries come out nicely in the finish. A little funky but falls more on the sour and acidic side. Really nice overall, nicely done blackberry sour.	4.49
5500	Thicket	"375ml bottle, generously shared by Erik, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 6.20.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. 
The beer pours a really nice purple/red color, opaque and hazy, really reminiscent of a blackberry with a slightly off white head, about a finger high that has nice retention and good lace. The aroma is welcoming, lots of blackberry, acidic red wine, hearty oak, funky yeast, lemon zest and tangy red grape linger well. The flavors are quite enjoyable, tart and fresh blackberry, juicy and jammy, red wine acidity, chewy oak, good funk, a little cheesy with a nice amount of mustiness, lemon zest cuts into the sourness a little, despite it's tart character, but offers some brightness and like the nose, lingering red grape and currants, fleshy and puckery. The mouthfeel is good, coating, zippy and lively with high carbonation levels, good dry tartness and an easy finish that has a crisp kick.. 
Verdict: A nice Wild Ale from Side Project, not overly sour, which I find to be a typical attribute with their fruited sours. Tart, acidic, balanced and a nice blackberry expression, not quite as epic and Fuzzy or Framboise du Fermier in terms of the representation of the fruit used, but very enjoyable nonetheless."	4.19
5501	Thicket	Thanks to Kyle. Beautiful purple pour. Jammy, seedy, fruit is very expressive. Acetic sour notes are strong but fruit remains bold and present..  204 characters	4.62
5502	Thicket	In my opinion, the least acidic, most fruit forward of the Side Project 375ml bottles. For me, it was also the easiest to drink, along with Blancs. Tons of mildly tart blackberries, with lots of blackberry skin noticeable throughout the beer. The oak presence is very noticeable with a hint of red wine. This was a fantastic.	4.67
5503	Thicket	Pours a dark burgundy with slight head that fades quickly and minimal lacing. Aroma hits right away with fresh sour blackberries and red wine. The taste follows the nose. There's a bit of lemon and some red wine vinegar along with a buttery component that comes through as it warms. Mouth feel is light to medium. Very good overall. Glad I got to try this.	4.25
5504	Thicket	Pours a light reddish brown body with slight pink hues, half finger white head with surprisingly good retention time, nice lacing. Smells of tart lactic acidity, blackberry puree. Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part. It's acidic with a moderate blackberry presence, that's pretty much all she wrote.	4.24
5505	Thicket	One of my favorite side project beers. Still had that typical Side Project lacto but the fruit comes through in this one much more than a lot of their other beers.	4.71
5506	Thicket	375 mL bottle poured into a snifter.. Appearance - Deep purple. Lightly pink head. Very pretty beer.. Smell - Strong berry. Wine barrel, too. Strong vinous notes..  509 characters	3.95
5507	Thicket	"Appearance: Beautiful dark blackberry juice. Medium size head due to the high carbonation (starting in the bottle once I cracked the cap). I was afraid I was in for a ""gusher"" but it held off.. Smell: Wow, blackberries to the max. Jammy along with a strong acidity right from the nose. I could smell this brew for hours.. Taste: SOUR! Before the blackberries could hit I was struck by a huge sourness that got you right in the jaw like a Sour Patch Kid. While I do love sours, this was a but much right off the bat. As the brew warmed the sourness subsided (or maybe I was just getting use to it). Aside from the sourness you get, you guessed it, tons of jammy blackberries. As it warmed I got a slightly buttery and briny flavor as I sipped. Interesting and I liked it..  1,055 characters"	4.43
5508	Thicket	Poured into a Side Project stem from a 375ml bottle. Purchased at release.. Pours a dark purple and burgundy with a nice slightly lilac head that is about 1 inch and quite active. Very lively head that recedes quickly down to a thin ring.. Aroma is wonderufll. Fruit juice, berry and jammy. Then tartness and lactic acid notes that aren't too intense or overwhelming. Notes of wood are present as well. Nice woody earthy notes. Slight funk..  703 characters	4.9
5509	Thicket	Pours thick and opaque with a high effervescence and no head. It is a rich purple and looks like homemade blackberry jam. Smell is like other Side Project fruited sours: large amounts of fresh ripe fruit (in this case, blackberries) and a lacto yogurty sourness. In this case, the fruit shine over the lacto. Taste is extremely sour but not as sour as Fencerow or Fuzzy. Tastes like unsweetened yogurt with fresh tart blackberries. A defined sour acidity lingers on the aftertaste with a hint of red wine tannins. Mouthfeel is well carbed and very dry. Overall, a fantastic beer that balances the fruit and sourness better than every other SP fruited sour other than Blanc.	4.62
5510	Thicket	My 2000th rating! Served at cellar temp, and poured into my HF oversized wine glass.. A- Pours a deep, dark violet with some pink hues around the edges when held to the light. A medium sized light pink head swiftly fizzles away, leaving only a collar, and some fine lacing. Small berry particles can be seen floating near the top.. S- The aroma is fantastic! Sweet blackberry meets lactic tartness and acidity. Blackberry yogurt comes to mind. Some nice oaky notes and sweet red wine add to the complexity. Lastly there is some tart granny smith apple. Delightful!.  1,088 characters	4.62
5511	Thicket	"375ml bottle poured into a large stem.. A: Pours dark purple with ruby edges. A thin purple-hued head forms and quickly fades into a lingering collar.
S: Tart, funky, and full of freshly pureed fruit.
T: Extremely layered; tartness up front moving quickly into a nice full funk, bright blackberries, wood/oak elements, sour fruit skins/tannins, blackberry seeds/earthiness/slight balsamic quality.
M: Well carbonated but not overly done, initially very bubbly, but quickly fades; medium bodied with a definite sweet/fruity viscosity.
O: Simply fantastic, expertly crafted wild ale with incredible fresh fruit notes balanced with the perfect level of funk/tartness."	4.87
5512	Thicket	Beautiful color, head fades quickly. Nose is muted. Harsh sourness, slight buttery aroma / flavor (not unpleasant - perhaps just a barrel note), some acetone / nail polish. The fruit flavor, while authentic, wasn't deep. Little funky or character outside of acidity, touch of fruit, some wine butteriness. Consumed at the same time as several De Garde lambic based beers - The Lucy, The Lily - and this couldn't hold a candle to them ... and I say this as someone who finds Side Project saisons about as good as saisons get.	4.13
5513	Thicket	Poured into a tulip. Pours a gorgeous dark burgundy. The nose is just killer on this one with a very unique barnyard character along with dark berries. The flavor is super jammy tart blackberry. Just a wonderfully crafted sour.	4.81
5514	Thicket	Bottle courtesy of Joe, just like every other good beer I rate here. Poured to a Cantillon taster. Pours dark purple and slightly murkey with a beautiful bubbly pinkish purple head on top that fizzes away after a minute or two. Super funky aroma, with vinegar and barnyard, serious dry oakiness, and a bit of jammy berry. Flavor is very fruit forward with lots of jammy raspberries, but then the puckering sour hits your tongue and follows all the way down the throat. Acidic and lambic like, dry oak flavors, lacto like crazy, and finishes puckering and dry. Somehow the fruit still shines here, though. Dry, medium light bodied, with spritzy carbonation. This is good stuff for sure.	4.63
5515	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	2014 version poured into a snifter. I'm generally a fan of the Eclipse variants and this one, for me, does not disappoint. This version is well balanced. As others I am sure have noted, these beers don't come cheap but the quality warrants trying a version once in your life.	4.35
5516	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"Bottle from 2015. A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a dense and rocky finger of light tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, oak, vanilla and caramel.
T: Taste is fairly chocolatey up front with some coffee mixed in, some nice smoke and charred wood with some oak, caramel and vanilla and some burnt sugar. On the swallow there's more oak, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and slight smoke.
M: This beer is fairly full in body with a slightly creamy feel on the palate. Carbonation is good for the style and slightly effervescent while the beer has a drying finish.
O: Overall this is a really nice beer. It has some great flavors and complexity while also striking a great balance between all the different flavors. Nothing really stands out too tall over the other flavors. This is one to try if you can find it. It may be on the expensive side but it's worth it."	4.5
5517	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"2012 vintage (BR/3""); drank 3/5/16 @ the Yarchives.. Brown/black appearance.. Small tan head; minimal lace..  379 characters"	4.5
5518	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	(on tap at Pinocchio's 9th anniversary event... served in a 5 oz snifter). Rather mute and one-note, with only a little bourbon presence... big dominant flavor is that of a malty dark chocolate chip milk; luckily not a sweet and syrupy chocolate, but chocolate and little else... little roast, little char... I do fondly remember the delicious flavors of Elijah Craig 12-yr, and there was very little here to reminisce about... really dangerously smooth, with the alcohol very well hidden, but probably wouldn't buy a bottle	3.8
5519	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	In review is a 2012 Vintage.. A - Pitch black pour with moderate toffee lacing, lots of legs on the sides of the glass, sticky lacing, little to no carbonation.. S - Roasted chocolate malt, a hint of charcoal on the nose, bourbon, and a little bit of oak. The overall nose is extremely mellow (probably because of the age of the bottle)..  813 characters	4.43
5520	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Straight brilliant. Nice to have stout that is so well executed, and without a tone of additives. So much going on and all of it from the base beer and barrel.	4.62
5521	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"2011 Bottling; # 3266. Picked up from Matt at Capone's at release. Cellared since then. Been saving this from a mixed case full of Eclipse back in the day.
Unsure if original or based on aging...but what I thought was going to be a powerhouse instead was a gentle sipper of immense complexity.
Am I huge fan of Elijah Craig bourbon, and was delighted with its characteristic enveloping vanilla, caramel sweetness and strains of resin from the barrel. The chocolate comes through in both nose and taste. Hints of citrus rind bitterness and molasses.
Had an attractive color with dark brown an hints/sparks of ruby in the light. No residual head/lacing... as might be expected. No ABV and very smooth carbonation; very slightly syrupy. Enhancement not a concern. Gentle sipper, seductively sweet and delicious.
FWIW...agree with others..there are many many good BA Imp Stouts out there these days. And I also get worried when more that $1/oz.
But I would still recommend this if you get a chance to grab a 2011."	4.49
5522	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Pours an opaque brownish black color with quickly dissipating tan head and fair amount of residual lacing.Nose is very mild chocolate sweetness ,a bit of bourbon barrel and a touch of honey. Taste follows nose ,feels a bit on the thin side. Not quite a disappointment, but not the best value. Definitely a one and done, mainly due to cost.There are a whole lotta BA stouts out there for way less $$ that easily give this a run for the money.Don't get me wrong ,this is very,very good -just way over priced.	4.39
5523	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	2015 bottle. Wow, amazing nose fudgey, very smooth. Thick just enough on the mouthfeel. Not boozy at all. Not too thick but looks nice and dark. Smells like classic Eclipse	4.94
5524	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"Reviewed on 6/5/17. 2016 bottle. L - Pours a dark brown with a thin mocha colored head.
S - I get notes of milk chocolate sugary sweetness and bourbon.
T - Subtle chocolate flavors and honey sweetness on the finish. A bit of a weird aftertaste.
F - A little thin
O - Just not a lot going on here and there is little balance. Kind of a disappointment considering it's price and reputation. Not worth the hype."	4.04
5525	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Poured dark and thick. Aromas of oak, vanilla, whiskey, and dark chocolate. Drank very nice and smooth with the oak and dark chocolate flavors coming through well. Delicious	4.29
5526	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Pour is jet black, thick tan head. Aromas are led by the barrel, but the dark chocolate aromas are present, as is the honey.. The taste has the dark chocolate evolving to a rich cocoa flavor, which may be the combination of the dark chocolate flavors and the honey. Whatever it is, I absolutely LOVE it. There's also a boozy burn present, but it's well onto the back of the palate, and isn't overwhelming in any way.. I wish I'd purchased three bombers of this, because it is exceptionally well executed.	4.5
5527	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Solid stout here. Nice head and lace. The base beer is good enough. I don't get a great deal of smooth barrel here. Has a little bite. After taste is so so. I had another version a while ago that was much better. Can't remember the wax color.	3.78
5528	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Pours a dark chocolate color. Aroma is mellow barrel with a touch of Carmel vanilla boozines. Flavor follows the nose. Nice chocolate with some char and a good Carmel vanilla bourbon flavor. A little thin but overall fantastic.	4.44
5529	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Drank the 2012 bottle...Not sure how this one has not fallen off the BA Top 250 list. It was a solid BA Stout but I have had dozens of BA stouts that were better than this one. I recently had the Pappy Eclipse and it was better than this one. Shared with friends recently at a small share. Who knows...maybe the 2012 sat too long	4.28
5530	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Nice looking beer with a nearly opaque color and a nice foamy tan head that lingered. Whiskey, coffee, cocoa, and caramel on the nose. The taste was a bit too much whiskey for me, but there was a nice sweetness and roastiness from the honey to balance things out. Not overly cloying, but essentially two dominant aspects (whiskey and honey) that battle it out. Definitely not subtle.	4.17
5531	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"Had a 2017 bottle poured into a Teku and savored. Pours a little more viscous than most other beers, which I regard as a good sign.. It pains me to do it because I appreciate the effort that went into this beer, but I rate it a category below ""world class"".. This is a big, complex, and great beer, but it aims higher than it achieves. The 3 main components of this beer are plainly evident immediately upon drinking it: imperial stout, honey, and barrel-aging. This does give it a lot of complexity, especially as IS is complex to begin with and then you add honey and BA. But one flaw is that these 3 elements do not combine together to create something new. They exist side by side..  1,847 characters"	3.96
5532	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	2014 ventage - Very dark appearance with thin dark tan/brown head that desipates quickly. Aroma is a complex fruity with a hint of bourbon. Taste is very smooth bourbon and fruit without any hint of alcohol aftertaste. The aging is well worth the wait.	4.48
5533	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Poured from the bottle into a taster. Bourbon, oak, some nice roasted malts and chocolate. Very well balanced overall, with a full bodied, solid mouthfeel. Well done beer!	4.43
5534	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	Black with a dark tan fuzzy blanket.. Smell is almost smokey, spiced rye malt, with caramel, coffee and sweet bourbon.. Taste is powdered cocoa and dark chocolate with raisin and a mature bourbon character while not being hot, all over a full, thick body.	3.97
5535	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	he flavor, though, surprised me; it doesn’t follow the aroma. I taste dry malt, pine needles, faint citrus. Slick mouthfeel, yet dries the tongue with some lingering cloying.	4.71
5536	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"Look: Ptch black, with nice fluffy khaki head.
Smell: Strong Bourbon smell, chocolate, roasted malts.
Taste: Bourbon, marshmallows, hot fudge Sunday.
Feel: Roasty and complex. The bourbon is not over powering.
Overall: Real smooth and easy drinking for a double digit Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout."	4.77
5537	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"Enjoyed a 2013 last night with my old man.. Everything about this beer just defined the word smooth, from the pour itself through to the finish. Nothing jumped out about any particular flavors, just tremendous balance throughout. The 3+ years of age (plus 12 year-old Elijah) have done this brew wonders, as the barrel has been tamed down to a wonderful subtleness. It shows itself just enough so you know you're drinking something barrel-aged, but that's all - something not often said about a big stout, such as this. In fact, considering the rather muted barrel and lighter, smoother viscosity, I could have probably drunk the entire bottle, which I normally can never do with any bomber. Curious how this tastes ""fresh,"" but with the $30 price point, that's likely to only happen with trade.. Cheers!"	4.83
5538	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"Pitch black, light creme colored head with some minimal retention
Inviting, warm smells of sweet malt, honey, maple almost, some slight whiskey tones come through
Dark fruit, dark chocolate, raw honey, heavy oak/woody presence, finishes with a strong whiskey taste
Chewy feel but not quite as expected, a bit more syrupy than full bodied
Heavy on the barrel, I like it"	4.46
5539	Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year)	"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that died down, leaving a thin webbing of bubbles covering the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of bourbon are present in the nose along with hints of honey.
T: The taste has lots of flavors of vanilla from the bourbon barrel aging—once it stats to warm up the bourbon also becomes prominent as well. Notes of honey are present in the finish.
M: It feels full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This imperial stout is big and bold. It tastes strong, but does a good job at masking most of the alcohol from the taste.. Note: 2016 vintage. Serving type: bottle"	4.39
5540	Juicy	Batch #4 release - drank on 6/29/2019. Just a bit funky with that characteristic Hill Farmstead barnyard tasting note. Sour, lots of dry hopping, but still pleasantly juicy. Quite good. Thanks to jhavs!	4.75
5541	Juicy	Tartness up front that gives way to granny smith apples, tannic grape skins and funky Brett. A bit earthy. Complex. Slick feel. Crisply carbed and zippy. Semi dry finish. Perfect for a humid night like tonight.	4.4
5542	Juicy	The beer pours a some what Clear copper orange with a large fluffy white head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of kiwi, white grape gooseberry, white wine, orange marmalade, and grapefruit. It tastes of kiwi, gooseberry, white grape, white wine, orange marmalade, and barnyard funk. The feel is light and juicy. This is an amazing wine ba saison, it’s tropical, juicy, and funky.	4.74
5543	Juicy	Hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma has tart fruits, fermented notes, herbs and a bit of fruit vinegar. Taste is balanced, fruity, mineral with bitter fruit pits and almonds. Medium body with low carbonation. Quite nice wild ale with lots of farmhouse funk and fruit flavors.	4.3
5544	Juicy	375 mL bottle from December 2016. Decanted carefully in case of sediment, Juicy pours an orange-copper with a thin layer of head from bubbles that rise up in a curiously slow way, as if the liquid is more viscous than it otherwise seems. Beautiful aromas of white wine, apple cider vinegar, papaya, honeydew melon, and orange blossom. The perfect amount of bright acidity on the tongue, enough to get the salivary glands pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the delicate complexity of flavors on parade here. I'm loving the influence of the wine barrels.	4.32
5545	Juicy	Appearance: With a nice hearty, vigorous pour, the beer produced about a 2.5 finger of soft, white foamy head. About half of the foam laced the glass after about a minute or two of sitting.. Aroma: It smells of wine barrel, oak, tart cherry and other fruity aromas.. Taste: On the first sip, I pick up some tart funk, some straw, some wine barrel. At the very end of the sip, there is a really subtle, slight bitter finish. It is really refreshing and enjoyable..  737 characters	4.56
5546	Juicy	Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. L: Clear golden copper pour. 1.5 fingers of foamy white head... falls fast, great rim of lacing.. S: Tart and oaky... white wine and tannin, lightly fruity..  602 characters	4.5
5547	Juicy	2016 bottle (Batch 3) into Hill Farmstead flute bottle.. Light amber in color with a good bit of foam head upon an aggressive pour. Wonderful floral aromas and taste. Fruity flavor. Brett is present but not offensive. Not overly tart or overly acidic. Very balanced saison that is pleasant and easy to drink. One of the best I've had.	4.6
5548	Juicy	First pour displays a slight chill haze, yet still allows for a sparkling amber body with a thin creamy white head that fades to a film with a creamy ring and some rolling hills of lace. The full pour yields full haze.. Smell is divine. Simple yet complex. Apple, pear, white wine oak, a hint of light aged cheese funk, and sharp passionfruit.. Juicy starts smooth and round on the palate with some soft carbonation, a crisp tart middle, and a sharp, tart, tingly, semi-dry finish...but what are these flavors? Seriously! It's so well-made and integrated it's a challenge identifying descriptors. Pear. Passionfruit. Nelson-like hops. Crisp, tart tangerine. White wine oak. It's champagne-esque, but also nearing balsamic territory. Kiwi! All kept anchored by some bitter grapefruit rind..  1,093 characters	4.22
5549	Juicy	Nice bit of Brett on the nose. Bigger, bolder body than many HF base saisons. Sweetness is matched by the Brett and wine character. White grape. Some fruit cocktail juiciness. Lower carb than typical. Balanced notes from the barrel, Brett, and fruit flavors. Guessing the fruit comes from the barrel and maybe hops. Very interesting beer and quite delicious.	4.64
5550	Juicy	"2016 vintage (bottle) at the brewery
A: pours a mostly clear copper color with a quickly receding fizzy white head
S: suggestions of pepper and funk, with an understated tartness, there is a sharpness in the nose that suggests cheese though not as much as in other beers of this ilk
T: pulled back a touch, definite funk and tartness but surprising mild, with a clean biscuity malt profile, followed by some hints of lemon and apple, definite hints of pepper as well, this beer sits comfortably somewhere in between a classically defined saison and a farmhouse ale, neither malt heavy nor funk/sour heavy, as it settles out, some of the tartness dies down
M: definitely dry, but with a fullness that lingers on the tongue
O: excellent but not revelatory, definitely lives up to its name in the juicy department, not my favorite kind of farmhouse ale, but great for what it is. Balanced, and immediate in presentation, allowing for the nuances to drift gradually out from under the more prominent and defining notes."	4.01
5551	Juicy	12 fl oz bottle sealed with silver pressure cap.. bottled on 10/10/2015.. poured into HF wine stem..  1,552 characters	4.44
5552	Juicy	Cloudy orange appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a definite grapefruit and other citrus. Taste is also definitely grapefruit with other citrus. Smooth with a little dryness and bitterness at the end.	4.27
5553	Juicy	375 ml bottle from December, 2016. Obtained in a trade. Hope it's still good as it certainly was well cared for.. L: Maybe 1F head poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass. Not much retention, no lacing, only a thing ring. Beer is a very attractive clear deep copper.. S: Definitely getting a lot of the wine barrel (guessing chardonnay) and brett. Some grapefruit and lemon, maybe..  1,113 characters	4.34
5554	Juicy	Pleasantly surprised on how much of a treat this was. Big thanks to VermontHiker. This was not at all what I expected, completely surprised me and the nose was really something to behold. Bottle date 2015 on this one, need a fresh bottle to see what all this time did to it. A lot of bread, grapes, grass, wine and hop bitterness in both nose and taste. The wine barrels seemingly diminish whatever profound tartness wants to come out and punch you in the jaw. I'll drink this again and again and again. This is a beer I'd like to drink every weekday on warm summer nights....for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as much as of their fire. JUICY!	4.56
5555	Juicy	This was an excellent saison that I could drink forever. Very smooth and delicious. Reminded me of champagne almost with the wine flavors coming through and the great base saison coming together.	4.51
5556	Juicy	Dark golden in color almost amber with an off white head that dissipated quickly but kept a cap and great lacing throughout the drink.. Nose is spicy with a lot of citrus pith and a hint of tartness. Hill Farmstead signature house character is definitely there.. Taste follows with a super citrusy hop type profile and a little grass and dried citrus peel on the finish. Completely dry and finishes swift. Extremely drinkable..  470 characters	4.55
5557	Juicy	Nose is tropical brett and a little back end funk. The palate is really clean slight tart finish plenty of sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes.. Damn good beer really clean and palateable.	4.66
5558	Juicy	an extremely impressive little bottle of saison here, wonderfully hoppy and wild, and quite literally juicy in its overall complexion. pale and bright on the pour, fizzy at first but settling back quickly, less hazy than anticipated, but not all the way clear, lots of little bubbles rising up. the aroma forces an almost smelling salts sort of response from me, with an involuntary jerk back of the head, whew this is pungent. right away i get strong wine tannins, a mature bretty funk the gives to a lambic sort of oaky sourness, and of course the unmistakable new zealand hops, which seem dry hoppy right away. my mouth waters like i cant remember, so i set right in on the first swig. a big whoosh of carbonation takes the beer right to the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue, the whole palate is getting in on this right from the get go. amazing wild yeast complexion, thats what i love most about this one, super funky farmy brett with soft green apple, meyer lemon, and even white grape notes, dry but sort of richer or more complete of a brett spectrum than most, but this sort of moves into a more bacterial citric pucker, also mature and fully wild, like real lambic, it certainly has that almost medicinal start and the inoculated woody later bit, its certainly at least that complex. the hops are fruity too, pineapple comes to mind, more white wine. the wood is soft, the mouthfeel is aided by that, and its flavor is as woody as it is winey, with a nice herbal botanical input from the hops at its peak. tangy and sour, but not so much so that we didnt wish this came in a three liter bottle, my whole palate wanted the whole bottle, but i felt compelled to share it. highly carbonated and fuller bodied, but delicate in its overall presentation. dry but not all the way. one of the better and more nuanced but also aggressively flavored hill farmstead beers i have had, truly distinct and memorable, i can still taste it even. this is about as much as you can do with brett saison, especially for not having fruit in it, an enormously delicious beer. huge thanks to my trading buddy back east!	4.54
5559	Juicy	Batch 3 shared on 3-4-16. Pours on the darker side of yellow. Pretty hazy. Juicy is a great description of the beer overall, because that is what I got from nose to finish. A sweet tangelo like presence on the nose, followed by a melon like sweetness on the palate with a slight bitter and juicy finish. Really well made beer.	4.49
5560	Juicy	Pours a light amber carbonated color. Aroma is tart funky and I think I get citrus. Flavor follows the nose. Flavor is delicious. Some tarness a little funk ang definitely juiciness. Nice feel and overall this is fantastic.	4.56
5561	Juicy	"Bottled 12/16, poured into my mini snifter, because I enjoy my beer incrementally when it is this good!
Pour is like carbonated apple juice, little to no head.
Smell is wine and not too funky funk. But funk fo sho.
Taste... after hovering over this glass with my nose for a good two minutes... awesome. Big wine, solid funk, and both of those carry through with smooth finish I would name ""RR Supplication light"" (intended as the highest compliment!)
Feel is where Juicy really earns it's name. Huge flavor and funkiness present.
Really awesome. My first HF offering, and did not disappoint in any way."	4.65
5562	Juicy	L - pours a burnt copper rusted orange. Clear... until the bottom of the bottle and the yeast sets in... dun dun dun.... S - pungent straw and lemon. Definitely got some funk. Some tartness and a pointy, sharp vinous punch. Much darker than your traditional saisons.. T - more of the nose, with an even sharper flavor. Is there some booze in this? Tart and astringent lemon and hay. Twangy orange citrus. Deeply earthy, fruity flavors and a mixture of red and white wine. Raspberries and other medium hue fruits. Kalamata olives in the finish and a slight citric acidity that might be booze, might be hops, might be yeast?.  824 characters	4.63
5563	Juicy	"Onsite at the brewery:. Lovely clarity, honey-tinged pour with a slight fluffy head
Fruity/citrusy (galaxy definitely, mosaic maybe) hops, some acidity evident
Perfect tartness, not overbearing but present like a white wine dry hopped with galaxy
Nice light mouthfeel, dry finish
Overall, worth seeking out, sets the (ideal) bar for tartness in a saison imo"	4.43
5564	Juicy	Released Nov 2016, so about 3 months ago. Tulip glass.. A: Pours light orange tinted gold, very good clarity thin film of fine, bright white head with excellent retention.. S: Heavy barnyard character, fairly rich Vienna-like toast and slightly sweet malt and light citrus hops. Mild Sauvignon Blanc-like wine and candied gooseberry which suggest Nelson hops..  845 characters	4.41
5565	Space Trace	Nice looking stout. Smell is of bourbon, sweetness, and coconut. Taste follows the nose, nice rich flavor with bourbon and coconut dominating the palate. Some roastiness. Coats the tounge nice but slightly thin and is a little over carbed. Overall good coconut stout. The coconut could be stronger	4.2
5566	Space Trace	This beer is a coconut bomb! So good to go with the shavings. Would drink this everyday if the week if I could. Amazing stout for sure. Gotta get more.	4.64
5567	Space Trace	2018 bottle poured into large snifter. This has been a long time want for me and it was a big letdown. It was kind of a bitter mess. So dry, it was almost as if it were aged in cab franc barrels instead of bourbon. Barely any raw coconut with minimal sweetness. I seem to be the odd one out here. Maybe it was a bad bottle because I know the height of quality these guys usually reach with their barrel aged beers.	3.69
5568	Space Trace	This beer is throwing me for a loop. Second time I am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like FO than a chocolate coconut beer. Pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. You get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose. A little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character. Coconut doesn’t really stand out however. The taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms. A touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so. Another hit from bottle logic. Nice barrel, sweet, balanced and utterly delicious.	4.78
5569	Space Trace	2018 Bottle. Typical deep dark brown-black appearance with minimal foam around only edge of glass. Very nicely balanced sweet taste up front, with coconut coming out towards the end (and especially so as it warms). There's a good amount of chocolate presence here as well. Bourbon and booziness are well integrated also. Really good mouthfeel. Leaves the lips sticky after a few sips.. A lot of coconut beers make you feel like you're tasting Banana Boat suntan lotion (like Last Buffalo in the Park). This beer however doesn't do that. Coconut is there but because of it's well integrated with chocolate and bourbon sweet flavors, it's is just right.	4.47
5570	Space Trace	Space Trace is one of two beers procured by friends who wanted to help me out after my Dark Lord bottles were stolen. I don't know how they made this happen - something about New Glarus Strawberry Rhubarb bottles - but, I love Bottle Logic, and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to try Space Trace.. I was really startled by how barrel-forward Space Trace is. I'm a bit accustomed at this point to how vanilla forward many of their beers tend to be - but Space Trace smacks you in the face right away with a strong barrel nose and taste. It's follow by lots of chocolate and coconut, with very pleasant bourbon notes. It's a thick, rich beer, which is a very nice change from thin coconut beers (typically rum barrel-aged).. While I really love Space Trace, it's one that doesn't drink itself - it's delicious, but it's an active drinker - it requires attention and appreciation. I could only drink just a bit of it - certainly not a whole bottle - at a sitting. Then again, it's summer - so it may just be a seasonal thing! Feed me a bottle when the temperature dips below freezing and you may hear a very different review!	4.64
5571	Space Trace	Can a playa be blunt? Off the f-ing hook. Like Captain Hook on acid, this one is bat sh-t wild! Heavy, I mean heavy! (Like Oprah) but oh so smooth like Barbara Palvin in a 2 piece. I mean ay fu-king ay! Yes!	4.5
5572	Space Trace	Split with JLindros.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light wisps. Really nice legs.. S - Big aromas of chocolate galore, real nice coconut, roasted coconut meat and flakes, nice bourbon juice as well, light barrels..  655 characters	4.64
5573	Space Trace	Big thanks to rudzud. decent but smaller foamy creamy thick 1/2 finger head fades slowly, nice lacing, long legs, pitch black color. Nose loads of dark malt, roasted malt, charred black malt and some cocoa, dark chocolate cocoa, fair coconut, a little bourbon barrel notes, oaky, thick fudgey cocoa and a little alcohol,.  908 characters	4.59
5574	Space Trace	"2016 drank 9/21/2017
Look: dark brown black with a thin 1 inch khaki head
Smell: big bourbon front fallowed by coconut and a little chocolate.
Taste: chocolate, coconut, and bourbon... smooth but bourbon and chocolate forward.
Feel: smooth, semi milky, moderate body and feel
Overall: slightly over rated, big bourbon and cocoa... not much coconut"	4.35
5575	Space Trace	Goddamn, thanks for the pour Darren!. This one pours dark black, with no head or lacing.. This smells so strongly of sweet toasted coconut, high quality dark chocolate fudge, bourbon, and vanilla..  851 characters	4.76
5576	Space Trace	Slick motor oil black with a loud, dark mocha fizz that quickly dies off to nothing but a faint ring and never returns. Some oily specks decorate the surface thereafter.. Smell is big, waxy, nutty bourbon and oak right up front, tickling with some heat. Unabashedly supporting are decadent notes of chocolate fudge and a touch of coconut that's not quite toasted, but comes across as though it's fresh and added to a vanilla creme frosting.. Taste begins with sweet, creamy coconut frosting and dark, super sweet chocolate syrup working with nutty, peppery bourbon and splintery oak that builds in heat to a moderate degree..  774 characters	4.03
5577	Space Trace	Coconut snowflakes float along the surface of this pitch black beer. Thin, brown bubbles quickly retreat to the sides of the glass. Aroma is coconut cream, chocolate brownie, toffee candy, and bourbon soaked oak. Taste is more bourbon forward. Its a big, full bourbon flavor that seems to be evidence of time spent in the barrel. Rich dark fruit, vanilla, and toasted coconut reminiscent of the best bcbs vintages. It has some roast and smoke to it and that adds character. Coconut butter cream frosting is the icing on this chocolate cake. Mouth feel is full and carbonation is on point. This is almost a 4.75, but I prefer to see the base beer come through a little more. This is excellent and well worth the cost to acquire.	4.62
5578	Space Trace	"Pours dark black with quickly dissipating head.
The aroma is bourbon, chocolate and oak. I'm not getting a ton of coconut, it's over powered by the chocolate.
Huge chocolate flavors with a strong bourbon punch, the coconut is there, but it doesn't really come into play until the finish.
The mouthfeel isn't as thick as I'd like and it's a bit over carbonated.
Overall, it's very good, but I don't think it's worth what it pulls in a trade. Wait for bottle logics hype to die down before seeking this out."	4.25
5579	Space Trace	Pitch black with fast fading head, great cocoa and vanilla nose, and massive cocoa flavor. Coconut seems to hide out in the background. Nice full and smooth as silk mouthfeel ... so bottle logic!	4.63
5580	Space Trace	Poured from a 16oz bottle into a Bottle Logic snifter. Acquired in a trade.. Pours a deep black, oily body with a small dark brown head that reduces to leave almost no lacing or retention.. Aromas are packed with coconut, vanilla, bourbon, and light chocolate..  629 characters	4.6
5581	Space Trace	Poured into a BL FO glass. Nose is caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate fudge, and coconut of course. All of these flavors coat the palate as well. Full and flavorful, with plenty of coconut still present. My main complaint is that the fudge component dominates too much; it has a heavy, gooey mouthfeel and flavor that impedes the barrel characteristics. Still a nice beer though.	4.18
5582	Space Trace	Had the 2016 bottle. Look was nice dark with lots of coconut floating in it. Flakes were pretty big.. Smell is bourbon and chocolate and coconut..  278 characters	4.27
5583	Space Trace	A: Pours black, but had hazy oily finish on top... Ended up with stout snot in 3rd pour from glass.. S: Chocolate and Bourbon in the nose--no coconut detected. Beautiful smelling beer, one of top BA Stouts smells in my opinion.. T: Really, really good but not great. Chocolate comes through first and bourbon hits next with the coconut sweetening the bourbon slightly. Almost tasted like a coconut sweetened BCS..  813 characters	4.67
5584	Space Trace	Like a liquid mounds bar. The aromas are subtle, but definitely there from the glass. The magic really happens on the palette. The chocolate and coconut come through perfectly and are backed up by the smooth base beer. Barrel comes though, but only just enough to complement the beer and bring everything together.	4.66
5585	Space Trace	2016 vintage.. A: Pours pitch black with a thin medium brown head that fizzles out quickly.. S: Heavenly dark cocoa with coconut, a bit of vanilla bean and nuts, cardamom, and moderate bourbon. Like an insanely good bourbon-soaked chocolate bar..  664 characters	4.68
5586	Space Trace	Thick pour, fizzy, head fades super fast, no lacing, and pitch black. Strong aromas of bourbon, chocolate, and coconut. Notes of chocolate candy, bourbon, barrel, coconut, vanilla and chocolate liquor. Thick, smooth, no heat. Extremely solid stout with great flavors and perfect balance.	4.52
5587	Space Trace	Poured from the bottle into a taster. The definitely of a coconut bomb, with what appears to be flaked coconut floating on the top of my pour. A bit boozy, which negatively distracts from the overall experience.	4.39
5588	Space Trace	"Yeah this Space Trace is like straight up ""i'm a fuck you in the ass with a coconut""... and being tipsy, i oblige, etc etc, am I at 150 characters yet?"	4.63
5589	Space Trace	Thanks to a generous trade buddy I was fortunate to get a bottle of this. Probably one of, if not the, best barrel aged beer with coconut I've ever had. The coconut blended well with all the over flavors and barrel instead of sticking out as it's own taste. Incredibly smooth and just an overall fantastic beer.	4.86
5590	Sang Noir	2014 vintage; drank 10/29/15 @ Fischman's.. Opaque purple appearance.. Minimal khaki head; minimal lace..  351 characters	4.42
5591	Sang Noir	"750ml bottle. Caged and corked bottle. 2014 Project Vintage.
Dark brown colored body, with a cherry red hut when black lit. Slight tan fizzy head disappears quickly. No lacing.
Aroma of dark cherry fruit, along with oak barrel, with some bourbon barrel and a vinous wine barrel. The main aroma character is woody and dark cherry fruit.
Taste is sour, with a complex mix of what was in the aroma, plus a dark malt that almost goes to chocolate. Full of dark cherry, dark wine (port), and oak bourbon barrel. The end is rather dry, with the rich malt trailing off.
Medium plus mouth feel, and not quite a tooth scraper (because the sour is tempered by the malt). Good carbonation, with bubbles rising to feed a very thin ring.
The presentation color on this is striking and not often encountered, with the dark cherry combining with the dark brown. Smell and flavors are layered and many, but well blended in the end. In many ways this drinks like a dark red wine, but more sour. The higher ABV% is well hidden."	4.48
5592	Sang Noir	Pours essentially like a wine - deep purple, no head, very mild carbonation. Aroma is predominantly a gentle, dry red wine tannin with notes of wet oak, macerated dark cherries & some very subtle bourbon caramel that adds depth. The notes were right on but I felt it could have been a bit more expressive.. Taste begins with a tingling, tart cordial cherry that quite delicious - more oak tannin & earthy dark grape skin provide more of that wine flavor. The bourbon is subtle and borderline elusive, but it is there and adds a soft boozey heat. It isn’t over-tart like so many sours, and offers a few layers. Excellent.	4.62
5593	Sang Noir	Maybe this will grow on me but initial impression is too tart and acidic. I prefer a duchess de bourgeouene or however TF its spelled. I guess I'm a sour rookie.	4.15
5594	Sang Noir	"10oz pour into a snifter
On tap at the Pour House Channelside, Tampa, FL
Vintage 2016
Drank several months ago, but review was live at time of consumption.. A: Very dark red, almost brown (although it is quite dark in here). 1 fingers width of tan lacing with decent retention and tons of lacing. 4.75. S: Sweet, lots of oak, caramel malts, subtle tart. Nice aroma but not huge. 4.25.  704 characters"	4.66
5595	Sang Noir	Enjoyed after a nice rest in the cellar. Complex melange of aromas and taste - sour mash, oak, vinous grapes, dark fruit, puckering green apple and candied fruit.. Fruit acids, wine tannins, oak, bourbon starches and sugars - pleasantly tart and incredibly smooth. Hints of a well made manhattan.. No heat or zap from the ABV. Easy to drink and enjoy; nowhere near enamel stripping or harsh. A true beauty.	4.49
5596	Sang Noir	Dark brown with an amber tinge when held to the light, topped with 4 fingers of orangey beige head.. Smells sour of balsamic vinegar, funk, earthy, heather, leather, and slightly fruity of cherries and dates.. Sour smoothness. Sour of lemons, balsamic vinegar, lightened by an absent or phantom sweetness, cherries, funk, cellar, leather and peat..  533 characters	4.28
5597	Sang Noir	Deep brown in color with a very murky complexion. There's a fingernail of beige around the rim. I'm smelling tart cherries, either Merlot or Cabernet, and just a suggestion of the sweet bourbon. I'm tasting massively tart cherries, Merlot, and a touch of bourbon. The mouth is very viscous and smooth, which is very unique for a wild ale.	4.38
5598	Sang Noir	Full and barrely and lovely. Lacto tartness hides the booze beautifully. Blended such that neither the vinous nor the bourbon-y taste wins out. Closer to a classic Flanders Red than expected. Oh boy.	4.36
5599	Sang Noir	This beer pours a dark purple to brown with a small white head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of dark grapes, black cherry, port, bourbon, and cinnamon. It tastes of dark grape skins, black cherry, port, bourbon, and cinnamon. It has a full body, with good complexity. This is s great sour from Cascade.	4.64
5600	Sang Noir	Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a stemmed wine glass. Purchased in Attleboro MA.. Pours a muddy hazy brown body with an off white head that reduces to a single layer with some spotty lacing.. Aromas are lactic with dark fruits with some oak. Taste is pretty sour with cherries and dark fruits, lactic sourness, slightly acetic, sherry, definitely sweet, plums, brown sugar. Finish is tannic. Medium body with medium low carbonation.	4.25
5601	Sang Noir	Upon entering the pearly gates and making myself at home, just after I wake up and saunter to the kitchen for breakfast, I imagine this is what Miranda Kerr would be juicing me. A bouquet of super dark fruit and red wine for days are met by a perfect lip puckering punch. Does Raul say hallelujah for Sang Noir? I think he does.	4.41
5602	Sang Noir	Good God. I'm not even a big sour drinker but every time I put Cascade in my face I'm filled with joy. Had this minutes before A Cantillon Kriek. No contest, this wins.	4.6
5603	Sang Noir	Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a very thin carbonated head that goes away almost instantly. There is no head retention or lacing. Big sour aroma with wine and a lot of dark fruits. Big sour taste. Wine, raisins, plums. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation.	4.36
5604	Sang Noir	This was a huge beer, it was incredibly thick and heavy on the palate, which is why I knocked a few points off the feel, as it was way too heavy for a sour. That said, it was well executed. You can taste all of the elements involved. The spiced red ale base blends together well with the bourbon and wine barrels. The sour bite comes on strong with the finish.	4.15
5605	Sang Noir	"Not a sour guy
Bomber $27
Pours dark red little head, fizzy
Smells fruity
Tastes of wine, wood, and sour cherries, not getting the bourbon.
The sour is in the fruit which is good.
Thin mouthfeel.
Overall a very enjoyable sour and well put together."	4.31
5606	Sang Noir	On tap at Brewberry Bar in Paris, France. Poured in a 12.5cl tasting glass. Well well, the balance of this beer is amazing the wine notes and bourbon notes mellows quite well and go along the dark berries sourness of the ale with wonder. Amazing beer.	4.68
5607	Sang Noir	Dark garnet with a creamy, persistent tan-mauve blanket that lifts at the collar, leaving a bumpy ring of lace on the glass.. The nose, wow. Amazing, rich caramel. Deep, dark cherry. The peppery oak of bourbon brings vanilla and an almost fudgy, marshmallow aroma.. Taste is perfectly tart cherry with charred oak, spicy bourbon and a minimal sour sting paired with some heat and a rounding, smooth, creamy carbonation with a semi-dry, tingly finish.	4.33
5608	Sang Noir	"Bottle:
Pours a deep burgundy. Head has a lightly purple to red hue to the beige creamy froth, and provides a bunch of lacing.. Nose is sour with a vinegar and lemon aspect. Sour cherry comes secondarily, ahead of a light vanilla note. Bourbon isn’t really coming to me, though.. A light malt and tartness opens, but the sour (cherry to crab apple) leading, lightly vinegary notes come fast. These fade and a dark cherry gets a chance to be noticed. Warmth mellows the sourness and a semblance of cherry soda exists in the background. I’m thinking maybe a little vanilla from the barrel helps here, but the tartness still keeps a shroud over this flavor..  745 characters"	4.13
5609	Sang Noir	Pours murky reddish brown with no head. Hints of gold in the light.. The nose is complex cherry, and the taste follows, with black and red cherry, plum, grape, balsamic vinegar, and light caramel. The taste is pretty sour (7+/10), especially when chilled, but it opens up as it warms. Big cherry flavor. Subtle bourbon and vanilla.. The mouthfeel is slick but smooth. Borderline teeth-achingly sour until your palate adjusts, but reigned in by the barreling..  651 characters	4.49
5610	Sang Noir	Appearance - The beer brings to mind blood red wine.. Smell - The nose is rich in the vein of a red wine.. Taste - At The front is rich red wine, sour apple, A little spice, and the booze. The rich flavors carry towrd the back with a warm red grape sensation. Overall profile never seems to fade..  407 characters	4.74
5611	Sang Noir	750ml, caged and corked bottle (2015 Project, @9.9% ABV) - part of a few new Cascade offerings to recently arrive around here.. This beer pours a slightly hazy, dark ruby brown colour, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy tan head, which leaves some mountaintop snowpack lace around the glass as it quickly blows off.. It smells of sour cherries, vanilla-accented wet wood, musty red wine, grainy and bready pale malt, aged lemons, artisanal vinegar, and a further reduced brown sugar sweetness. The taste is incredibly tart lemon, cherry and blackberry fruity notes, gritty and bready caramel malt, red balsamic wine vinegar, a subtle barrel stave woodiness, crushed red grapes, and a mild earthiness that I cannot quite attribute to the presence of hops..  1,472 characters	4.22
5612	Sang Noir	Very nice. A LOT happening, but it comes together well. Cherry, oak, red grape, balsamic vinegar, blackberry, lemon, more. The bourbon is incredibly restrained, just a bit in the finish. Quite astringent. Fairly sour. A winner.	4.32
5613	Sang Noir	It looks like vinegar. It smells like FANCY vinegar - like the stuff from that store that only sells olive oil and vinegars from barrels at the mall. You take a sip - your tongue goes into shock, and your lips turn into a cat's @$$#*@&, But the taste turns, and suddenly it's good... Really good. You go back for another sip to make sure. Then another, and another. Pretty soon you're scouring liquor store shelves for it, but all you can find are their Apricot or Raspberry stuff. The guy at the liquor store tells you, 'it be like that'. I guess 'it do'.	5
5614	Sang Noir	"Wow!
Ok now for details lol
Love this sour ages in the red wine barrels. It is absolutely perfect for a hot summer day which is what I had it on today."	5
5615	Vicinity	Dated 6/19/19 on the bottom of the can, 6 weeks since brewing.. Pours nearly opaque pale straw in the glass with a finger of rocky white head. Nose of nectarine ice cream, mango, candied pineapple, crushed grains, slight black pepper, guava and a distant onion. Taste follows the nose with lots of sweet tropicals. Higher bitterness than normal for a Trillium smoothie with some decent drying. Medium+ sweetness and a low rolling carbonation leading to a soft medium body. A wonderful brew but nothing to freak out about. Maybe I've had too many Trillium brews.	4.34
5616	Vicinity	A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellowish with a half-finger of white head that settles quickly.. S: Tropical fruit salad - mango, pineapple, papaya and ripe melon.. T: Juicy ripe canteloupe. Papaya and mango. Ripe oranges & creamsicle. Sweeter tropical fruits dominate the overall impression..  390 characters	4.02
5617	Vicinity	Another home run NE IPA from Trillium. Copper orange and hazy, tropical fruits, piney, citrus on both he nose and the palate. Nicely balanced and extremely quaffable for the abv.	4.23
5618	Vicinity	"Look - creamy light yellow color slight head
Smell - orange pineapple mango scents
Taste - super fruity orange pineapple mango
Feel - creamy medium body
Overall - incredible"	4.66
5619	Vicinity	Vicinity pours a light, straw yellow with a bit of murk from the flaked wheat. No real head (old can?) or lacing present. The smell is big citrus with orange, grapefruit and pineapple with a hint of mango. The taste has a medium body over the palette with pineapple and a hint of grapefruit, slightly bitter finished with some alcohol.	4.51
5620	Vicinity	"L: dark orange, full pulp orange juice. Complete haze that poured thick with a white fluffy head that fades fast
S: sweet fruit, whole ripe mangos, pineapple and oranges. The Rhine peel is present an balanced
T: yum.. I love the sweet fruit forward and dank slight biter bite at the end that makes me immediately want another sip.
F: thick and creamy, while soft and smooth."	4.62
5621	Vicinity	"You might hate them or love them but this looks the NEIPA part nice bright haze with glow yellow orange .strong smells ripe tropical notes without the rotten notes .
Taste where it turns in the wrong direction over taken w more over ripe fruit muddled nothing stands out or layers mouth fell is average to a touch thin ..."	4.33
5622	Vicinity	"A: The beer is very cloudy whitish yellow in color, which becomes darker towards the bottom of the can. It poured with a half finger high bright white head that quickly died down, leaving lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of grapefruit are present in the nose along with notes of limes and pineapple.
T: The taste follows the smell and has more balanced flavors of pineapple and lime with hints of grapefruit pith in the finish. Only a slight amount of bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels medium-bodied and very juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This New England IPA is very juicy and really packs the in the hops in the smell and taste. I liked the combination of limes and pineapples in the taste.. Serving type: can"	4.28
5623	Vicinity	"Canned on Aug/09.
Drank on Oct/12.
Poured to a BrewDog stemmed glass.. A: Body is a vibrant mix of yellow and orange that's totally opaque. Head is minimal, existing only when pouring.
S: There's tons of hoppy grassy tones with a citric base that's even hard to explain due to the intensity of the hop aroma. It's too prominent actually.
T: Taste starts off so sweet, having hints of vanilla, orange, tangerine, mango, peach, even a bit of milk can be felt here. After this genius mix of flavours the beer ends with a perfect grassy hoppy tone that's very solid.
M: Body is medium to high. Carbonation is perfect. Alcohol is unnoticed. Bitterness is high. Generally speaking, this mouthfeel is genius.
O: This is some of the best Trillium beers I've had so far."	4.59
5624	Vicinity	Can. From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Really strong frutality and bitterness, with some milkshake ipa reminiscences. Good but didnt live up the hype, as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass	4.21
5625	Vicinity	This is a great NEIPA. Departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer. I appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off.	4.48
5626	Vicinity	Two day old growlette poured into a tulip glass.. L: Pours murky white golden with less than 1 finger of quickly dissipating white head that left minimal spotted lacing.. S: Great nose, very tropical. Plenty of orange and mango, more subtle notes of passionfruit, pineapple and papaya..  835 characters	4.49
5627	Vicinity	"Currently #185 in the Top 250 beers list. My first Trillium beer...I'm rather excited.. CAN: Acquired at Trillium. 1 pint formt with a minimalist white label and a standard pull-tab.. 8% ABV. ""Double IPA."".  3,038 characters"	3.4
5628	Vicinity	When I first cracked this, it was the first beer from Trillium that I had ever had. I have now come to think that Trillium is second in New England only to Hill Farmstead.	5
5629	Vicinity	Crisp and clean but with some floaters too! Nice tropical fruits up front give way to a solid bit of hoppy bitterness on the end. Refreshing and satisfying double here that doesnt taste like a double.	4.44
5630	Vicinity	Delicious. Smooth with tons of flavor. Fruity, hazy, with a great finish. Definitely not overdone with the alcohol content like some double IPAs have. To be honest surprised it’s a double IPA almost to smooth to be a double.	4.66
5631	Vicinity	Pours a golden peach with a fluffy fast dissipating head. Aroma is big on mango and pineapple with a piney crackery malt note. Flavor is tropical fruits, slightly bitter hops, and a soft malt backbone. Goes down smoothly with a crisp finish. A well crafted DIPA.	4.31
5632	Vicinity	Appearance: Arrives cloudy and goldenstraw colored with a frothy but modest head; decent retention and some clumps of lacing hang around. Smell: Tropical fruit elements of pineapple, starfruit, mango and tangerine. Taste: The dankness builds after the tropical fruit flavors emerge; pineapple, mango and starfruit forward, with orange and pithy tones developing, through the middle; crisp and hoppy, after the swallow and into the finish.  586 characters	4.35
5633	Vicinity	Pours Golden yellow, frothy head of foam and thin lace on the glass.. Lots of citrus on the nose with slight bitterness , hints of tropical mango. Really boozy as it warms.. Lots of hops upfront, nice and bitter. Citrus follows, tangerine and grapefruit. Light malt backbone..  315 characters	4.33
5634	Vicinity	This is an amazing beer! Could be the best I've had.. If this beer is not to your liking, than clearly you do not like NE style ipa period. Amazingly well crafted, and balanced. Honestly amaze balls!	4.96
5635	Vicinity	Canned 2/06/18. Consumed on 2/22/2018.. Incredibly cloudy look to this brew.. Citrus on the nose..  246 characters	4.52
5636	Vicinity	The citrusy, tropical, floral notes in this one makes for one of the best mouth feels in a DIPA that ive had. The balance between the sweetness from the malt bill and the hops combo is great. Galaxy, Citra and Colombus hops makes this extra juicy with a perfect thick haze.	4.53
5637	Vicinity	"Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.. 16 oz. Can
Canned On: 11/20/17. Poured into a Trillium glass a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger plus white head, which also leaves some pretty nice creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, malty, with a really nice citrus complex (oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, peaches, grapes), very nice diesel like. The taste is very nice, hoppy (really picking up on the Galaxy/Citra), malty, really nice citrus complex (oranges, grapefruit, tangerine, peaches, pineapple, grapes), really nice diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, another very tasty brew from Trillium. Addictive! Orange Julius! Glad I got a chance to try this. Thanks Bill!"	4.6
5638	Vicinity	"Serving: Can
Canned: Nov-20-2017 (Consumed Dec-21). 
Pours Trillium-looking with a skiff of scummy head with lackluster retention and no lacing. The aroma is of bright candied citrus and white bread with a little earthy hop body to balance. The flavor follows with clean lime zest and a peppery dry bitterness with a lot of nice earthy hops in the middle. No detectable alcohol, quick, fairly dry finish. A very solid IIPA but not crazy fruity or weird or anything."	4.3
5639	Vicinity	Look- Hazy golden straw. Slight tinge of translucency. Smell- Grape Juice that set out at room temp for a bit too long.A little bit wet earth. Nice funkiness to it. Taste- Similar to aroma. Digging it. Very hard to find a comparable. The after taste actually has a bit of the organic taste you get from eating green seedless grapes.  582 characters	4.5
5640	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	2018 Bottle.. Dark, viscous pour. As the beer fills the glass, formations of tan head rise and dance on top of the beer, settling into a small ring around the rim of the glass. After a few minutes it dissipates into a flat, black abyss.. Huge amounts of dark fruit and barrel influence to the nose of this beer. To compliment those notes of plum and molasses are solid undertones of bold, dark chocolate and black licorice. Subtleties of oak and vanilla emerge as the beer continues to warm..  1,249 characters	4.61
5641	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Thanks to a local for swapping fluids with me & knocking a long, long time want off my list. 375ML classic Jackie O’s bottle while watching Merle die & celebrating another Twins win.. Inky black with no rise even given a hard pour. The nose is barrel & a sweetness that leans hard into molasses & chocolate. The unholy trinity.. Appervation could be presented as a Black Tuesday variation & I wouldn’t bat an eye. The mouthfeel is decadent AF, as the kids say, thicker than grandma’s fudge batter & almost as appealing. Bourbon booms out of the glass, along with most of the malts harvested in 2017. Sweet, dripping sweet, oak, maple, fudge, black silk, black licorice. No booziness present except when I stood up to go relieve myself. Bed is two flights of stairs away..  986 characters	4.12
5642	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	A: Thick black pour with elusive mocha-brown highlights, and a head with minimal characteristics: formation, retention, lacing. S: Molasses, liquorice, bourbon-drenched dark fruit concentrations with a vinous touch: An aroma of depth given the array of milk chocolate, oaked nutty malts, cocoa powder, caramel swirl, burned char, leather, subdued coconut. T: Lots of minute workings to become deep-rooted in: the silky sharp chocolate, tricky layers of dark fruit, smoky tobacco, rich caramel, singed toffee, roasted walnuts, baked vanilla espresso, a touch of maple fudge.  1,071 characters	4.21
5643	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	I drove 2 hours each way and stood in line 2 hours to buy this beer. The samples I had on tap while in line were fantastic. However, the beer in the bottles is not the same beer. I get a stale, metallic taste. Jackie O's has struggled with their bottling line the past two years. They still have work to do.	3.83
5644	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	375 ml bottle into snifter, 2018 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a minimal spotty lace cap. Minimal lacing with some clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Very mild herbal/roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark bread, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, light smoke/char/pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Mildly increasing warmth of 13.5%, with no barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV; with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Insanely rich malt complexity, with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels. A highly amazing offering, and top tier style example as expected.	4.35
5645	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Tasted from bottle and on draft. Pours jet black with dark brown head. Aroma of bourbon, molasses, cocoa. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, molasses, vanilla and bourbon. Huge and incredible beer.	4.85
5646	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	2018 release.. A: Pours an inky black with a smattering of tan head.. S: Vanilla, a bit of strong ethanol, dry oak, bourbon, dark chocolate, a hint of plum, light roastiness and coffee..  629 characters	4.35
5647	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Very dark appearance with minimal head. Aroma is a very pleasant slightly sweet bourbon and caramel. Taste is also a slightly sweet bourbon that is a perfect blend with minimal alcohol taste.	4.75
5648	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Thick stout with oily body, deep bourbon notes and plenty of roasty Malta to make sure the base beer doesn’t get lost.. There’s a not so subtle umami flavor with it, but it’s not off-putting. Really excellent.	4.78
5649	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin khaki head that dissipates immediately. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of bourbon, brownie batter, baker’s chocolate, and chocolate syrup. It tastes of brownie batter, chocolate syrup, Oreo, with a strong bourbon kick. It is full and complex, but still drinkable. This is an excellent ba stout.	4.64
5650	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Slap a Toppling Goliath label on this and all of a sudden it would be a perfect 5 haha.. Seriously though, this is perfection at its most subtle. This beer is the perfect rendition of what a regular non adjunct beer should be. This is a true must for a REAL beer appreciation fan who doesn't need fancy pastry gimmicks to make an amazing brew. Great job	4.67
5651	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	375ml bottle, undated, 2017 release, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 10.21.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a jet black color, inky, oily, sludgy and viscous with a thin head, khaki colored with no retention nor lace. The aroma is fantastic, tons of chocolate, bittersweet but rich with a strong barrel character, lots of bourbon, charred oak and toffee with some molasses and caramel and strong roasted grains with a warm alcohol heat. The flavors are excellent, rich chocolate, super smooth and decadent with a very intense barrel expression, loads of bourbon, spicy and bringing out some caramel and vanilla with a strong charred oak flavor, roasted grain, light molasses and toffee with some stone fruits and licorice. The mouthfeel is perfect, sludge, heavy body that is coating and smooth with a chewy and thick full finish.. Verdict: An exceptional barrel aged stout from Jackie O's and Side Project. It's got everything a barrel aged stout needs to have, a thick body, a complex and delicate flavor profile weaving chocolate, bourbon, oak, and stone fruits into a beautiful product that doesn't need to rely on any adjuncts. Just a stunner of a beer.	4.62
5652	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	So there were, what, four or five weeks on Beer Advocate where everyone was posting trades for Appervation, right? I sure hope all of those traders were happy with what they received. I ended up receiving my bottle in a slightly unplanned way - I hadn't been in to the hype, but was still pleased to locate and try a bottle.. But, cautious. I was skeptical of the hype and didn't want to be disappointed. I've been hurt too many times in the past!. I made the mistake of giving this one a shot when it was still too cold. The carbonation was practically non-existent - only the tiniest little foaming tipped me off that the bottle hadn't gone bad. Relief! The alcohol notes are definitely a bit unpleasant when the beer is still cold - it's probably the worst example I've found recently of how stouts are very temperature-sensitive. But, after it warms up - the chocolate and bourbon come alive. The alcohol remains strongly in the nose, taste, and mouth feel, but the flavors open up wonderfully..  1,134 characters	4.5
5653	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	L - Snifter pour from draft. Inky black. Thin head.. S - absurd amounts of bourbon and dark fruit. Vanille. Creme brulee. Carmelized sugar.. T - sticky sweet. Loads of vanilla toffee and burnt sugat. Faint char..  294 characters	4.58
5654	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	375ml bottle poured into a snifter. A- pours a deep black color with a one-finger khaki colored head that reduces to a ring around the edge. S- smells of smoky charred malt, dark chocolate, espresso, fudge brownies & caramel. Plenty of barrel character, including wet oak, bourbon, vanilla & coconut.  798 characters	4.6
5655	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	375 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of nutty malts, oak, bourbon, chocolate. Tastes much better. Chocolate cut by oak and licorice. Bourbon. It’s sweet, but it has a really nice dark fruit complexity in the back end. Finish is charred oak. Heavy, pretty sweet. Excellent flavor, but it’s pretty alcoholic.	4.08
5656	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	375ml bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a dark black body, oily, with a bit of hulky leg, one finger offwhite head, short retention, bits of lacing. Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, a bit of nuttiness, slight roast, earth, a bit of espresso. Flavour is an unholy mix of bourbon, chocolate fudge, slight vanillin, brownie batter, touch of almond and roast, mildly earthy finish. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, slightly lower carbonation than would be expected. Overall, an excellent barrel-aged imperial stout that hides its 15% abv extremely well. Holy cow.	4.43
5657	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Pours dark and thick. Small dark khaki head with some fine lacing. Big aroma. Caramel, roasted malt, and bourbon. More caramel on the tongue with chocolate as well. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Thick and rich on the tongue. A bit creamy with a nice roasty feel. Alcohol is well hidden for 15%. Great beer. Would never believe the abv.	4.76
5658	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Appervation tastes a lot like Derivation, with layers of chocolate goodness and roastiness, though it is a little light on the barrel and thin on the mouthfeel. Overall, it feels like a not-so-fully developed Derivation.	4.48
5659	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Smell: this super barrel forward huge oak and bourbon. Vanilla toasted coconut. Rich milk chocolate dark chocolate some dark fruit as well. Literally smells like a 3 year old aged BCBS.. Taste: initially this just smacks you in the face with bourbon and barrel notes. Smooth bourbon and oak upfront middle of the mouth big mix of rich milk and dark chocolate vanilla some dark cherry in the finish you get more of that dark cherry and dark fruit notes figs raisin that mix with more of that smooth bourbon and oak flavor. The finish is in your face with booze soaked dark fruits. I mean the whole beer is in your face. This taste so much like bourbon County but even a little more intense and in your face.. Feel: it's full bodied, rich and silky smooth on the tongue. Medium high amount of alcohol heat but it works. This is a mans beer sip and enjoy!.  1,092 characters	4.9
5660	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	"L: pours dark brown like cola without the fizz. Pitch black in he glass with a film of head that fades the the rim fast.
S: big brownie fudge and dark chocolate with smooth bourbon. I wish the bourbon was bigger on the nose, but still an aweome aroma.
T: oh yeah! This is delicious!! The bourbon is bigger in the taste thankfully and still has tons of fudge.
F: full and chewy! A bit less carbonation would make this smoother.
O: not derivation.. but also not near derivation price."	4.6
5661	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	"L - Pitch black, minimal foam, the only signs of carb are leaning against the edges of the glass, espresso brown in color.
S - Smells of chocolate dipped raisins
T - more chocolate than raisin. Charred oak mixes with a nice sweet vanilla. Still a lingering dark fruit end with a bigger expression of ris than expected, but I dig.
F - it's thick, viscous and beautiful but the charred chocolate is making it seem a bit on the ashy-side. not overdone, but presenting itself more and more.
O - I really enjoyed this, actually reminds me of the recent release of Assassin, the extra long aging (14 months!) in barrels really brought out some awesome complexities. I'm stoked to be able to revisit this thing down the road, scoop it up now!"	4.49
5662	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	"L: Dark and thick mocha hues with an ample sandy head
S: Nice barrel notes, graham cracker, chocolate syrup, and brownies
T: Complex flavor profile led by the depth of the oatmeal stout with layers of fudge, dark chocolate, and a touch of vanilla
F: Thick and viscous with a touch of carb
O: I thoroughly enjoyed this one - a great collab by two standout breweries. I'm a bit puzzled by some of the reviews I've seen for this one, but a lot of it reeks of trader's remorse. In any event, I tried to taste the beer on its own merits and when viewed through that lens I felt it was a solid, thick, flavorful, bold, boozy, and enjoyable stout. For me, Appervation really earned its stripes."	4.72
5663	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Pours black with small brown head. Smells of typical BA stout. Tastes like a little bigger Dark Apparition...don't really know what else to say other than I'm glad they scammed the public into thinking this was even remotely close to DERIVATION. Bummed I traded a good beer for this :-/	3.31
5664	Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation	Stark black with a minimal mocha head that can actually be swirled to a thicker dense blanket that's mesmerizing to look at.. Smell is a rich blend of chocolatey walnut and nougat with waxy oak that's a little musty and peppery. Hints of brownie and Tootsie Roll follow.. Taste starts sweet and chocolately with a maple-coconut syrup undertone, and an exceptionally roasty, almost umami overtone. There's plenty of oaky wood, with sticky raisin and date, but a tongue numbing heat builds with a bitter ashy char in the finish..  966 characters	4.07
5665	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral coffee notes with some black chocolate note and some subtle bourbon notes. Taste is a mix of floral coffee notes with light residual sugar notes, some chocolate notes with some bourbon notes with light vanilla notes also perceptible. Body is full with good carbonation and no real apparent alcohol notes. Superb coffee based imperial stout with some light and well-balanced bourbon notes.	4.25
5666	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Back as pitch with a thin and light tan head, wonderfully rich coffee on the nose, less bourbon than typical for the brewery but still added to the otherwise simplistic brew. This is in my top two or three for certain though as what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in execution and refinement!	4.67
5667	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Coffee bomb... nice, smooth coffee though, not overly bitter. Chocolate notes and some bourbon on the finish. When it finally hits room temp it’s all coffee	4.53
5668	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Really dark brown color with mocha head. Aroma has nice bourbon, cacao, caramel, fudge and a hint of sweetened coffee. Taste has fresh ground coffee, well integrated bourbon, toffee and fudge. Bitter, roasty finish with lingering caramel. Medium plus body, medium carbonation, soft on the palate. A really well made, tasty, coffee stout.	4.65
5669	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Dark dark brown, fairly opaque. Thin mocha head settles into a ring around my glass with a central floating island.. Aroma is black coffee, sweet vanilla bean, boozy bourbon barrel.. Bitter dark coffee, sweet vanilla bourbon barrel, roasted dark malt. Bittersweet baking cocoa..  428 characters	4.27
5670	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	This one pours a pretty dark black, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing.. This smells like fruity and roasty coffee- the coffee is a strong aroma, but it doesn't completely dominate here. There's caramel, oak, bourbon, and tons of chocolate.. The coffee flavor in this is super nice, and well integrated into a superior base beer. There's lots of fudgy chocolate, with vanilla and caramel providing a nice hint of sweetness, and lots of dark fruit and a slightly smokey flavor from the coffee. The barrel character is also killer here, with lots of not-too-boozy bourbon flavor and a hint of oak..  876 characters	4.51
5671	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Pours black with one finger of khaki head that recedes to a thin collar with minimal lacing. Smell is mostly dark chocolate and bourbon with hints of vanilla and dark roasty coffee.. Taste is a well balanced blend of dark roasted malts, cocoa, hazelnut, espresso, and smooth bourbon. Very nice layering of flavors that hit all the right notes for the style.. Body is slick and silky smooth, but I find myself wishing it was just a bit more full and chewy. As great as the flavor is, I wish it hung on the palate a little longer..  658 characters	4.74
5672	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	375 at Hoppin Frog for $13++ during HH.. Pitch dark, thick ring. Nice dark roast nose with some nuttiness, a bit stale though. Great flavors, but wayyy too thin. Chocolate and dark fruit dominate and chocolate lingers. Still, not quite fudgey like I want. A tad over rated imo.	4.23
5673	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	2017 vintage.. A: Pours black with a cap of espresso-like tan head that recedes to a razor-thin ring. Pretty good retention for the sparse head that’s there.. S: Dark roast coffee, a bit of baker’s spice, a good kick of dark chocolate and vanilla, with a light bourbon accent providing additional complexity..  954 characters	4.58
5674	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee, which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing, but in reality, is unique as can be, more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before, which is a large sample size for sure. the coffee here is so fresh, earthy, and rich. its roasted like crazy, with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts, which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle, its all dry and roasty, near black, with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon, which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness, but its not from grain. it almost tastes like an ice beer, like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors, the dark malt here is really deep, and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through. there is a lot of charred oak on this, a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front, and lots more chocolate. the whiskey is pretty strong here too, but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain. rich vanilla and maple notes in it, and just a little warming alcohol. this is amazingly complex and delicious, a hell of a breakfast beer, and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery! this is one of the best of its kind!	4.5
5675	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Got this in a trade last winter and have been saving it for my birthday. Worth. The. Wait! Wow! Perfect BBA Stout. The bourbon is present but not overwhelming. Wish I had more than just this one!	4.63
5676	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"375mL 2017 edition poured into a snifter
A: Pitch black with a thin head that lingers
S: Freshly brewed espresso, cocoa, vanilla, roasted malt, some toffee/molasses... very full and complex
T: Matches the nose note for note. Just tons going on, all of it delicious. Coffee up front followed by all the complexities of a well made barrel aged stout
M: Full-bodied, big without being boozy
O: This is one to sip slowly and savor. Just everything about it is well-made, completely worthy of the outstanding rating it has"	4.45
5677	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"From the shorty bottle in a snifter via the brewery. This beast of a stout pours
a deep obsidian with a nice brown head of brown foam that subsides to a thick ring,
thin pool, and showcases nice light lacing. Nose of coffee, dark cocoa fudge, vanilla,
heavy bourbon, heavy oak, and moderately heavy char. Flavors follow but surpass with
presentation of bourbon and heavy char awash in heavy oak notes with moderate vanilla
and heavy coffee with char and crème brûlée brown sugar notes on the rear. Excellent mouth feel;
full body, slick, coating, rich, and warming with low carbonation and a touch of raisin bourbon note
on the rear with warmth. Overall, a FANTASTIC stout that was even better on tap and worthy of the
name Jackie O's.. Cheers"	4.49
5678	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Pours a jet black with a thin deep brown foam head. Nose is of wet coffee grounds, molasses and burnt malt. Taste is extreamly coffee forward. Dark roast black, no cream no sugar. Nice sweet bourbon kick that cuts through the coffee. Wood, toasted dark malts, light vanilla and caramel present. A little thin on body, watered down. Still tho a very good stout. If you like your coffee dark. You'll dig this.	4.5
5679	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Poured out jet black, thin tan head on top settling into a ring around the glass. The smell is of molasses, not much coffee but it smells very good regardless. The taste is sweet again not a ton of coffee but definite chocolate in there with some caramel in there too. The feel is a little thinner than expected. Overall a very good stout.	4.28
5680	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"poured from a 375ml bottle into a Foam snifter
2017 bottle
pours a dark brown color with a nice 2 finger tan head that hung around for a while. Lots of chocolate on the nose, like smellinga warm cup of fudge. The taste is a blast of coffee with a creamy fudgie lingering after taste. An amazing coffee stout. Will have to grab more when possible!"	4.59
5681	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	375ml bottle, 2016 vintage, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 4.11.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a nice jet black color, very oily and inky and viscous with a finger of tan head, good retention and spotted lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of coffee, smooth roast profile, rich and inviting with a hint of nice acidity, plenty of dark grain and bittersweet chocolate with soft bourbon a touch of oaky barrel and some strong molasses character. The flavors are good, lots of chocolate and smooth barrel character up front, supportive coffee bean, with some nice richness but also some good counterbalancing fruit flavors and light acidity, molasses and alcohol clean up the finish. The mouthfeel is good, very coating, massively huge body, viscous and thick, chewy almost with a smooth finish.. Verdict: A very nice beer from Jackie O's. Smooth, rich, excellent expression from the coffee. I don't love the molasses flavor I keep getting and it's a hint on the warm and boozy side, but small knocks aside, this was an extremely worthy beer.	4.13
5682	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	2015 bottle poured into a voodoo teku. Drank at 51 degrees.. L - pours dark, dark, dark brown. Very frothy light brown with hues of red. Awesome sticky lacing.. S - as soon as I cracked it I was hit with bourbon and coffee from an arms length away. Bringing it closer theres the signa ture jackie o's massive amounts of bourbon. The coffee is prominent but not in your face. Loads of vanilla and carmelized sugar. The sweetness is very intense..  916 characters	4.3
5683	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	12 fl oz bottle sealed with pressure cap.. poured into Spiegelau tulip.. Appearance: opaque black body. Medium brown head that pour two fingers tall at cellar temperature. Head has nice staying power and remains a thick cap for almost the entire drink. Plenty of creamy sticky lacing left behind as the head slowly recedes..  1,285 characters	4.46
5684	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"L: pours thin and black with a small head that lingers.
S: coffee upfront, sweetness from he barrel brings maple notes. The barrel is almost as present as the coffee and is very nice, but this overall lacks a huge aroma.
T: that's a great mix of barrel and coffee. Very balanced between the two with both flavors popping.
F: medium thickness and creamy but not that coating."	4.41
5685	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"Received from a close Ohio friend. Poured and tasted the first few sips at 45 degrees. Continued to drink as it warmed to room temperature.. Look - Dark black in a snifter with not much head even somewhat aggressively poured.
Smell - Upfront bourbon with notes of oak, vanilla and coffee.
Taste - The bourbon, coffe, vanilla and oak tastes resemble the smell and play nicely together
Feel - Carbonation as expected for the style. Extremely smooth
Overall - A well put together offering from Jackie O's"	4.49
5686	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"Bottle:
Had this a few Sundays ago, combining my notes with this tasting:
A mocha head of about a finger tops the body that has a distinct absence of color. It poured like a thin oil from the bottle, and a not very vigorous pour generated that creamy head. The light tan foam doesn't leave, and suspends larger bubbles in its creaminess.. A good whiff yields a combined coffee, vanilla, chocolate scent. I recall a little more coffee from a few weeks back, but it might be memory or environment more than it fading. In both cases, it comes together leaning towards a chocolate brownie. There's a light bitter note that could be dark roast coffee or a hint of charred malt.. Feel is a bit more oily today, versus the smooth, creamy feel I got a couple weeks back. The vanilla I got before is not as present up front, but the bourbon and roasted notes come out up front. The coffee forms in the mid-taste, filling out the body a bit and leading to that chocolate brownie like impression overall. In my original notes, I had a light tang and dryness from the barrel grabbing the edges by the end. In this sitting, I am getting some of the dryness, but not so much the barrel. Instead I am getting a light oily nutty aspect. Overall, though, it is still a dark chocolate cocoa impression. What I do get, with warmth, is the coffee making subtle inroads into the chocolate taste..  1,739 characters"	4.58
5687	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	"Received from @SomethingClever – Thanks Dave!
Undated bottle (Other than 2016) stored at 42 degrees. Served at 50 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Aroma – coffee – no bourbon, no barrel. It does fade as the brew warms in my glass.
Head small (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive pour), tan, medium density and average retention, diminishing to a four mm ring of tiny to small bubbles and a thin partial layer.
Lacing – none.
Body – dark brown/black, opaque.
Flavor – wow! Coffee with stout added. Initially a little bourbon comes through, but when it warms on my tongue, the barrel and the alcohol become very noticeable. There is also a little of the char from the barrel present which contributes heavily to the aftertaste. No hops, no diacetyl.
Palate – medium, creamy, lively carbonation.. Interesting beer – quite unlike any prior coffee BBA stout I’ve ever had. This has more depth of taste than most, once you get past that initial blast of coffee. This grows on me with each swallow.. Appearance – 4, Aroma 3.75, Flavor 4.5, Palate 4, Overall 4.25."	4.19
5688	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	Appearance - Pours black with nice tight tan head.. Aroma - Roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and oak. There are also hints of cinnamon and spices. All of the aromas are so subtle but you can pick everyone out.. Taste - Lots of ground coffee, oak and bourbon. I am also getting some spices, vanilla and cocoa. The flavors are really well balanced in this beer..  547 characters	4.66
5689	Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground	2016 vintage, poured into a tulip. Big time coffee on the nose and taste, followed by oak and bourbon. A bit thinner and boozier than expected but enjoyable overall.	4.46
5690	Nelson	Hazy golden body, nice white head. Very citrusy aroma with some pine resin. Salty-bitter. Maybe it because I just exposed the the intense flavors of a Napa Parabola, but this tastes very watered down. Flavor: a very 2 dimensional citrus & pine resin. Feel: thin , good carbonation. Overall, I try to be fair with IPA’s but this one doesn’t do anything fir me.	3.73
5691	Nelson	Golden straw. You can really smell the malt bill in this beer which is really supportive of the hops. Hops don't give off a ton of nose but they do taste of pine and grapefruit rind. Mouthfeel is great. The rye really finishes clean.	4.34
5692	Nelson	"A: Light hazy gold with rich white foamy head and moderate lacing.
N: Citrus, pine, grapefruit, and soapy notes.
T: Big grapefruit hit with some other citrus mixed in, light tropical notes, light bitterness and a soapy finish.
M: Light to medium with mild dryness.
O: A really solid IPA, smooth but light bitterness make this a well rounded beer."	4.35
5693	Nelson	Quite enjoyable IPA at Industry! Great citrus aroma, bit of a bite on the tongue, sweet taste, yet delicious and refreshing. Overall a yummy drinkable IPA with Dave!	4.05
5694	Nelson	Soft golden and hazy with moderate carbonation and a finger of off white head.. Smells of real dank, earthy citrus, like hop oil. Almost like a gueuze, with a gravel like scent.. The taste follows the nose with the really unique, hop resin, gravel, asphalt, earthy, stone like quality which is dank and has a hint of citrus, but isn't really fruity..  698 characters	4.17
5695	Nelson	"LOOKS: A hazy, burnt lemon with a finger of white foam that slowly fades to a ring. Fair lacing down the glass.
AROMA: Big pineapple and mango with a nice cracker bread malt.
TASTE: Ditto for the flavor, and some lemon drops, as well.
FEEL: Well carbonated, medium body, and dry.
OA: Very nice!"	4.45
5696	Nelson	Pours out a cloudy straw color. The head is off-white with moderate retention. Lacing is moderate as well.. The nose full of ripe pineapple and sweet orange. It has a mild orange zest bitterness to it for some balance. Reminds me of a fruit juice blend. The aroma is very strong on is one. Very good.. Very juicy. Tons of tropical fruit with a mild piney bitterness. Its also has a slight earthy quality to it. Its very well balance and tasty. The 7% abv is undetectable..  577 characters	4.41
5697	Nelson	Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks.. Appearance (4.0): Two fingers of bone white, fluffy foam rise off of the pour, capping a modestly hazy, glowing yellow-golden body. The head dies down slowly, leaving a pock-marked cap and concentric collars of delicate lacing linked to the beer with light, tight, lacy webs. The lacing doesn’t stick around forever, but the overall impression is quite pretty while it’s there.. Smell (4.5): Navel orange zest and alphonso mango flesh mix with lightly peppery, spicy rye that shakes off a bit of dusty straw as it wafts into your nostrils. Bright, grassy notes, underripe pineapple, and passionfruit rind mix together to make a slightly bracing, refreshing tropical mélange that’s never sweet and cloying (as much as I love those sweet, juicy aromas of some contemporary (D)IPAs). As it opens up, oodles of passionfruit and gooseberry come out. Classic Nelson Sauvin, boosted by the spicy earth of rye, which adds a nice depth off of which the hops can play out in their full expression..  3,261 characters	4.37
5698	Nelson	Picked up a few dry cases at, wait for it...Total Wine..Huh? yep, Total had 4 cases on hand and I helped myself to all of them. Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can. Hopefully New Zeland will cut loose enough Nelson hops for Beachwood BBQ to put Alpha Supreme back on the menu, we can only hope.	4.26
5699	Nelson	Bottled 9/5/18, consumed 9/22/18. Doesn't compared to before, but this is a good IPA, Nelson hop aroma and taste very prominently featured. A bit rough on the feel.	4.23
5700	Nelson	"Poured into a hybrid glass from a 12oz bottle. A - A hazy deep golden straw, with half finger foamy white head and some nice sugar legs. S - A really nice balance of sugar, hops and a slight dry. Pine, pineapple and grapefruit abound! Clean water, lots of sweet malt/grain and just a hint of dry to ""git 'er done"", peach, some nice earthy and sweet yeast notes, floral with a slight dry earth hop and loving the nearly perfect booze..  1,362 characters"	4.6
5701	Nelson	It's a light gold color. The appearance is not representative of the overall huge flavor it has. The smell is fresh like orange juice and very piney. The taste is super refreshing and light and very flavorful and the ending notes are exceptionally loaded with fresh hops. It's very high on the drinkability scale. IT's an amazing beer in the IPA category.	4.63
5702	Nelson	Grunt fill from Albertsons. Bright golden pour, milky, fluffy head fades fast. Fruity, flowery aroma, mild dank notes. More funk and fruit in the taste, drying bitterness. Sweet and bitter.	3.81
5703	Nelson	Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive 2 inch head on draft. Leaves loads of lace.. Smell is tangerine, pine resin, guava, and grapefruit.. Taste follows tangerine, pine, guava, and grapefruit..  391 characters	4.29
5704	Nelson	Amazing beer, my all time favorite.. So cloudy and sweet, like citrus dew drops landing on your tongue after a tropical rainstorm. Life changing.. Near, if not perfect beer. Near, rather than perfect due to inconsistency and availability. Try it at the brewery a few times and you’ll see what I mean about consistency. Have some at Green Flash if you want to mingle with tourists and amateurs. Find it bottled and text me so I can come have some with you you...you’re about to drink bottled unicorn nectar.	4.93
5705	Nelson	had this on tap. beautiful pour, way hazier than i would have thought - completely opaque. a dense bright white head hangs around for a while and leaves tons of lace. on nose is pine, dankness, grapefruit, citrus peel. this mostly follows on the palate, but there is also a white grape note and a super pithy herbaceous character. some citrus, lemon, grapefruit, orange, showing up as well. good malt presence throughout, and a nice hit of mellow spice from the rye. mouthfeel is on point! this was an absolute pleasure to drink after having so many hazed NE beers - great balance between juicy citrus notes, danky pine and green character, and that touch of spice from the rye. excellent brew!	4.67
5706	Nelson	4/14/17...pours pale gold, a little hazy, but able to see through. Dry wine nose, very faint. Crisp dark fruity flavor. White wine throughout. Pretty tasty.	3.72
5707	Nelson	Classic old-school hoppy IPA. Bitter, sure, but the right amount of bitterness - not overwhelming. Quenching when guzzled. A tasty brew. Lucky to get it on tap.	3.75
5708	Nelson	Had it on draft in a English pint. Hazy bright yellow with a thick, foamy head and great lacing. The smell is intensely citrus. The taste is strong grapefruit and orange, also prominent pine and hoppy bitterness. A very flavorful beer!	4.33
5709	Nelson	Amber appearance with significant white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is fruit with a touch of citrus and rye. Taste is also a fruit with a touch of citrus and a prominent rye.	4.17
5710	Nelson	On tap at Growler USA in Phoenix. Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Pungent aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Piney.	4.24
5711	Nelson	Look: It pours golden with a white head that has moderate head retention. It is fairly clear.. Smell: There are aromas of rye, tropical fruit, and pineapple.. Taste: The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor. In addition the flavors are highlighted by some citrus and grapefruit..  594 characters	4.28
5712	Nelson	Poured from a howler on the day it was tapped. A vigorous pour produces a thick, creamy, light tan, two finger head on top of an orangish tan, slightly opaque beer. The smell knocks you over with fresh citrus and woody/piney hops. There is also a spiciness to it. The taste is bitter hops resin, and a woody, floral spice. The citrus comes through less on the taste than in the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Overall a great beer I'm happy I had the chance to try. It's a unique flavor.	4.25
5713	Nelson	Love love love Nelson hops so I have been trying to get this for a while. Worth the wait. It can stand there with most northeast IPA's. Wish it was more readily available in my area!	4.63
5714	Nelson	One of the first beers I ever had from Alpine. They are probably over all my favorite west coast brewery for hops right now. Super hoppy super smooth too. Nice mix of rye and citrus hops going on with this.	4.57
5715	Peche 'n Brett	A- 1.5 inch creamy head that holds well; cloudy.. S- bread, yeast, apple juice with hints of citrus.. T - Sour fruits, orange, yeast..  238 characters	4.4
5716	Peche 'n Brett	2016 vintage - drank on 4/26/2019. A ton of peach and fairly funky - lots of brett character. Very good, though the body and mouth feel leaves something to be desired.	4.25
5717	Peche 'n Brett	Excellent Sour from Oregon. Tons of peaches add nuance, some funk, but not overbearing sourness. Considering how high of an ABV this beer is, the booze is masked to perfection with a smooth finish asking for another sip. I have had it at a Chicago bar (Links Taproom) and also picked up a bottle at the Beer Temple.	4.59
5718	Peche 'n Brett	"Bottle Date: best by August 2022
Palate Contaminants: none. Color is light gold. Opaque glow. Fair amount of fine head.. The smell has both citrus acidity and some lactic element. The peach blends well with that acidity. It doesn't hang around as long as I'd like..  803 characters"	4.18
5719	Peche 'n Brett	"L : Generic golden amber color.
S: Strongest smell of a beer. Leaks out immediately after I open it. The peaches roam far.
T: The union of peach and brett. The peach doesn't overpower the brett but still retains itself in the mix of brett and oak.
F: Light fizz with peaches.
O: Unique brett fusion with peaches. Good stuff."	4.87
5720	Peche 'n Brett	Golden and hazy with loads of fast rising carbonation, and a half finger of white head.. Smells very Brett forward. Funky, sour lambic qualities, earthy, dusty brewery filled with cobwebs that remind me of Cantillon. Oak barrel as well. There is a light fruitiness, perhaps peach but not yet distinguishable. Macaroni and a lactic milk like quality.. Tastes of sour and slightly sweet, not bone dry. All the Brett, earthy, dusty lambic and oak come through, and it ends with fermenting fruit..  723 characters	4.44
5721	Peche 'n Brett	"One of the 14 beers we have had in one session of some bad-ass tasting brew.
Very nice one. The peaches bring a nice fruity freshness. The brett are a bit acetic but not overly. The whole thing is balanced, tasty and damn drinkable"	4.57
5722	Peche 'n Brett	First time I had this it changed my perspective of fruited American sours. Explosive peach juice and perfect lactic balance. THe 2017 has been overtaken by brett.	3.9
5723	Peche 'n Brett	"L -- Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy straw body with practically no head produced with even a well aerated pour. Looks like cider
S -- Peach, jasmine, green apple jolly rancher, watermelon, bretty sourness, dryer sheets. Aromas don't pop out of the glass but are very nuanced and pleasant
T -- The peach really shines here and offsets the moderate (definitely not overbearing) tartness that is present. Also getting raspberry, oaky tannins, musky perfume, floral, quince, sour apple
F -- Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Nice and lively, an excellent warm weather beer. No bitterness and the 10% ABV is absolutely undetectable. Someone could tell me this is 5% -- hell, even 3.5% -- and I'd believe them.
O -- One of the best wild saisons I've had to date. The peach addition really brings everything together nicely. Wish it weren't $20/750ml, but it's worth it for special occasions.. 91/100"	4.54
5724	Peche 'n Brett	Very hard to believe this one is 10%. Super drinkable for that ABV. Nose is a rush of lactic sourness and peachy stonefruit. Definitely a tart one but not overly so. I'd grab more of these if it weren't super expensive.	4.44
5725	Peche 'n Brett	"Fresh batch (couldn't read date, but was just distro'ed). Pours a pale straw with haze
Strong brett on the nose, with faint stonefruit, but peach is lost in the background
Brett is dominant, not much else makes it through except alcohol heat on the finish
Light spritz with good carb, body hides its ABV well. Overall a nice beer, but not worth the $27 a bottle."	3.62
5726	Peche 'n Brett	Tried from the cellar at Niche in Geneva. Had been trying to find a bottle for many years, and the hunt was worth it! First a warning, this beer is dangerous, it tastes so light and peachy, along with signature saison yeast character, that the 10 percent abv is undetectable! So smooth yet has a strong saison presence in the mouthfeel. Bit of an aftertaste of multivitamin with the peach but not in a bad way. Very balanced, would be the perfect beer for a sunny picnic in July.	4.58
5727	Peche 'n Brett	Hazy gold-amber with a large, airy white foam leaving a layer of chunky lace and settling quickly to a bubbly matt and round collar.. Smell certainly showcases brett, which is slightly funky of nutty cheese, but in a nice, measured and balanced way, allowing room for spicy oak and nice, fresh peach and green apple brightness.. Taste is very peachy--as though it is candied, or like a bright and juicy, freshly made pie filling before being cooked--with pear, spice from the oak and slightly funk cheese..  599 characters	4.12
5728	Peche 'n Brett	Very nice beer. Carb complemented the beer well and it was very refreshing. The star of the show was clearly the peaches. They came through very well and worked excellent with the base beer	4.43
5729	Peche 'n Brett	Bought for me by a friend, great find in Connecticut! Not overly peachy. Not as carbonated as I was expecting. Gets better with each sip. Would gladly drink anytime!	4.5
5730	Peche 'n Brett	hazy-dark-golden appearance w/ a 1/4 glass of bubbly head. Peach funk scent w/ the slightest sting of acidity. flavor wise..probably the most balanced on the tart/funk spectrum that I've ever had w/ a full dose of peach to boot. This bitch squats a mouthfeel-full rack to parallel. Heavily enjoying this sipper on a mildly pleasant early fall New England Friday afternoon.	4.46
5731	Peche 'n Brett	"Look: Orange with big fluffy head. High carbonation.
Smell: Peach, brett, oak, and pine,
Taste: Peach, pear, oak, slight funk, and pine.
Mouthfeel: Light and refreshing.
Overall: A good saison, that drinks way below its abv."	4.21
5732	Peche 'n Brett	2017 batch drank on 7/2/2017. looks like a hazy IPA almost. heavy saison that's pretty subtle and balanced in flavors. the peach is nice and it wasn't sour hardly at all. a tad boozy, but for 10% it was pretty well hidden. glad i have another one to put some age on.	4.27
5733	Peche 'n Brett	Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.. Pours an amber hazy body with a big three finger frothy head that reduces slowly to leave heavy lacing and good retention.. Aromas are heavy peaches, tart lactic. On the tongue is dry peaches sitting on a pretty heavy malt backbone, slightly bitter and hoppy on the finish.	4.39
5734	Peche 'n Brett	Cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Nice fruity aroma. Fruity taste with a little dry bitterness and plenty of carbination	4.25
5735	Peche 'n Brett	A - Hazy orange gold color with soapy white lacing.. S - Tangy, tart peach and alot of funk.. T - Peach, apricot, funk, and oak..  161 characters	4
5736	Peche 'n Brett	Poured into a teku pint. Label says Best By: 03/2022.. A- Pours a hazy light amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam. Resilient lacing leaves a thick, solid ring behind.. S- Moderate aromas of Brett funk and peach skin..  1,008 characters	4.44
5737	Peche 'n Brett	I enjoyed this brew, just not quite as much as I expected. The brett is well done and not overpowering, but I found myself wanting more fresh peach out of it. It's there on the nose, but not enough for me in the taste. I had it on tap in Eugene, so I'm not sure when it was brewed, but I assume fairly recently. I doubt the peach has mellowed with age, I just think that's what Logsdon was going for. The alcohol is certainly well hidden. Perhaps I'll give it another shot and revised as warranted. For me, good but not great.	3.86
5738	Peche 'n Brett	Bottle shared at Klooster. Hazy orange with a thin white head. Notes of peaches, wood, light funk, mineral. Mediym body and carbonation and a mellow funky finish.	3.9
5739	Peche 'n Brett	Pours orange, hazy and cloudy. Smells of peach, sugar, floral, dirt. Flavor is abundant of both peach and brett (surprise, surprise) somewhat sharp, but not boozey. ABV is well hidden. I almost wish I aged this longer to get it a bit smoother, but I wanted to taste the peach before it faded. Overall, enjoyable.. but there may be better options for the hefty price tag.	3.84
5740	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Complex and lovely. A top tier lambic. Try it if you get the opportunity. At a fair price, I would drink this as often as I could. Framboos and Hommage are a touch better, but this is in the conversation	4.5
5741	Schaerbeekse Kriek	This was a truly delicious and nicely dry and tart Lambic.. Look: dark red, slightly purple, with a one inch off-white head. Aroma: cherry, citrus, oak..  313 characters	4.83
5742	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Vibrant garnet with a thin, white, slightly pink blanket.. Smell is really strong funk, horse blanket and cherry.. Taste is really smooth cherry pie filling, fresh cherry skin, with light vanilla and cinnamon running in the background..  246 characters	3.98
5743	Schaerbeekse Kriek	"L: Red wine colors drink.
S: Very, very strong kriek flavor.
T: A slow buildup into a strong kirek punch. Unlike other kriek beers in their ineup, it is very smooth and enjoyable.
O: Very grapey.
O: A strong and unique drie fonteinen bottle worth trying at least once."	4.87
5744	Schaerbeekse Kriek	12/23/11 bottle date. Ten year expiry. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a 3F fountain tumbler glass at t brug beertje.. Pours a maroon hazy body with a pink head that reduces moderate rate to leave a ring of retention.. Aromas are heavy cherry and lots of funk - cherry jam and old basement, sharp lactic. Just fantastic..  653 characters	4.59
5745	Schaerbeekse Kriek	"2014 harvest.
Pours deep ruby with small pink head.
Aroma is really funky, sour cherries, lemon, tart,
Taste is sour cherries, bread, wet cellar, lemon, yeast,"	4.59
5746	Schaerbeekse Kriek	A 750ml bottle at Moeder Lambic Fontainas. There were two conflicting bottling dates. The original label has a bottled on date of 28th April 2010 whereas Moeder Lambic added a 2015 bottling label. Whatever research I could muster up shows that there does appear to be a 2015 bottling on 30th January 2015 out there (first since 2011). Poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass.. Appearance: It poured a cloudy dark ruby red colour with a big three finger light pink head that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving very sparse lacing.. Aroma: Very nice fruity cherry and strawberry with a hint of vanilla..  868 characters	4.8
5747	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Absolutely beautiful Kriek. Brick red pour, no head, perfume of earth, cherries, and blue cheese. As it opens up, aromas of tea tree and mint take over. I am humbled by this! The taste is earthy and tart, the fruit doesn't overwhelm.	4.95
5748	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Hearty pink liquid, amazing clarity, lighter pink substantial head. Aroma was drops heavy sour cherry notes, not dark cherry, bright red, bitter, powerful yet light cherry. Even with that amount, a legit +9 on the 1-10 scale, some oak still comes in.. Taste hits that 8 note on the scale, massive cherry drop only to be rivaled by LPK from Cantillon probably. Floats over the wheat. Was surprised when writing my review today to see this is now retired. Glad I got a few when I did, high ass price tag on these, but you're entitled to it on your birthday friend.	4.77
5749	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Massive thanks to Francois for sharing. 2007 vintage.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark cherry juice hue with a thin head that faded immediately to leave thin thin wisps.. S - Aromas of dry tart cherries, light vanilla. Incredibly fragrant cherries and pits..  624 characters	4.52
5750	Schaerbeekse Kriek	"750 bottle into teku. Bottled 4/28/2010.. A: Pours a deep cranberry juice red with a minimal soft white head that faded into a lasting collar.
S: Musty attic, damp basement, and old oak barrel are prominent. The cherry adds a mellow sugary sweetness with tannic notes of cherry pits and skins. Mild cheesiness, faint tartness.
T: Sweeter, juicier, and fruitier than I expected from the nose. Cherries are fruit juice-like, but not cloying. The musty wood and light wheat base follow, with flavors of honey and earth in the finish. The tartness is very mild with just a kiss of bright acid. Flavors remind me of wildflower honey. Slight grape. Wheat and interesting yeast profile come through more as the beer reaches room temp.
M: Medium-light body, smooth and slick mouthfeel with a slight amount of gritty tannins. Drying finish, low acidity, low carbonation.
O: Four and a half years old has done this well. Not as tart or funky as I expected, but very woody with an interesting floral honey sweetness. Very delicious."	4.21
5751	Schaerbeekse Kriek	"The man with the plan brought this over to share a couple weeks back. Cheers dude! The label reads ""Kriek van Schaerbeekse Krieken,"" which is the same as this. If the two entries ever get merged, I figure it's safer to add the review here.. From a 750 into a tasting glass.
Bottled 18 January 2003. APPEARANCE: Pours a small, medium looking pink head with half decent retention. Body is a maroon red color with no real carbonation evident. Head recedes to a bubbly half wisp but eventually vanishes all together. Really nice color on this one..  1,355 characters"	4.05
5752	Schaerbeekse Kriek	"2011 750mL shared among seven. Kicking myself for not buying both bottles on the shelf at 35.99 in 2013.. This is an absolutely beautiful lambic. This bottle had no overpowering sourness mentioned in other reviews, also no medicine.. Amazingly clean with subtle funk, cherry, lightly sour, light body, mild carb with almost no pop when the cork came out, but nicely effervescent when swished. Again, it's a shame I didn't get both dusty bottles off the shelf. I would love to have this again, maybe with a few less people. Everyone absolutely loved it, even the ""i don't really like sours"" guy at the share."	5
5753	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Poured from a 750 ml bottle at the Memphis Taproom while visiting Philadelphia earlier this year. Maybe I got a bum bottle or my tongue was off that night, but compared to 3F's Intense Red Kriek and Oude Kriek, which I love, I found this one overpoweringly and one-dimensionally tart, lacking the bright, distinct fruit character I was hoping for. Still a wonderful sour all things considered, but more assaultive and less complex than the other cherry 3Fs I've had.	4.25
5754	Schaerbeekse Kriek	750 ml poured into a tulip glass.. A- a beautiful deep intense red with a tall pink head that keeps a thick outside lace. A truly beautiful looking ale.. S- seeet cherries, raspberries, and peaches. A very rich funk that instantly makes your cheeks pucker. There is also a slight smell of cough medicine but not as poignant..  766 characters	4.6
5755	Schaerbeekse Kriek	From a 750 ml bottle to a tulip.. A-A normal pour produces very little head; just a thin pink cap that fades quickly to a collar. The beer is raspberry in color and slightly cloudy. Nothing spectacular to look at, but it suits the style.. S-The aroma on this older (2011) bottle is subdued compared to some lambics, but I still smell a good bit of sour cherry. Other scents include champagne, cider vinegar, and a light dose of earthy, barnyard funk. Acidity is moderate to low for the style..  1,321 characters	4.56
5756	Schaerbeekse Kriek	SOUR. Great sour beer, one to be shared.. Pours a nice reddish black beer. Has very little bubbles, yet it is carbonated. Smell is of berries, cherries, etc. Taste is very tart, vinegary. It is not a thick beer, it is medium bodied. Taste remains in your mouth, as well as aroma.	4.27
5757	Schaerbeekse Kriek	750ml bottle served in a Mort Subite chalice.. Bottle date 25/04/2011. A: First of all, beautiful bottle art. Corked 750ml bottle. Pours a dark rose color forming a medium but very fizzy and noisy big bubbled head leaving practically no lacings in the glass.  699 characters	4.61
5758	Schaerbeekse Kriek	2011 vintage, C&C 750ml. Teku glass.. A: Pours crimson with a half finger of attractive, pink-tinted foam, receding moderately soon to a thick ring. Minimal lacing but very good retention.. S: Gorgeous aroma of cherry, red wine, light funk, a bit of grassiness, and dry cinnamon toast..  758 characters	4.75
5759	Schaerbeekse Kriek	"750ml, 4/28/14
Drie Font proper glassware. A: Pours a beautiful deep pinkish red. Fairly still. Some bubbles coming up from bottom.. S: Tart cherry. Oak. Dry funk. Fabulous..  255 characters"	4.4
5760	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Bottled on April 26, 2011.. Pours ruby red with a dark pink one finger head which vanishes immediately, leaving no lacing. The aroma has tart cherries, barnyard funk, and some oak.. Tastes both sweet and tart with tart cherries, oak, funk, and Belgian yeast. Not as acidic as many sours, but there is still some acidity present..  567 characters	4.31
5761	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Intense Red sampled during the RBWG-2014 in Asheville.. Brilliant ruby red color; clear, with a thin, semi-durable, top coat.. Aroma: Moderately funky; slightly fruity..  363 characters	3.14
5762	Schaerbeekse Kriek	Sampled from a 750ml bottle with a bottle date of 12/23/2011 and a best by date of 12/23/2021. Thanks SStein!. A - A brilliant red with a hazy finish and a healthy white head.. S - Wonderful cherry with both sweet and sour notes and incredible richness. Fantastic!.  482 characters	4.48
5763	Schaerbeekse Kriek	750ml, bottled 12/21/2011, poured into a Surly goblet today, 1/20/2014- a bit more than 2 years of age.. App- dark ruby body, thick in appearance, effervescent pink head that sticks for a while. Some lacing. Looks a bit thick and custardy, as if it is cherry jam.. Nose- lot of barnyard funk, vinegar, lactate. Fruitiness is faint cherry, quite tart. Some oak..  1,055 characters	4.4
5764	Schaerbeekse Kriek	750ml from 2010 at Ebenezer's during the Night of the Great Thirst; reviewed from notes.. A: Cloudy vermillion body with almost no head - just a few pink bubbles. Meh.. S: Rich, intense, sour cherry, accompanied by equally rich herbal, earthy, cheesy funk. Perfect..  750 characters	4.73
5765	Todd The Axe Man	Draft at MSP. Hazy golden body, small creamy head. Hazy IPA that is more hop-focused than the norm, but with a tart citric backbone. Really hits the spot.	4.09
5766	Todd The Axe Man	On tap at Dive Bar, NYC.. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange color. A finger length foam head shows good retention and light lacing.. The aroma effectively features the attributes of mosaic hops. Aromas of berries, bubblegum, tangerine, sweet grass and a touch of tropical fruit..  860 characters	4.25
5767	Todd The Axe Man	Canned 3/31/16; drank 4/24/16 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque orange appearance; champagne bubbles throughout.. A rough pour yielded a big, noisy white head which quickly dissipated; minimal lace..  381 characters	3.5
5768	Todd The Axe Man	A: Pours a slightly hazy medium golden caramel in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass and moderate medium yellow + pale golden yellow + honey colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall sudsy foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to large patch of very slightly mottled very thin film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.. S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of juicy citrus/grapefruit, citrus/orange, citrus/lime zest, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit pith, gooseberry, and dank resinous hops over the top of moderate aromas of bready + grainy + caramel + honey malts with a just shy of moderate amounts of caramel + honey sweetness.. T: Upfront there are just shy of moderate flavors of bready + grainy + caramel + honey malts with a just shy of moderate amounts of caramel + honey sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of juicy citrus/grapefruit, citrus/orange, citrus/lime zest, tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit pith, gooseberry, and dank resinous hops which impart a just shy of moderate amounts of lingering bitterness..  1,666 characters	4.28
5769	Todd The Axe Man	CANNED ON 10/11/19. Lightly hazed gold under a fluffy white head of foam that drops to a spotty covering. Aromas of hoppy dankness, orange candy, pineapple, grapefruit. Bright clean hoppy flavor: tropical fruit, berries, mango, grapefruit, herbs, a touch of biscuit malt and sugar cookies. Crisp medium body. Good stuff...	4.2
5770	Todd The Axe Man	Skunky bitter West Coast IPA. There is absolutely nothing interesting about this beer. Normally, I would blame poor taste on the age of the beer, but based on the date on the can, it's barely one month old.	2.76
5771	Todd The Axe Man	The beer looked like a prototypical IPA when poured. The body was pale amber in color, slightly hazy, and formed a one finger thick head. The aroma was very citric, evoking a delicious grapefruit. Deeper inhalation invoked some other fruits like guava and mango. The taste was bright and quit citric, reminding of grapefruit once again. The mouthfeel was medium and the alcohol non evident. Excellent.	4.36
5772	Todd The Axe Man	Clear golden orange with a nice white head that leaves excellent lacing.. Citrus, stone fruit, mostly peach and faint pine. Malt is there but sit way in the back.. Taste is strong hoppy goodness consisting of peach, nectarine skin, citrus and faint pine. Finished dry and bitter..  574 characters	4.38
5773	Todd The Axe Man	Look : One finger white head, hazy orange body.. Smell : See below.. Taste : papaya, toasted bread, mild orange, a hint of resin. Good malt balance..  226 characters	4.63
5774	Todd The Axe Man	L: Caramel orange with lumpy head. It's hazy, and clearly heavily malted, no doubt to hold an unreal amount of hops. After the head settles down, the surface appears buttery/oily.. S: A serious hop boquet. All the hops.. T: A hop forward start and a big malty finish. It lights up your palate..  516 characters	4.4
5775	Todd The Axe Man	16oz can dated 9/6/19.. Pours clear gold with a chill haze and a short head. Retention is minimal. Juicy and piney in the nose. Medium bodied with a crisp, tacky mouthfeel. Pine, grapefruit, and bitter citrus on the palate with balancing malt. Finishes fairly bitter, a bit malty, and with plenty of pine.	4.25
5776	Todd The Axe Man	Murky with ugly dish soap bubbly head.. Smell is pleasant. Pineapple and mango predominantly.. Taste is nice. Finished earthier than expected which I appreciate being a classic IPA guy..  595 characters	4.19
5777	Todd The Axe Man	"16 oz can, dated 9/4/19
Lightly hazy translucent orangy copper with two fingers off white head, full curtains of lacing, surface continents.
Sour pineapple, citrus, guava, pine, honeysuckle, yeast aromas
Orange, grapefruit pith, light caramel, pepper, pine flavors
Soft mouthfeel with bitterness developing, plenty of carbonation, herbal aftertaste.
Unique taste, glad to see it on our beer store shelves."	4.41
5778	Todd The Axe Man	"can (into glass)
Medium orange with slight translucency. Slight toasted malt aroma with a lychee nut tinge. Medium bodied. Various citrus peel flavors with a lingering bitterness."	3.9
5779	Todd The Axe Man	"Canned on 8/19/19. 16oz can poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden, but it's not cloudy or murky; small white head that fades leaving decent retention and lacing. The aromas are floral along with some citrus notes. Mild hints of coconut in the mix. Some fresh grass. Some bread and crackers. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose. Some grapefruit and orange coming through. More subtle hints of coconut. More fresh grass. More bread and crackers. Solid bitterness. Mild spiciness. Some black pepper coming through in the finish. Malts do their thing without dominating. Finishes juicy and dry at the same time, but it's probably on the juicier side. Alcohol goes unnoticed for the most part. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the fuller side of medium-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, crisp, slightly fluffy, smooth and easy to drink.. This is a solid IPA. It's nice, but it's really nothing ""special"" based on the acclaim, in my opinion. It's not bad at all, but I guess I was just personally expecting something crazier. The craftsmanship is on point. Not bad at all."	3.57
5780	Todd The Axe Man	Big waves of citrus straight from the pour. Taste of citrus, tropical fruit, and pine Big bitterness on the finish. Malts are laid back and balanced perfectly with the beer. This is a delicious beer.	4.68
5781	Todd The Axe Man	16oz. can served in a willibecker. Pours a dull, burnt orange with a half inch, fluffy, off-white head. Nose is all old school hops - citrus, herbal, dank and some notes of caramel malt. Taste consistent with nose with a medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation. Overall, a nice old school IPA. A refreshing change from what has become the norm.	3.79
5782	Todd The Axe Man	Had poured from pint can, bottom stamped “CANNED ON 07/16/19,” into nonic pint.. The beautiful gold color of this early-style NE IPA is marred only a bit by yeast floaties, the aroma has many things going on but always juicy citrus, and the drinking is all about citrus bite and variety over just enough malt to get home.	4.19
5783	Todd The Axe Man	"Canned 08/06/2019.. L: Cloudy golden color, off-white head that doesn't last very long.
S: Pine with some citrus notes underneath.
T: Generic citrus, a bit grassy bitterness. Bitterness comes mostly on the finish.
F: Medium body, not sticky or syrupy. Very easy drinking.. Great IPA. Citrus flavors are excellent but Mosaic gives it the herbal grassy bitterness that I want in an IPA. Very good balance between the two hops and extremely easy to drink."	4.17
5784	Todd The Axe Man	"Had from can dated 8/6/19 in Seattle. Was really looking forward to this but was a bit disappointed with it. Had a bit of a ""new brewery"" taste to it. Never know how to describe it but malt and musty. It does tend to happen with midwestern beers I've had before. Very drinkable and otherwise pleasant but just not as good as the 99 rating to me."	3.71
5785	Todd The Axe Man	Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy, medium golden amber with a one finger white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, lemon, grapefruit, light mixed tropical fruit. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, grapefruit, yuzu, orange, lemon, mild guava and pine needles. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this legendary IPA brewery and it is quite nice. Aroma and initial taste are classic Mid to West Coast style, with an emphasis on citrus and pine. The hop herbal flavors reveal themselves over the taste, which is what I hope for in a big IPA. Great alpha oil finish with resinous pine and citrus rind. The malt thins out a little in the finish, but there is still a fine, lingering hop bitterness. I hope this stays in our market; with all the local breweries emphasizing hazies and bruts, I will take my classic IPA fix from any source and this is a promising one.	4.21
5786	Todd The Axe Man	"16oz single can purchased at Hop & Hound in Bothell, Washington.
Just flown in from Minnesota, Canned on date is 08/06/19, two weeks old! Poured in to a pint glass.. Look- Slightly hazy, brilliant, golden honey color. Large, impressive, off-white head that recedes slowly. Solid lacing.
Ample carbonation visible in the glass.. Smell- Citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, lemon), tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, passionfruit), pine, bready malt, slightly floral..  816 characters"	3.98
5787	Todd The Axe Man	Consumed 8/13/19. A: Medium golden orange - hazy but not a turbid slurry, could pass for chill haze - pours with a medium sized off-white head but fades quickly to just a small collar. S: Citra and Mosaic play well together - orange zest, floral citrus, orange and grapefruit juice, with hint of lime - notes of pine and tropical, herbaceous aromas - lightly fruity overall - hoppy but with Midwest sensibility, as there is some malt here to balance - pale grains, light biscuits, malty sweetness.  1,394 characters	4.3
5788	Todd The Axe Man	Wow, I had no idea this was in the top 250 beers of all time... really? And, let's see here... the top American IPA on BA?! Huh. Well then. I picked up a can of this, my first ever Surly offering (though I had the Amagher/Surly collaborative version of this at Lord Hobo for Zwanze Day like five years ago or so, if I recall correctly), at my local Craft Beer Cellar just yesterday afternoon, which I found weird. Maybe that means we'll get more Surly soon. I've kinda always wanted to have a glass of Furious, so I hope that happens.. Anyway, this is a Citra/Mosaic DDH IPA that borders on (but doesn't quite become) a double IPA, and it has a lot to live up to based on those reviews down below mine. Pours a deep golden color, almost like a medium-amber honestly. Remember IPAs looking like this? Yeah, I know, I barely do either. The head is decently foamy, measuring about two-fingers of slightly-off-white suds that lace pretty nicely. Good legs and structure to the head here, for sure, and I can see a lot of carbonation rising from the bottom of my glass, which is always a good sign. I think this is a tad darker in color than the current trends, but the recipe is very 2014, so kudos to them for sticking to their guns.. Even though this was only canned 5 weeks ago (just hit my distribution area, so it's not like I've been sitting on this review or whatever), it smells kind of... old? Sure, there are the requisite tangerine, papaya, pine resin, and grassy notes that every decent Citra/Mosaic IPA should boast, but it just doesn't have a lot of vivacity to it. Some light tannins and crisp biscuity malt come out too... almost has an English IPA bent to it for whatever reason?.  2,454 characters	3.81
5789	Todd The Axe Man	"16 oz can into stemless wine glass. Dated 7/3/19.
Look is nice cloudy orange hue. Smell is spicy and a little malty. Taste follows nose with a little fruit up front then some bitterness in middle and end, Feel is fairly light. Overall a nice IPA more West Coast but a little juice in front end. A nice change of pace from the NE IPAs I have been drinking."	3.92
5790	Coconut B-Bomb	Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with a dark tan head crowning the glass.. Smell - Coconut was evident in the nose, but did not jump out as much as I imagined it would.. Taste - As expected, coconut was a big part of the initial taste. Dark chocolate followed, seeming to be actual chocolate. The profile was very smooth with bourbon notes adding to the smoothness. There was nothing hot about this beer..  613 characters	4.53
5791	Coconut B-Bomb	Poured from fridge temp into snifter. Pours motor oil black with a little bit of light brown head. Nose is chocolate, licorice, coconut, bourbon, cherries, and more chocolate. Taste is insane. Coconut, bourbon, chocolate, molasses, toffee, licorice. Wow - just wow. I could drink this every day. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Overall, this is one of the best BA stouts I have had.	4.78
5792	Coconut B-Bomb	A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2018 release. Poured into a snifter glass.. Appearance: Dark dark brown in colour with a thin brown head that dissipated quickly, but left some spotty lacing.. Aroma: Roasted malts, coconut, chocolate, vanilla and molasses with hints of oak and bourbon..  608 characters	3.74
5793	Coconut B-Bomb	"2017 version. A: Very dark brown with little head
S: Coconut, bourbon, sweet caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, charred oak
T: Coconut, balanced bourbon, milk chocolate, charred oak, light vanilla, dark chocolate, licorice, cherry cola
M: Thicker mouthfeel
O: This has held up very well. No oxidation, super balanced, better than the base and right with the coffee cinnamon variant"	4.43
5794	Coconut B-Bomb	2017 version poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter. The coconut is present but not strong in the aroma or flavor. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and creamy. There isn't much booze presence but a little warming in late finish. Really enjoyable.	4.5
5795	Coconut B-Bomb	Sitting on my back deck in the cold, last vestiges of winter. I have a couple more cellaring, so figured to try this before the warm weather hits consistently. 2018 bomber poured cellar temp to a tulip glass. Nose is subtle vanilla, bourbon, light toastiness. Color is black, which pours with a three finger mocha head that burns fast to a ring with lots of lacing. First sips follow the nose, but with stronger bourbon, more toasty coconut,and barrel. Balanced impeccably. Slightly sweet with a full, creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight warming later. Excellent base stout flavors. Not sure it will warm up, considering it’s about 30 degrees on the deck. Buy it when you see it.	4.62
5796	Coconut B-Bomb	2018 release from a bomber poured to a snifter. Very thick and opaque, viscous when swirled with a full finger of fluffy, homogeneous head. Quite coconut-forward, smart to toast it before adding in order to match better with the dark and bourbon-forward notes of the base beer. As always, a gorgeous mouthfeel, luxuriously smooth and silky on the tongue.	4.6
5797	Coconut B-Bomb	Subtle coconut sets this off for me. Not a huge fan of it. Chocolate, bourbon, brown sugar and toasted coconut with hints of tobacco, smoke, leather and char. Very enjoyable but enjoyed regular B-Bomb a bit more. Adding this or coffee cinnamon masks the complexities of the base blend.	4.54
5798	Coconut B-Bomb	"L: Dark and rich mocha hues with a thin sandy head
S: Dark chocolate and toasted coconut
T: Leads with the bourbon barrel and then complemented by cacao nibs, roasted tobacco leaves, toffee, charred vanilla beans, and a lingering sweetness from the coconut
F: Medium body with ample carb
O: Nice variant in the B-Bomb series; the fresh coconut was subtle for me, but paired well with the delectable robust base profile of B-Bomb - excellent sipper"	4.6
5799	Coconut B-Bomb	This is easily one of the best beers I've ever had. It tastes like a high-quality liquefied Bounty bar. If that means to you what it means to me, you know it's good. Delicious.	4.93
5800	Coconut B-Bomb	2018 bottle poured into a tulip at 55°F.. L: Pours a very dark brown with deep brown head. Low head retention, but it's certainly present immediately after pouring.. S: Bourbon with a bit of the alcohol, coconut, vanilla..  1,002 characters	4.72
5801	Coconut B-Bomb	22oz (2018) into a tulip. Pours that deep reddish mahogany we've come to expect from B-Bomb with a 1-finger light mocha head that settles to a thin collar and film.. Aroma is deep and rich. Bourbon (of course), vanilla, toasted coconut, sweet malty goodness.. Taste follows nose. Such a wonderful blend here. The coconut is front and center, balanced with vanilla, chocolate, bourbon-soaked pipe tobacco, and a hint of smoke. Sweet but not cloying, just absolutely delicious..  739 characters	4.71
5802	Coconut B-Bomb	2018 release. A month or two old.. A: Pours an impenetrably dark brown with a cap of dark brown head that dissipates quickly to thick ring. Decent retention for the minimal head that’s there, and no lacing.. S: Dry cocoa powder, sweet toasted coconut, medium-light bourbon with a bit of alcohol burn, a touch of vanilla bean, and a hint of dried cherry..  721 characters	4.26
5803	Coconut B-Bomb	"Tremendous. Tops my previous favorite for use of coconut in a BBA stout (Half Acre's Benthic).... (had on tap 1.15.19)
L - Dark lacing, opaque, a heavy hitter. Do not underestimate the power of the dark side...
S - Holy moly, coconuts all the way to the bottom with good use of barrel aging, roast
T - Follows with the aroma; fantastic, you're drinking an alcoholic's version of a Mounds bar my friend
F - Great balance, carbonation, not cloying, maybe with taste/feel a little sticky sweet but just delicious.
O - Maybe the best coconut RIS I've had. Just wow. Ugh. Also, don't get any sugar bloodwork done the next day. ;)"	4.5
5804	Coconut B-Bomb	I made the mistake of trading away two bottles of Coco B-Bomb, and sharing a third with friends... and suddenly, the bottle supply had completely dried up and I had nothing left.. Coco B-Bomb is likely my favorite Fremont beer ever - it's rich with tobacco and leather, but coconut is very forward in the nose and taste. It's sweet and syrupy and incredibly wonderful. I've probably romanticized the memory of this beer a bit, but it's one that I will always chase.	4.71
5805	Coconut B-Bomb	22oz waxed bottle poured into 14oz teku. poured a solid very dark brown color, maybe a hint of red at the edges, with 3/4 inch of light brown head that had very good retention and decent lacing.. Lots of sweet, fresh coconut at the front of the nose, with earthy malts and a bit of heat in the background.. Same on the tongue; lots of coconut, good base beer, and a some heat on the finish..  631 characters	3.82
5806	Coconut B-Bomb	Poured a dark brown with slight head. Smell is giant coconut with bourbon, cocoa, molasses, charred wood, leather, maple, and caramel, very decadent, powerful, and complex. Taste is huge coconut, but not to the point of overwhelming the nuanced flavors, barrel really comes through well with the supporting notes as well. Might be the most drinkable strong ale I have had. A decadent coconut dessert ale. Need to try the original!	4.55
5807	Coconut B-Bomb	On tap at Imperial on Alberta for their Fremont event.. A very dark brown with a dark brown head with good retention and lacing, this looks solid. On the nose, this is a spicy coconut explosion with bourbon heat, vanilla, nutmeg, buckwheat honey. Coconut character is outrageous - fleshy, well-toasted, a little roasted grain, excellent. Oily, toasty, coconut on palate aids the finish as well. Excellent..	4.39
5808	Coconut B-Bomb	Dark brown with a tall dense tan foam that settles very slowly to a persistent blanket leaving random worms of lace.. Smell is nutty wet oak paired with some dark chocolate roasted malt and a splash of peppery bourbon. It easily smells like a whiskey dunked milk chocolate Almond Joy.. Toasted coconut and roasted malt collide to give a peanutty flavor with some toasty wafer. The barrel provides some rum-like heat but also enhances the peanut-like coconut with a mild woodiness. As it warms, luscious caramel comes out bringing this into samoa territory..  670 characters	4.17
5809	Coconut B-Bomb	This was by far the best adjunct BA beer I've had from Fremont. I was really impressed with its viscosity due to other Fremont BA stouts not being as thick/mouth-coating. The coconut presence was amplified by the perfect touch of bourbon and chocolate. This beer was a treat and a must have around the holidays. Cheers.	4.68
5810	Coconut B-Bomb	"11/17/18 (Chicago): 1 oz taste glass pour at FOBAB, this offering won the Gold Medal for Specialty / Experimental beers. Pitch black pour, thin off-white fizzy ring around glass. Very strong coconut aroma, not balanced but it is advertised as a ""Coconut Bomb"". Coconut taste overwhelms, whiskey does appear after pour sits, masked and smooth. Thin texture, no carbonation. Overall very good pour."	3.86
5811	Coconut B-Bomb	Had from draft November 2018. Excellent already with a teeny tiny bit of booze bite/burn. Give it another year and it will go down soooooo smooth. Will try next year.	4.67
5812	Coconut B-Bomb	2017 bottle, poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a fine, quarter finger dark khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark toasted and chocolate malt, cocoa, bourbon, coconut and a little oaky vanilla. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt, milk chocolate, coconut, bourbon and vanilla. Lingering chocolate and light coconut. Superb medium to heavy bodied with excellent moderate creaminess, excellent mouth feel. I can't believe I forgot to review this one and glad I had one more bottle (wish I had a case). Definitely an omg beer on the first taste, rich, well balanced, slightly sweet, but not cloying, a silky, creamy mouth feel to die for. This is a world class strong ale that would be hard to improve. And the label makes me laugh every time I see it. Thanks Fremont! I was worried this coconut version might not age well, so only got a couple. Wrong, damn.	4.93
5813	Coconut B-Bomb	The BBomb has and will surely continue to be 0n my top 5 stout or strong ale list. Most of those are from Fremont's barrel aging program. I prefer the Regular to the Coffee Cinnamon, but when I had this at a bottle share I had to start saying top 6 as it is equally amazing if not a tad better. Coconut is the perfect complement to this brew. Luscious is the perfect adjective.	4.85
5814	Coconut B-Bomb	Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Fremont beer can glass. Acquired in a trade.. Pours a deep brown body with a brown one finger head that sticks around for a bit and reduces to a ring of foam for the remainder of the 1 hour or so that I drank this.. Aromas are sweet and dessert-like, coconut macaroon, caramel, vanilla, boozy bourbon, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, all melded together to create a delicious medley..  794 characters	4.59
5815	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	"canned 9.16.19, opened 10.27.19. ""if life were easy and not so fast"". Poured into a Nonic, black motor oil liquid, solid creamy brown two finger foam cap , good lacings, good retention.  348 characters"	4.5
5816	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Prepping for a wedding, hopefully this is a good luck charm.. A- Tallboy pours into a tall chalice with a black as the midnight sky body and a very, very dark cocoa powder hue to the cap. The crown shoots up to an inch high with very good retention and a thick, frothy-foamy texture. Thick coral-esque webs of lacing.. S- Cocoa, cocoa, cocoa. Rich, bitter and semi-sweet chocolate dominates the aroma alongside some of the other roasty things like the charred barley and some dark roast coffee beans. Chocolate syrup, sweet milk chocolate bars, fudge, slight dark fruits, milk and cookies, fruity very dark chocolate and a hint of toasted nuts..  1,703 characters	4.59
5817	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Canned 9/16/19; drank 9/24/19 @ the Yarchives.. Motor oil black appearance.. A violent pour yielded a HUGE dark khaki head; frothy, tree-rung lace..  351 characters	4.42
5818	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	"Canned on 9/16. Opened on 10/08.
Looks like almost black !
Coffee+Chocolate+Cocoa Tastes and sweetness is nice balanced level.
Quite smooth, tasty with medium Carbo.
Might be good as ""dessert beer"" ?
ABV 6.5%"	4.43
5819	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	"Big thanks to thebeers for this
16 oz can, dated 12/21/18, poured into a teku. A- Black with a two finger mocha head.. S- Rich chocolate and coffee, caramel malts, some roasted malts. Huge nose for only 6.5%..  434 characters"	4.56
5820	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a very dark and oily black. gently poured so a finger’s worth of mocha head. the mocha color stays through the entire pour in the form of a ring around the edges with swirls in the middle. smell is strong chocolate and taste follows smell. this is a chocolate bomb! none of that half-ass coffee smell and taste i get with a lot of TH stouts. feel is full and very well carbonated. this packs a lot of flavor and is quite full on mouthfeel for a little 6.5% stout. been rather down on a lot of their stouts lately so glad to see that this one lives up to the always-present TH hype.	4.5
5821	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	"L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a deep black body that allows barely any light through. Quite surprising given the ABV. Finger of light brown head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and some lacing
S — Nutty coffee, cacao powder, light roastiness, hint of cinnamon
T — Coffee and barely-dark chocolate take center stage here. Bit of brown sugar, maple, roast, nutty coffee
F — Amazingly thick and velvety for the ABV. Straight up feels like a >10% stout. Super easy drinking
O — Another solid offering in the TH lineup of canned milk stouts.. 84/100"	4.18
5822	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Poured into a teku glass via can dated 4/10/2019. color is a cola brown with light tan foam. smell is Maple, baker's chocolate and coffee.  394 characters	4.47
5823	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Solid beer. Tastes like a lot of the other Treehouse stouts. Pours dark with tan head. Nose is muted chocolate and copper. Taste is big chocolate, a bit sweet. Lots of flavor for a relatively low abv stout	3.9
5824	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Can. Tan head. Black color.. Rich, roasted malts, coffee, caramel, cocoa powder, Hershey’s syrup, and chocolate. A lot more body and flavor than the abv would suggest. Very flavorful.	4.2
5825	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Poured from a 16oz can into a Treehouse tulip glass.. Pours a deep black, inky body with a substantial frothy brown head that reduces to leave nice layered lacing.. Aromas are straight chocolate fudge and cocoa, Hershey's syrup, coffee. On the tongue it's decadent and rich but not overly filling or cloyingly sweet, very drinkable silky smooth body with milk chocolate and cocoa dominating flavor, and a coffee aftertaste.	4.52
5826	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Pours a nice dark chocolate color with a taste of maple sugar candy and coffee in the nose and first hit to the palate. A little too sweet to drink too many but definitely a favorite for a cold New England night.	4.5
5827	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Best milk stout I've ever had. Got this as an extra in a trade, and while I don't remember the exact details of it's appearance, overall - I've never forgotten that chocolaty rich indulgence!	4.6
5828	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Very dark brown appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a sweet malt and coffee that is pleasant. Taste is a sweet coffee malt combination with a touch of chocolate.	4.33
5829	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	This one startled me - my expectations of Tree House stouts has just continuously dropped as I've had more, so I overlooked All that Is more than just a bit. I recently received a can in a BIF group - decided to share it with some friends at a local restaurant.. Jesus. What a mistake! Should have stayed home, turned off the lights and lit some candles - this should have been a romantic experience!. Soft, delicious, roasty coffee. Creamy. Sweet. I cannot articulate how much depth and dimension this beer has. For a canned stout, WTF - this is incredible. I'm very impressed - Tree House is back on my stout list with this beer. Looking forward to trying more... of this one in particular. Amazing!	4.64
5830	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Pours opaque, jet black in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is deep cocoa, milk chocolate, and coffee. Medium bodied, sweet, roasty, with medium-low carbonation. Makes for a really good stout. I prefer some other Tree House stouts more, but this is really good.	4.3
5831	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	16oz can. Pours a viscous black color with a thin layer of head. Very little lacing. The aroma is lots of chocolate syrup along with hot cocoa, earth, roasted malts and chocolate milk. First sip is tons of chocolate milk and chocolate syrup. Dark chocolate with a hint of dark cherries and a bit of black coffee. Charcoal, roasty finish with a bit more chocolate syrup. Medium to heavy body with light carbonation. Tastes boozier than expected.	4.09
5832	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Not gonna lie - I find the adjectives and emotion behind Tree House’s beer descriptions a bit much (reflect, fluffy, gift, love...all in one beer!) but, no joke, this beer is spectacular.. Call it a pastry stout, dessert beer, an after-dinner-beer or whatever the fuck you want - it’s delicious any way you cut it.. Pastry stout? Yeah, there are no foodstuffs thrown into the mash but this beer is all about sweet decadence. The velvet mouthfeel, ample heft and multi-dimensional sweetness is unreal for the ABV chassis..  827 characters	4.43
5833	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	From can, PlPours black with thick beige head. Lot of milk chocolate aroma with a hint of coffee. Taste is moderate to heavily sweet. Flavor is huge cocoa upfront with vanilla and coffee notes. Chocolate milk like. Excellent milk stout.	4.64
5834	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Unbelievably fluffy beer. Simply put, these were my first thoughts with this beer.. A slick, smooth pour of stark black tar raises a moderate, densely creamy milk chocolate tan foam that settles to a persistently thick convex film leaving tall, solid curtain sheeting.. Smell is milk chocolate, almond, pecan, chocolate syrup and a hint of mocha liqueur..  775 characters	4.42
5835	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	This beer pours a thick and viscous motor oil black with an small rich and inviting, complex khaki tan head that quickly . dissipates. The smell is roasted malts, almost smoky with heavy dose of chocolate and a sampling of cold brewed coffee. The taste is very chocolaty syrup or brownie batter, thick and rich on the palette. There's a slight brew coffee and a hint of bitterness late, but a nice drinking milk stout.	4.58
5836	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	The smell and taste are pure melted chocolate bars. This should be served as an adult beverage on the Polar Express! It's an amazing, sweet, smooth stout that delivers joy.	4.93
5837	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	12/21/18 canning date.. A: Pours an impenetrable black with a finger of dense, espresso-like medium brown head. Some streaks of lacing with very good retention.. S: Rich medium-dark roast coffee, nutty dark chocolate. Sort of a chocolate ice cream like aspect..  618 characters	4.35
5838	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	Probably my least favorite of the Sweet Milk Stout series, although still a really great beer.. Super chocolate bomb with not much else going on. A little thinner than the other stout offerings. If you love chocolate stouts you will love this.	4.23
5839	All That Is And All That Ever Will Be	TREE HOUSE ALL THAT IS AND ALL THERE EVER WILL BE MILK STOUT 1/1/19. Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Samuel Smith English tulip.. a: Opaque black with an inch and a half tan head which receded to thin surface foam and dense lacing..  661 characters	4.33
5840	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Can at RateBeer Summer Gathering. Super hazy, no head. Fruity juicy aroma. Taste is mostly citrus, but the dry hopping adds some nice bitterness, dry and tingly.	4
5841	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Pours a pale orange, milky and opaque, off white head, short but persistent, with curtains of lacing. Nose is banana and pineapple, mango and orange, and taste is similar, adding a pine-mint freshness, with a pithy acidic bite in the finish. One of the best I’ve had from Trillium.	4.77
5842	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Picked this up on Monday at Canton. Canned 6/3. L: Beautiful cloudy orange/peach with 1 inch of dense foam. Really pretty. S: Mango, peach, and plum. Very light aroma of molasses..  617 characters	4.07
5843	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	"L: complete haze and a light pastel orange with a finger of foam that fades fast
S: orange and tangerine with the Rhine's. Sweet but dank...great aroma
T: big tangerine, mostly juice but slight whole fruit purée. I love Trillium’s balance in their ipas. World class every time
F: smooth and creamy with a slight back of the tongue dank bite that keeps me coming back for me. Wet and refreshing finish with out the bitterness and drying."	4.54
5844	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Picked-up four cans at the Trillium brewery in Canton for about twenty dollars. My tenth brew from these guys. This was very good, one of my favorites from them. Don't love the price point, but would buy again.	4.5
5845	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Canned 9/27/16; drank 10/10/16 @ the Yarchives.. Opaque dull orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a HUGE white head; strong, frothy lace..  354 characters	3.9
5846	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Opaque nearly glowing orange-yellow with a moderate off-white fizz that settles to a soft central film and a raised but thin collar.. Smell is spicy, dank and resiny, but also tropical and citrusy with a touch of toasted biscuit.. Smooth, round, and lightly crisp with an uncharacteristically substantial body for a glass of Trillium haze, tangy flavors of lime, blood orange and mint-spiked lemonade transition to sightly acidic onion and burnt pine resin before the slightly stinging, semi-dry swallow.	4.03
5847	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	16 oz can, into glass. hazy opaque in appearance, yellow golden color, thick white head. good head retention. big huge hop aroma, well rounded - fruity, dank. similar flavor, medium bitterness, smooth feel.	4.3
5848	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Canned 7/10/18. Enjoying in a glass, at home, courtesy of the in-laws.. Powerful citrus smell, a little like OJ at the tail end of its sell-by date. Very sweet entry, almost like citrus soda. Lingering carbonation. Great, long, slightly bitter finish.. Wasn’t too sure about this one on the nose, but the taste, feel and finish really brought it around. Another really good beer from Trillium!	4.43
5849	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Trillium DDH street IPAs always seem to be so well balanced. Not to bitter, not too boosy. El dorado oftentimes tastes too candy like so was a bit hesitant but this is the best el Dorado beer I have had.	4.44
5850	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Pint canned on 7/10/18 opened up on 7/15/18. The color seems to be that of the New England style ipa standard: a milky golden with tints of white haze and orange juice. Opaque and thick. Creamy white dome, settles down to thin coverage. Only a thin ring of bubbly foam remains with minimal lacing leftover.. A malty scented sweetness of raw honey and golden wheat pops out for me first. Bright citrus fruits, pineapple and orange crush soda from the hops. Zesty grapefruit, tangy, sour-grassy earth in July. Tangerine and lemmon, vanilla and cream topping. The nose is simply an intense delight. Perhaps the most fruity-sweet domininant hoppy nose I've ever had the pleasure of inhaling..  1,470 characters	4.59
5851	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Pours to the lighter side of the NE IPA-style, very hazy but not milkshake consistency, and looks like the glass of grapefruit juice I had this morning, except this has a thick, tan head. The nose is full of grapefruit notes and some spicy citrus aromas, but there’s an earthy note that’s intriguing.. The grapefruit is right in your face on the taste, but that earthy flavor adds a different texture to this, and there’s also some lemon lime notes that are really fantastic. Most excellent job by Trillium, IMHO.	4.49
5852	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	2/20/18. Exactly 1 month old can date. Nice dark amber-honey color with a creamy head of 2 fingers.. Very lovely fruity aromas, completely full of plump juicy mango, tangerine, cantaloupe, orange, nectarine, and soft hints of vanilla.. A nice crackery-bready malt (in equal proportions) starts off the base layer of this beer, building on sharp pine and lemon rinds, darting off to juicy mango, tangerine, white wine, pepper, and a finish of green grape. The cracker and rind are left buzzing behind on the palate while the fruits soak in nicely..  765 characters	4.33
5853	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	"DDH Sleeper Street - Trillium
IPA - 7.2% abv
Canned 2/13/18 (22 days ago). L - 2-finger yellowed head atop a juicy orange body.. S - very juicy. Grapefruit, mango, papaya, blood orange. Some sweetness in the nose as well. No booze..  651 characters"	4.25
5854	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	The beer pours a deliciously white and creamy head that dissipates at a moderate pace. It still leaves a good amount of beer around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a cloudy and opaque medium orange that strongly resembles orange juice. It is beautiful.. The smell is fantastic. The smell has as fairly strong lime zest that comes out the strongest compared to the other notes with a wood note following it. The grapefruit is actually fairly mild compared to the other two but adds a good fruity complement.. The taste is really good but the smell is better. The zest isn't as strong as it is in the smell and actually comes out more in the finish. The wood note comes out strong when compared to the lime floral notes. The grapefruit notes are there but it is more of a unripe white grapefruit. It's still good but a bit light..  1,128 characters	4.57
5855	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	"Serving: Can
Canned: Feb-13-2018. 
A:
Pours a murky rotten mango color with a finger of short-lived soapy head. Middlin' retention; barely-there lacing. (3.75). S:
Really interesting hop aroma. Vanilla, imitation mango, moss, olives (!?), herbs. Something incredibly vivid that I can't quite place. (4.5).  1,042 characters"	4.36
5856	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Solid beer. Very interesting flavor profile with the Key Lime feel and zest. Solid. Just can't get too amped for this in the mail. Toppling Goliath beers are blasting this right now locally	4.39
5857	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	"Canned 11 days ago. My twenty-fifth review of a Trillium beer!. L -- Standard Trill-juice orange haze with a small rocky white head produced with aerated pour. Minimal retention or lacing. I've had similar experiences with certain batches of DDH Congress, so my guess is the sub-par head is due to the intense late-addition hopping.
S -- Lime, Concord grape, citrus peel, mild fusels, watermelon, guava, perfumey floral, and a hint of that fresh paper smell when you open a new ream of copy paper. Sweet, clean, juicy
T -- Watermelon Jolly Rancher, Concord grape, citrus zest, bready malts, grapefruit flesh, grassy earthiness
F -- Crisp and semi-dry. Tapering, earthen, astringent bitterness on the finish. Medium mouthfeel, medium carb.
O -- The zestiness imparted by the El Dorado hops reminds me a lot of Trillium's experimentation with the Enigma hop, but it's much more rounded here by the overripe watermelon and grapefruit character. Still getting sticker shock on these DDH releases, though, even after many trips to the brewery..... Knocking 0.25 off the overall for that reason alone. 90/100"	4.48
5858	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Poured into a can shaped pint glass canned on 2/13/18. Pours like a glass of pineapple orange juice, with a 2 finger sticky head, and leaves behind loads of webby lace.. Smell is guava, passion fruit, pineapple, and some grapefruit rind.. Taste follows tropical front to back with a very balanced shot of grapefruit in the deliciously balanced finish..  557 characters	4.66
5859	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Drinking from a 4 day old can poured into an appropriate glass. Murky yellow orange with a 2 finger head. The descriptors from Trillium are on point. Just fantastic stuff. One can't drink regular things after this...	4.94
5860	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Wonderful. I keep getting happier and happier having to rate a treasure trove of their beers I lucked out on as I was heading to Florida for the winter. AND to get bragging rights as well. Damned if it gets much better than this. Thank u Trillium.	4.48
5861	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Pours a hazy orange color with a one inch white head that left a nice ring of lacing. Smells of tropical and citrus fruits. Tastes of mango and orange with additional notes of grapefruit, lime, pine and malt. Medium bodied and carbonated, moderate bitterness, smooth mouth feel.	4.5
5862	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	masterful hoppy creation. on tap at the source. dry finish. medium mouthfeel. emphasizing dry hop flavour. Had again and liking again a year later. Trillium unique.	4.12
5863	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Pours a hazy orange, with fine, thick foam.. Smell is juicy, with lots of mango anf citrus being joined by hints of licorice and vanilla.. Taste is so juicy... mango and orange are the dominant flavors with just a hint of licorice..  339 characters	4.6
5864	Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street	Poured from a tallboy can into a pint glass.. L: Murky golden orange pour. It looks like the consistency would be pulpy orange juice. Thick foamy white head. Great ring of lacing.. S: Smells tropical and fruity... loads of citrus and fruit..  834 characters	4.56
5865	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	"Pours a mostly clear yellow orange with two fingers of white head
Smells of light funk, lemony citrus, earthy, oak.
Taste follows, lemon, oak, funk, green apple tartness.
Quite crisp and refreshing.
Overall very balanced, excellent example of the style. My first from SARA didn't disappoint."	4.54
5866	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Everything done perfectly to balance this beer. Clean, simple and refreshing - I could drink this all day.. Pairs well with fish and breaking up the stouts during a share	4.5
5867	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Picked up a bottle to-go at the brewery, enjoyed a few hours later.. Golden hue with a thin head that fades quickly. Light effervescence.. Aroma is tart and crisp citrus - lemon and persimmon - with an oaky and earthy backdrop..  325 characters	4.25
5868	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	On tap Toronado SD, into a chalice.. Straw-yellow in color, slightly hazy with a small wispy head, dissapating quickly. Nose is of lemons and unripe berries, touch of funky oak. Flavors follow, if not slightly more fruit-forward, with a hint of cherry sweetness midsip. Quick, crisp, tart finish with lingering notes of sour apple.. Kinda of a legendary brew here in CA, I remember tasting this at the Firestone Invitational some years ago, nice to be able to do a proper review.	4.54
5869	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	The beer pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of lemon, apples, funk, and a little floral. It is lightly tart, with lemon, pineapple, earthy funk, and floral. The feel is medium. A great Saison from Sante Adairus.	4.75
5870	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Has a very barrel forward nose, defined by leather, wet basement, moldy wood and yogurt. The interesting thing about this is, that there is a recognizable freshness, coming from the base beer, at the same time. It provides aromas of lemon zest, soft wheat and dried herbs, building up a perfectly enjoyable collision.. Has a fine effervescence with a light, sour and dry body, making this remarkably refreshing, with a nice smoothness to it.. Tastes of an initial flavor explosion on the palate, mellowed by a pleasant yeast silkness, enriching unripe grapefruits, kiwi pulp, mushrooms and blue cheese amongst warming campfire wood. Turns a tad sweeter, with toffee joining in, highlighting the oranges by adding a fruity sweetness, entagled into the oak. This gets softened by an aqueous quality, producing just a light hint of spices, perfectly integrating lemon zest and a late herb dryness with some prevailing mushrooms..  1,224 characters	5
5871	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Dirty gold pour, slight haze, lots of head and lace. Musty aroma, citrus, fruit, light oak. Fairly tart up front, lemon, cellar notes, lightly salty, berries, floral. Medium body.	4.45
5872	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Split with Goblinmunkey7 on 8/19/17, review from notes. A: Golden straw with a touch of orange, lightly hazy, pours with a fluffy, medium-sized white head, retains its fluffiness, leaves great streaks of lacing. S: Funky, deep, complex - saison funk, yeast funk, barnyard funk - light tartness - lemon - flowery and floral - light grains, light sweetness - loads of wood, rich oak - layers of funk.  927 characters	4.24
5873	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Pale yellow-orange with a fuzzy white surface leaving random fluid arms of lace.. Smell is blue cheese, wood, funk, hay, and lemon.. Taste is tart lemon with a nice frothy crispness, as well as really sour grapefruit, with a semi-dry finish, but also a little stickiness.	3.92
5874	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adairius snifter glass. Acquired in a trade.. Pours a sunshine-golden, hazy body with a big fluffy white three finger head that reduces slowly to leave nice lacing and good retention.. Aromas are funky, yeasty, barnyard and heavy acidic citrus, oak and champagne sitting on a light malty backbone. This smells heavenly!.  671 characters	4.56
5875	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Pours golden yellow with a small white head of about 1 finger. Has a lemony, citrus smell. Nice tart, lemony, smooth acidic flavor. Very nice on a hot day. Wonderful beer.	4.65
5876	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Beautiful beer. Light, tart and refreshing. Perfect beer for a hot day. Drank this while floating in my pool all afternoon! Made my float more enjoyable!	4.36
5877	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Thanks to eyebereej for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Cigar City Brewing goblet.. A: Pours a nearly clear light gold, with just a bit of chill haze. Forms a half-finger's worth of white head that fades quickly atop a very modest amount of visible carbonation.. S: Lightly tart and lemony citric, with barnyard and earthy funk. Light cracker malts underneath..  1,352 characters	4.14
5878	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	"L: Warm golden hues of hay, straw, and apricot with a thin foamy head
S: Lemon peel, white peach, and a mild barnyard funk
T: Kaffir lime leaves, granny smith apples, lemon pith, and pinot grigio
F: Light, dry, and crisp with a moderate carb
O: This is a phenomenal tart, crisp, and herbal saison. Reminds me a bit of The Broken Truck from de Garde. Flawlessly executed with just the right amount of funk. I would die to have a glass of this on a warm midsummer's night."	4.79
5879	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Very light gold in color. White head.. A very nice saison beer. Oaky and fruity. Herbal. Lemony. Tropical fruit blend. Earthy. Spice notes. Light tartness.. Light bodied. Very easy to drinking. This is well done. Wow!	4.49
5880	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	good heavens this is good. thanks to drlovemd87. he purged his cellar this week and i was the fortunate dumping ground. he may have mixed up, because this is insanely special beer, and i am very lucky to have tried it. cracked the bottle knowing nothing about it, but was quickly impressed with its every detail. neat frosted yellow color to it, good white head, creamy and rich, but soft and delicate too, dreamy and sexy, cool. smells awesome, slight tartness to it, but some of that is the hop tropicality going on, funky brett, very mature and dry, with a bit of pucker to it, maybe a hint of some souring cultures, but a lot more brett than bacteria from what i can gather. lots of hops too, juicy and tropical, southern hemisphere and heavy handed. i get some wheat in the malt base, belgian pils, maybe some oats too, it has that fluffy texture to it. the oak is impressive here, maybe a slight suggestion of white wine, but here i get vanilla and sweetness from wet fresh oak, not a barrel of any kind. tons of must and musk and funk from the brett, an old school belgian type i would guess, reminds me of some cool old world saisons in that way. lemony as can be, but also pineapple, lime, and passion fruit come into the fold with the hops. what i want to savor and remember about this thing though is the yeast, i want it forever on my palate, i want to copy it in my homebrew, and i want every brewery who attempts to make beer in this style to try it, because this is what its supposed to taste like. unsure ive had one ive liked this much. great carbonation, crackling dry, and with a very special mystique about it in general. i want to bathe in this stuff. my goodness.	4.53
5881	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Tart granny smith apple, lemon, yogurt, lime, white peach, white wine, minerals and oak. Very short, crisp, dry finish. Faint fennel note. Creamy mouthfeel. This is amazing.	4.44
5882	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Definition of 1 dimensional.. A reasonably sour, golden ale with oak notes. Overall quite nice, but nothing to write home about. Would buy again, though probably only 1 bottle. As a side, everyone else kept saying how balanced it was, however i get none of that. To me it was just a very tart saison, or a light american wild	4.25
5883	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Poured a slightly hazy bright yellow with a fluffy, beautiful white head. Aromas of lemon, funk, citrus zest, and buckwheat meld perfectly together. A really excellent saison with a perfect, lingering finish.	4.5
5884	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Batch 2. Pours a slightly hazy, very pale straw yellow color with fizzy white head. Funk, citrus, and tartness on the nose; follows onto the palate. Light bodied. Finishes tart and dry.	4.35
5885	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	A very lovely balance of tart and funk. Look is a perfect effervescent gold. Scent is lemony-orange oak. The tart soaks into your gums like a nice gueuze. Indeed the overall experience is like a nice gueuze	4.54
5886	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Pours bright and honey colored with a medium haze and minimal head.. Smells sweet and sour with some pleasant medicinal herbs mixed in: lemongrass, lemon peel, peppery yeast, chardonnay oak. Delicate, very nicely barreled.. Tastes like it smells: a lemony, peppery wisp of summer. Medium tart (it's a few months old and wears its age very well). Not much by way of the honey sweetness and intense brett that others have described. The lemon prevails throughout, starting like lemon juice and ending like a shock tart, saison barley evening things out, ending on pepper and light wood.	4.37
5887	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	Hazy yellow color with white head and very nice lacing. Aroma has some earthy funk, lots of brett character but also somehow clean. Taste has lemony tartness, hay and barnyard notes. It also has some woody notes and a pronounced acidity. Overall it's a really well made beer but not as special as I expected.	4.3
5888	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	L: cross between white and pale, good haze level, white head which dissipates quickly. S: tartness, bit of funk, some fresh lemon. T: crisp and bright, good refined lemony tartness, mild funk.  292 characters	4.45
5889	Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison	750ml bottle Pours light with a mild haze. Aromas of lemon and farmhouse funk. Tastes of citrus and fruit, oak, with some mellowed barnyardiness. Quite bright and tart and finishes super dry. Kind of reminiscent of a buttery and dry white wine that has been funkified. A very enjoyable beer! SARA does no wrong!	4.43
5890	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	First 3 of the 4 pack were fresh and this last one is just short of a year in the cellar. Pours about as dark as it gets and just as you think there will be no head at all, a centimeter of thick foam slowly appears out of the abyss. Nose is vanilla, brown bread, leather, and what to me smells like brown sugar pop tarts. Taste is...damn that's fucking good. Pretty much what you'd expect from the nose but the thickness of this beer is pretty amazing considering the ABV and barrel aging. Some tobacco, and some residual sweetness really round this out. Overall, damn.	4.59
5891	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2017 bottle courtesy of @FlintB back in NBS BIF #007.. Side by side with a 2013 bottle of the basic Expedition.. Pour is immediately evident that there's some differences. Dark brown head gathers and sits in a cloudbank across the middle (compared to a pale desaturated brown for the basic). A gentle swirl brings all the fuzzy mocha brown head back to coat the top. Thick obsidian body absorbs all light coming it's direction..  1,174 characters	4.44
5892	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. Another part of the deal with @jhavs, Thank you!
The beer pours a jet black hue with minimal tan head foaming up and fading quickly to a thin edge layer.
The aroma is boozy! Lots of bourbon and vanilla and some peppery heat too. Rich dark chocolate and molasses also mix in but I dont get any hop presence on this brew.
The first sip reveals a thick body and coating sticky texture. Carbonation is mild, fine and gentle. This is a sipping brew! WOW! BIG physical traits here.
Flavor is rich and malty, with dark chocolate high cacao stuff, molasses, some burnt coffee and a bit of bourbon and vanilla mixing. The finish is sweeter with some brown sugar and bourbon coming through and then the warming booze comes in too. This is a big beer and it lets you know too.
Nice complex and bold beer. Glad I finally got to try this one as I find it very enjoyable. Definitely a sipping beer but certainly an enjoyable one!"	4.65
5893	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"2016 vintage bottle poured into a snifter. This beer, to me, is amazing in every way. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. An excellent mix of coffee, chocolate and bourbon. If 3 years of aging is the ""sweet spot"" I can't wait to crack my 2018 in 2021."	4.71
5894	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Sweet, thick, black stout. Smell is filled with bourbon, molasses, chocolate, coffee and some alcohol. That's sweet with toasted oak, dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee and bourbon. Very great beer.	4.47
5895	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	2018 Vintage, bottled on 10/16/18. Purchased at Loosa Brews, Tuscaloosa, AL.. Viscous, black pour straight from the bottle. Good-looking body to the beer, with small amounts of tan head that fail to rise very high at the temperature it is poured. The head settles into a very thin ring around the beer.. Right away, getting a lot of vanilla, barrel, and roasty malts on the nose. Underlying sweetness that brings out dark fruit, but a very well-balanced aromas that invite further complexity as the beer opens up and warms..  1,174 characters	4.19
5896	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Pours a meat black with a finger of mocha head.
Smells of chocolate, vanilla, caramel, roasty malts, slight barrel presence.
Taste follows, dark fudgy chocolate, vanilla, roasty malts.
Medium body with good carb levels. Warming alcohol presence initially but finishes pretty smooth.
Overall an excellent BA stout, the fact that it is pretty easily available makes it even better."	4.6
5897	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	It looks motor oil thick and used motor oil black and shiny in the glass. Minimal dark tan head rests on top and quickly diffuses into spotty islands of lace and a thin ring around. The aroma is huge vanilla, oak, bourbon, and dark bakers chocolate. Taste is Ah-mayze-ing! Super rich dark chocolate is the first thing that hits me, followed by some tobacco, vanilla, oak, a little coffee, and some slight bourbon heat on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but still on the full side of medium. Oily, slick, coating my mouth at all angles with a dry finish but NOT chalky. Overall this is fantastic and every bit worthy of its high marks.	4.85
5898	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Had this for the second time with a little more age, and while it is not a Black Note, or a Fremont, BCBS, or KDS it is really close to the latter with different characteristics - this is truly a stout to be reckoned with in a field of wannabes!	4.31
5899	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours a dark fizzy head with low retention and lacing (expected), good legs, very dark basically black color. nose is intense, loads of dark chocolate, cocoa, licorice, baking spices, raw vanilla and oak barrel with some nice whiskey notes, turning to sweet bourbon, cookie dough, rich dark malts, a little roasty and coffee like, caramel, biscuity, fudgey, a little perfumey alcohol and some mild dark fruits, raisin plum notes, nice bourbon vanilla and chocolate really going. Taste again super rich, tons of dark chocolate, bitter roasty cocoa and coffee, fudge, thick chewy fudge, vanilla ice cream and raw vanilla, with some bourbon juice with raw oak barrel as well, some dark fruits in the background again plum and chocolate raisin, more cocoa an dark chocolate, fudge, fair perfumey alcohol but stops short of fusel, some bitterness from earthy spicy hops and roasty malts, baking spices, licorice, thick char and dense malt layering the tongue, lingering on the sticky sweet finish, burnt malts and char late, bit more alcohol, loads of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and charred roasty bitter almost acrid notes.  1,491 characters	4.49
5900	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"12oz bottle courtesy of ovaltine. Bottled October 16, 2018, per the rear label.. Poured into a stemmed tulip glass, this came out the bottle like a river of crude oil, and assumed in the glass a darkness that was utterly impervious to light. Tiny, mocha colored head that nevertheless stuck around, showing a lot of pluck for such a boozebomb beer. Streaky lace that while infrequent, was more elaborate than I expected for the reason just noted.. Big nose to this. No way you can lift this up to your nose and doubt it was bourbon barrel aged. Oakey, boozy barrel aroma, with a touch of vanilla and toffee, beguile the workers at the olfactory. At the same time, it's not a big, crude, ""hot"", almost medicinal type of booziness, unlike some really big BBA stouts I've had. It almost seems wrong to use ""subtle"" as a descriptor for this beer's nose. So, I won't, but it's undeniably smooth..  1,639 characters"	4.49
5901	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottled 10/16/2018. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a very dark walnut - nearly black - with a half finger of creamy, light mocha-colored head and thin sheen of lacing. On the fragrant nose there is a heavy scent of bourbon along with roasted malt, dark chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, toffee, hazelnut, and black cherry. This is absolutely delicious! It opens with rich chocolate and coffee followed by caramel/toffee, tobacco, char, and the always welcome notes of black cherry and plum. The bourbon is strong but not overpowering. It compliments the other flavors rather than distracting. The mouth feel is rich and creamy with low/moderate carbonation, and the 13.4% ABV is delightfully warming. While I'm a big fan of the standard version of Expedition, this is an entirely different drinking experience. It stands toe to toe with KBS.	4.53
5902	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Pours a very dark brown — near black — with a finger of mocha-colored head that lasts a decent amount of time for such a large beer. Sheets of lacing.. Sweet bourbon with vanilla, almond and cherry notes; brownie batter; hazelnut; and a hint of plum and umami in the nose.. Loads of rich chocolate and strong alcohol burn in the taste. Sweet bourbon hits mid-palate, along with a hint of sherry. There’s a touch of meaty smoke, a little nuttiness and distinct bitter chocolate in the finish..  689 characters	4.25
5903	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	I don’t think the bourbon really imparts much flavor to this one and it never finds that harmony between the base beer & the barrel. Lots of charred oak, tobacco leaf, black anise, etc...misses some of those smoother counterpoints (vanilla, caramel, etc) bourbon can bring to balance it out	3.67
5904	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Drinking it straight from the fridge (meaning too cold) and I notice the smell is bourbon and chocolate. It pours thick and syrupy. Lacing sticks around after the pour. As it warms, the chocolate bitterness builds and strengthens. There's a lot going on flavor wise. There's some sweetness but less than a BCS. It drinks very very smooth and although I taste the alcohol a bit, it's not overbearing at all. I'm glad I finally scored some this year and will try to get it always.	4.54
5905	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Absolutely a world class beer all the way around... jeez... this is really really good... big barrel influence in absolutely the best way... it's what I look for in a barrel aged offering... it's there...and big... but it's not the star...the base beer still is... complete wheelhouse for me...like fudgy bourbon balls that you get at Christmas.... do not pass this one up if you spot it... worth every penny...	4.75
5906	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"12oz bottle into Tulip
Bottled on 10/16/18
Pours dark brown with a dark brown head that dissipates quickly
Chocolate, vanilla, fudge
Dark chocolate, raisins,  vanilla and oaky finish
The feel is full bodied yet super drinkable for a 13.4% BBA stout
Overall this is one of if not the best BBA stout I've ever had. This tastes like expedition barrel aged, but the barrel only implies subtle notes, so it's not a new product, but a great one amplified. Super balanced and super drinkable."	4.65
5907	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Big thanks to Blackop555 for this
12 oz bottle, dated 10/16/18, poured into a teku. A- Black with small mocha head. S- Bourbon, dark chocolate, some roasted malts, some vanilla, caramel malts, touch of charred oak.  412 characters"	4.56
5908	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"bottle dated ""10/16/2018"" or packaged as Bell's likes to use. This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a nice looking dark brown close to black color topped with a slim cap of a little off white semi-foamy head. Barely any lace.
The aroma had some dark bittersweet chocolate roaming into stealthy woody sweet to spicy barrel with a whiff of a vanilla edge roaming into some caramel covered biscuits. Light toffee coated milk chocolate malts layer themselves into the end of the nose.
The flavor moderately presented a superb blend of a ""cool-headed"" range of bittersweet dark and milk chocolate malts playing with some caramel to biscuity sweet tastes. Subtle toffee to vanilla and woody characters grip nicely. Nice aftertaste of some pulled sweet coffee mentality to sticky caramel then nutty to toffee-ness.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. Some distracting woody spicy harshness comes about to push out the ability to take larger portions down my throat. Good carbonation and ABV. Mild spicy finish with woody dryness and caramel and a smooth blend of sweet to bitter chocolates.
Overall, the base beer is there, but becoming ""covered"" a bit as it ages. Is it me or why do people think ""barrel aged beers"" are better than their regular counterparts? Hmmmmm...I beg to differ."	4.21
5909	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Drank from a 12 fl oz (355 ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
PKG 10/16/2018
Served in a snifter. Review #1700. Shimmery, near pitch black appearance. Oily and slick on the pour and also in the glass. The liquid was topped by thin swirls of khaki colored froth. A few droplets of lacing stuck along the glass..  1,711 characters"	4.4
5910	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Delicious, high-potency stout. Sweet, roasty, syrupy pour. Had this on draft at The Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock, VT. Wished I could have brought home a bottle to age it even more. But still, the 13.4% jet fuel was definitely smooth enough.	4.5
5911	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	"Bell's Brewery ""Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged""
12 FL OZ brown glass bottle, ""PKG 10/16/2018 PRN 23038""
$7.49 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ. Notes via stream of consciousness: I guess i should have been a little more aggressive with my pour, I've only got a quarter inch of brown foam atop its black body. It's got pretty good retention though, especially given that it's 13.4% alcohol by volume. It smells of rich dark malts, Bourbon, and tobacco. There's a distinct dark chocolate note, some dark caramel syrup, and a little bit of oak. It's pretty intense and I can only imagine that it'll open up as it warms. This is one of those beers that you can almost enjoy just by sitting and smelling it - of course no one would have the will power to do that. OK, on to the flavor... it's just as intense if not more, and there are additional notes of dark fruit, hot chocolate/cocoa, molasses, and coffee to it. Everything previously noted still comes through, and the Bourbon and oak are in just the right place; sometimes there can be too much or too little. It doesn't seem that bitter and yet it's surprisingly well balanced. The alcohol helps, but it doesn't come too far forward, well, any further than you'd expect for 13.4%. Ahh, and there's that note of coconut I always find in Bourbon barrel beers. Interesting. I'd say that this is one of the best Imperial stouts on earth except that the Bourbon barrel aging almost makes it something completely different. It's impressive. In the mouth it's full bodied and slick, oily, and almost velvety but for a delicate caress from the carbonation and alcohol. I really wish I had a standard Expedition with me to taste it side by side but I didn't think of that. Oh well.
Review# 6,508"	4.76
5912	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2018 vintage. L: Black pour... oil-like with a thin brown white head. Falls fast... nice ring of lacing.. S: Chocolate, bourbon, booze, and vanilla..  592 characters	4.49
5913	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Oh this is good, and my expectations were high. Robust, chewy, viscous, edgy, boozy and smoky. Smell picks up on the robust elements first: leather, wood, coffee, smoke, molasses, then mixed in with the sweeter dark chocolate, bourbon, licorice, ginger, and then a finishing wash of wood tannins, smoke and roasted malt. Taste is more focused on the wood, bourbon and licorice immediately, then the rest of the flavors from the aroma plus a hint of vanilla, great wood throughout. Fantastic heavy stout	4.64
5914	Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged	Bottle into tulip appears black with brown head thats quick to fade. Aroma is quite fudgy out the gate smelling of chocolate, bourbon, caramel and vanilla.. Taste is smooth chocolate, caramel, oak, vanilla, toasted coconut and even almost a little marshmallow sweetness. The aftertaste is boozy bourbon, anise, earthy char to tobacco and coffee..  662 characters	4.61
5915	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Arguably the Hefeweizen that sets the standard for all others. The clove, banana, bubble gum, and lemon are all in perfect balance in the aroma as well as sip to sip. Mouthfeel is a very solid medium bodied and maybe just a tad full for the style. This is a phenomenal Weiss beer, but just be careful to avoid stale bottles and kegs on this side of the Atlantic.	4.28
5916	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.. L: Amazing. Cloudy and golden/orange. Just like you expect and WANT your wheat beers to look. Great frothy white head. Perfect example.. S: I'm not quite seasoned in smelling all of the notes like many reviewers are. I'm still very new to the craft beer game. However, banana swept right into my nose as soon as I poured it. That rarely happens for me but boy was it there on this one. Delicious!.  769 characters	4.73
5917	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	The beer poured a nice, pleasant color. The smell was a little intriguing at first, though I had never tried this type of beer before. Smelled of sharp yeast and light fruit notes, name banana. Taste was incredible — sharp yeast notes without being too sour, and a very overwhelming taste of banana. Mouthfeel was very full-bodies. Overall, excellent beer.	4.8
5918	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	If you crave a wheat beer and if it's available with other wheat choices it's definitely a pick to get or to order. Banana, clove, it's all there. But it's a tad too heavy in texture and heavy in the aftertaste. Not in a sense of beiing unpleasant or anything like that, but on a sense of lacking certain quality of freshness of a wheat grain. I guess that's why it's available year round, and the old wheat definitely adds to an old starchy ending.	4.45
5919	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"It seems a classic beer not in the ratings but also in the taste.. Perhaps it is the most balance ""Hefe-Weissbier"" beer i have try but not the best for me..
First of all this beer it has a high rate carbonation and that make it little rough in your mouth but also more heavy.. That helps you to drink it slowly because some others ""Hefe- weissbier"" is more sweet and you drink them like your orange juicy in the morning.. Also is very spicy and remind me a lot the ""Paulaner- Hefe"".. Is little more lighter and balance this one from ""Paulaner"" but is very spicy and it stick very well with your food..
The colour and the aroma is the ordinary from one ""Hefe-weissbier"".. Orange with a lot of spicy and banana aroma..
Overall a decent and classic beer to drink with your food or to go out to listen some music in some place or some live show.. Is a beer that you can drink it with your friends outside and not you can drink it alone in your house i guess.. Little spicy and little bitter for my taste but i enjoy it despite i prefer more the ""Franziskaner hefe"" on that style.."	3.9
5920	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Tried this beer at the brewery and it was great. Cloudy, full bodied, fruity aroma. Everything you want in a wheat beer. This is my wheat beer benchmark.	4.5
5921	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Exceptionally warm, easy to drink beer. Full bodied, full flavored, yet subtle enough to crush. The malts are toasty and sweet, the yeast is sharp but not sour, and the wheaty balance is exceptional. Don't waste time drinking trendy American hefes, always go German first.	4.24
5922	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Bottle pour to tall glass. Huge, dense, white head with good retention, hazy yellow color, minimal lacing. Nose of banana, yeasty. Taste is bright, wheat, bread, banana, clove. Finish is crisp. Body and carbonation are above average.	4.45
5923	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"I tried one of these on a whim while hosting a cheese and charcuterie party, figuring it'd go well with an intense three-year-old Gouda I was gifted. All I can say is WOW.. I've never been a fan of wheat beers (Canadian and American ones, anyway), but I think I ""get"" them now. Perfect balance of crispness, flavour, and visual appeal (that head, though!). Only critique for me is that the boozy nose is a bit misleading to how smooth and sweet the beer is. A new instant ""go-to"" for me, and I can't wait to get to know Bayerische beers better."	4.73
5924	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	500 ml bottle. Pours slightly hazy gold with a huge white head. Aroma of banana, cracker, clove. Taste is wheat, banana, bitter clove finish. Great summer beer. Excellent hefeweissbier, there is a reason this is considered the one to compare to.	4.27
5925	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	It was the first one served in a tasting of international beers, and it is said is one of the best of its kind, so I was pretty eager to try it. I was uninpressed by it. A good beer overall, but I expected more of it.. We tasted it in the proper glass, and it was served around 7ºC, so optimal conditions. We let it rest a couple of minutes before drinking it and it developed about 2cm of a thick white head/collar.. Charged with cereal aroma, it was too alcoholic on nose for me..  725 characters	3.61
5926	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	11.2oz bottle - no discernible date - poured into a flared pint at 44F.. Pours a fully cloudy honey golden, with three fingers of completely dense, fiamy white head, which holds its shape for several minutes.. Nose: Sweet, soft, creamy wheat grain, with an incredible classic yeast aroma - bringing an explosion of bubblegum, a hint of clove, unripe banana, and some fruity undertones atop a warm loaf of fresh bread. There's the faintest suggestion of orange rind and some mulling spice tucked in as well..  1,960 characters	4.22
5927	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Great looking with a huge fluffy head. A little bit of clove in the nose. Crisp, clean, slight banana flavor on first sips. What a wonderful Hefeweissbier!	4.5
5928	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"It being in the low 90's at the PONDerosa, today and just back from a stint at the pool, The PubScout decided to take a break from his usual IPA summer slakers and go back in time--like 1200+ years. Weihanstephaner Staatsbrauerei had hops growing near its monastery in 768 AD. And seeing a lonely bottle of this classic wheat beer in the back of my fridge, I decided to try to resurrect the reactions I had when first I tasted this incredible beer decades--not centuries--ago, no matter what Paul Z. says.
I was first impressed back then by the banana-clove-bubblegum notes so very evident in the nose and on the palate. A crisp spiciness could also be detected with a bit of concentration, as well.
Great news! This is still the same wonderful wheat (at least 50%) beer that rocked my beer world back when hazy, juicy IPA's were not even on the radar.
And, with the temps soaring today, it was the perfect beer--smooth, medium mouthfeel, no bitter hop dominance and just a most refreshing, extraordinarily drinkable beer. Its low ABV (5.4%) makes it most sessionable, and I'd imagine it would pair well with anything except game meats and chocolate desserts.
If those Juicy Haze-bombs ever run their course (and they likely will), millennials and everyone else might benefit by going ""Back to the Future,"" and discovering what a classic, refreshing summer beer is supposed to taste like. Everything old may well be new again."	4.6
5929	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	This was possibly the best beer I have ever had. I had two full Maßkrugs of this beer at the German American Cultural Society of Rhode Island's Sommerfest event. It was on tap, and was just perfect. It had a cloudy amber look to it and a clean, fresh, refreshing flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this beer.	4.87
5930	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Ooo. Expanding my horizons here. I’ve tried a good few hefe’s Of the American variety so was happy to find this highly rated Bavarian style, from the world’s oldest brewery no less (they must be doing something right by now!). Look and smell were enjoyable but the taste is heavy - almost oily, this lends itself to a nice full mouthfeel, but I prefer brighter/cleaner/crisper to date.	3.84
5931	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"My review from the beer on the grounds IN FREISING. Maybe at some point when the IPA fad dies down the Germans will start shipping in CANS and shipping with expeditiousness. This is the definition of summer beer. No orange required.
You alter the reinheitsgebot for a beer-this one-you know something is right.
If you can find a GUTMANN von TITTING, it's the only one that beats this."	5
5932	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	This is beer. Admittedly had never heard of this ancient brewery after drinking Schneider and son for many years. This is my first review and this hefe was so good it compelled me to join the advocate.. Smooth bright cloudy golden glow aromatic yeasty with that slight bannana/clove flavor and sharp pinpoint carbonation. Every sip trying to find any imperfection was met with perfect balance of all characteristics again and again.	5
5933	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"500 mL Bottle. ABV 5.4%.
Appearance: Straw/Gold, Two fingers of white head, Hazy, Medium carbonation.
Aroma: Banana, Clove, Bready malts, Slight spice.
Mouthfeel: Under medium body, Soft, Almost creamy, Good carbonation,
Flavour: Banana, Slight spice, Bready malts, Bubblegum, Slightly floral.
Overall: Simply fantastic. Impeccably balanced. I've heard about this beer for a while, and it is a beer I would love to have in the fridge at all times. Wow."	4.46
5934	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Simply put: This beer is superb. This is one of the best beers on the planet, bar none. I don’t believe I’ve ever heard or read a negative review of this particular company. They get it right on all of their styles. The taste, the feel, everything. A truly exceptional example of a perfectly brewed beer, not just for its style, IN GENERAL. This is one to keep in your fridge always.	4.99
5935	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	An absolutey superb beer, and one of my favourites. I lived in Berlin for 3 years and this was considered an expensive beer at the beer shop, about euro1.50/500ml. One of my favourite German beers... until I tried Weihenstephaner Vitus which continues to further knock me for six+ (in my Top-10 of 400+ beers). Still, Vitus is something truly special, meanwhile this one makes a wonderful superb weekly treat.. This time enjoyed at the much more expensive Brauhaus in Singapore. S$16 for a 500ml bottle.	4.01
5936	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	L: Pours a slightly cloudy yellow gold color with a very large creamy white head that dissipates rather slowly and just a bit of lacing on the glass.. S: Cloves, banana, a hint of pepper, and wheat and baked bread all mix together to create a very inviting aroma.. T: Clove, pepper, banana, and baked wheat bread all mix together to make a smooth and easy drinking beer, a slight bitterness..  468 characters	4.4
5937	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"L: opaque rich gold with a nice white head, somewhat like an IPA
S: banana and faint pepper, typical of Weihenstephaner
T: spike of black pepper, pleasant
F: excellent carbonation and mouthfeel"	4.2
5938	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	Absolutely shocked that I had never reviewed this one before, as I consider it a (the?) defining example of the style.. Golden color, somewhat cloudy. Pours a monster head, creamy and lingering.. Almost a pilsner like spicy note on the nose initially. A soft, slightly sweet and clove nose as it warms a bit. Slight hint of a sweeter fruity banana kind of aroma..  810 characters	4.46
5939	Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier	"500ml brown bottle. Date code of '5278 18:42:42'.
Clear gold colored body, until the final bit of the pour introduced some cloudiness. Two finger off white head which sticks around a thick creamy cap. Leaves behind some sheets of lacing.
Aroma of banana and cloves, along with the wheat. There is a lot of yeast expressing here too.
Sweet taste with a bit of the tangy wheat. Lots of banana and cloves. Bubblegum to rubber yeast.
Fuller mouth feel, and very creamy and smooth. Very good carbonation.
This beer has the classic expression (looks, smell and flavor) of its style, and is most excellent."	4.46
5940	Darkstar November	2017 Bottle opened with a couple fellow BA members. Would put this ahead of many of the BA stouts I have consumed this year by a large margin. Thick fudge brownie. It was still a bit warming, so I imagine it may have been quite hot when fresh.	4.79
5941	Darkstar November	The molasses in this beer adds some leveled sweetness and complexity to an already superb mouthfeel. Great depth and a delicious beer that many don’t give proper due.	4.5
5942	Darkstar November	"L: Light shade of darkness. Much more brown than black
S: Extremely sweet molasses.
T: Extremely light dark beer notes. Very sweet and most of the dank, darkness is massed.
F: A kiss of darkness that fades into sweatness.
O: A very light and sweet dark beer that hides it's powerful 14%."	4.21
5943	Darkstar November	2014 Edition, bottle #114.. Black pour at 54 degrees with grey/ruby edges when held up to the light; fizzy grayish tan head with some retention of swirls of micro dot bubbles/cap; solid ring, sudsy lacing; medium thick legs. Chocolate, coconut, molasses, rye nose; bourbon on exhale. Bourbon, molasses, rye, chocolate, oak, vanilla, dark stone fruits - cherries and plums; caramel malt sweetness as liquid warms; molasses finish. Velvety smooth, medium full feel with a dry tongue coating; moderate minus carbonation; face flushing warmth from 13.7%. Overall, very satisfying; no oxidation or off flavors on this 4 1/2 years old stout; the bourbon/barrel notes are somewhat subdued but present; the rye drys the tongue, but not aggressively; nice balance of semi sweet malt and fruit with barrel flavors; tasty long molasses linger; World Class!	4.67
5944	Darkstar November	"550ml bottle poured into a snifter
2017 Vintage. A- pours deep black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki colored head that reduces to leave a ring around the edge. S- bold barrel aromas up front with notes of wet oak and barrel juice, peppery rye adds some spicy elements, sweet notes of chocolate, caramel, fudge brownies, molasses, figs and vanilla cream.  876 characters"	4.49
5945	Darkstar November	Tasted from bottle. Just a perfectly done BA stout. Pours black with beige head. Aroma of molasses, bourbon, caramel, maple. Thick and chewy. Moderately to heavily sweet. Flavor with lots of molasses and caramel, chocolate, bourbon. Excellent.	4.79
5946	Darkstar November	2018 bottle poured into a snifter. Opaque dark brown color with a modest but persistent tan head. Rich bourbon, maple, and chocolate on the nose. Smelled decadent, and the taste was more so. Thick but not overly sweet. A rich serving of barrel, vanilla, chocolate, and enough maple to punctuate it, but not dominate. Warm but not overly boozy on the finish. Worthy of its reputation.	4.45
5947	Darkstar November	"Had on tap at Hollingshead Deli during latest Orange County CA “Beer Safari”.
Met the hype and more. Outstanding BAIS... rye barely and molasses stand outs. Beautiful beer with exceptional smooth body and feel. Just one of those very special beers. These guys can cook!"	4.6
5948	Darkstar November	It is truly delicious. A little bit foamy, the foam spilled a little.. Look: Black with an inch thick mocca colored head.. Aroma: wonderful aroma of sweet raisin rye bread and bourbon.  281 characters	4.59
5949	Darkstar November	"This is the 2018 edition. Had on tap at the source.
L: Pours pitch black. Chestnut ring around the edge of glass. Viscous looking with minimal residual lacing.
S: Molasses is abundant on the nose, followed by bourbon. Notes of black licorice, dark fruits, caramel, toffee and malts also detectible. Smells complex and fantastic.
T: Molasses-forward. I love that I pick up the rye character on the flavor, adding an additional depth to the complexity. Finish is bourbon heat with lingering malt/molasses flavor. Moderate bitterness with the perfect pinch of sweetness to round it out.
F: The most disappointing aspect. Somewhat thin and light in bodied. Carbonation was appropriate but it didn't have the weight I love in other BL offerings.
O: A damn good brew. Masks the abv well and I would definitely try again. I am glad to have tried. Cheers!"	4.26
5950	Darkstar November	Wow! Having at a share right after I had Damon from Hill Farmstead and I think I like this better. Very marshmallows mouthfeel. Pours so dark with a great head. Delicious!	5
5951	Darkstar November	Wow, baby, talk to me. Hey, baby, want me... This beer 100% is the hot girl at the club, gym, and goat Yoga. Everyone wants her. Deep, luscious, bold stout essences with heavy, yet smooth chocolate that make a playa want to scream for dayyyzzzzzz	4.48
5952	Darkstar November	Had on tap. Dark, brooding and smooth. Pour jet black and viscous with slight brown foam that quickly dissipates. Has a bitter bite to awaken the drinker from the smooth and tranquil body. Molasses and rye bitters combine with the bourbon, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate and licorice sweetness to make a full flavor complexion. Smell is bourbon and rye forward.	4.44
5953	Darkstar November	11/17/18 (Chicago): 2 oz 14.1% ABV pour at FOBAB into taster glass. Black pour, thin tan lacing. Malt, chocolate and coconut aroma, whiskey faint. Chocolate and whiskey the predominate taste, light coconut, balanced. Creamy mouth feel, smooth. Overall very good offering!	4.25
5954	Darkstar November	"500 ml bottle from 2017. Poured into tulip. Pours a dark, dark brown (I can’t say that it’s black), finely bubbled creamy tan head, recedes to just a fine inner ring.
The aroma is molasses, bourbon, milk chocolate.
Taste matches the nose. Chocolate, roast, molasses, rye spice, bourbon, touch of heat. Lingering vanilla, and just a hint of marshmallow. Pretty sweet for a RIS but I’m not knock it down for that. How could I? It’s too good.
Thick, rich and chewy. Slick with light carbonation washing it down.
Another top notch beer from a top notch brewery."	4.54
5955	Darkstar November	This tastes a lot like sour black licorice. It is single a dimension. I hate it so much. Why age this trainwreck? There are too many other good beers that would be improved by barrel ageing, this makes a hunk of shit almost tolerable.	3.34
5956	Darkstar November	Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Bottle Logic can glass. Acquired in a trade.. Pours a deep brown body with a small light brown head that reduces quickly to leave a ring of retention and no lacing.. Aromas are deep and inviting with tons of bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate, caramel, light booziness, molasses, rye spices, vanilla beans in the background..  845 characters	4.66
5957	Darkstar November	Dark brown color with tan head. Aroma is boozy, malty and whiskey forward. Taste is bittersweet, earthy, woody with lots of whiskey and dry finish with lots of roasty bitterness. Medium body with low carbonation. Quite good but a bit harsh on the bitterness and booze.	4.4
5958	Darkstar November	Received in a trade. Batch 2016 and review #3300. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice rich dark motor oil black with a good almost two finger dark chocolate mocha head that fades nice and slowly to leave a thin blanket. Very, very nice legs as well.. S - Aromas of chocolate fudge brownies, cookie dough, vanilla, nice barrel presence, rich and slightly sweet bourbon and caramel..  1,119 characters	4.53
5959	Darkstar November	My favorite beer. So complex and nicely balanced. The Molasses just gives such a nice texture to this beer that you just don't see in others. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Perfection.	5
5960	Darkstar November	On tap. Good amount of rye, spice. So much sweet bourbon and vanilla-oak on the nose. Lots of vanilla, bourbon and oak, milk chocolate, and soft/silky smooth heat. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, not overly syrupy. Yhis is a great staright up imperial russian bourbon barrel-aged stout. I will say it lacks some bitterness. More sweet than bitter.	4.42
5961	Darkstar November	Pours a viscous, black motor oil with thin mocha head.. Smells of caramel, molasses, a bit of vanilla. Taste has bourbon, chocolate, burnt sugar.  199 characters	4.39
5962	Darkstar November	pours out black with a dark tan head that is creamy and hangs around for a few minutes, great looking!. aromas are whiskey, spicy booze, molasses, leather, hint of dark fruits.. has a definite boozy spice to it, big molasses and burnt sugar quality. dark fruits coming through, plum, raisin, and cherry perhaps. there is dark roasty malts, a deep oaky quality, some mellow barrel sweetness, caramel and a touch of vanilla, char, and a mellow bitterness. overall this was good but didnt taste much barrel character.	4.23
5963	Darkstar November	Tried from the bottle at Ladyface 8th Anniversary Invitational. 1/21/18.. Pours like motor oil, with a nice tan head of foam.. Boozy! Dark fruit, roasty, and full of bourbon, caramel, and molasses on the nose..  418 characters	4.31
5964	Darkstar November	With the spice of rye and the savory sweetness of molasses, the mad scientists at Bottle Logic come up with a nonlogical ale that doesn't make any sense outside of wowing the palate with utter indulgence.. Pitch black and quickly thwarting any meaningful foam, the stout quickly looks like tar sitting in the glass, but with slight tawny bronze edged and legging. Decadence ensues with the very first scent of dark chocolate, whisky, espresso and molasses. Just as the booze tingles the nose with a tangy peppery sensation, its lavishly malted taste glides onto the middle palate with a dense cakey taste and texture.. Along the middle palate, the beer's reckless malt sweetness latches tightly onto each and every tastebud and endures the session easily. Meanwhile the complex flavors of bittersweet chocolate, black walnut, rich espresso and slightly burnt brownies give the session a pastry-like taste and texture. Molasses brings a kiss of butterscotch along with savory, complex and robust charm that melds seamlessly with the oaken character of whisky, coconut, caramel and vanilla late on the palate..  1,507 characters	4.5
5965	Blanc De Blancs	Acts exactly like champagne. Foams up immediately, recedes quickly, bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass. Crazy musty aromas, with a Moscato-like sweetness. Between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas, the jaw-aching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock. The 10% is front and center with tons of white wine, funk, barrel, and a dry as a bone finish.	4.05
5966	Blanc De Blancs	Burnt amber with a fizzy head that dies instantly to an almost still surface but for a light effervescence coming up in the center.. Moderate woody funk that brings both a little blue cheese and walnut underlies super sharply sour grapefruit and white grape that's somewhat vinegary, like a mango balsamic. The crisp medium-light body finishes paper dry with a little floral bitterness coming out on the exhale.. Another overly SOUR Side Project bottle.	3.97
5967	Blanc De Blancs	Copper colored, hazy, and with no real head. The aroma is of very forward oak and chardonnel grapes. I'm tasting the chardonnel grapes, oak, and very tart microflora. There's nothing subtle about the aggressiveness of the flavors here. The mouth is bone dry, lightly acidic, and offers moderate carbonation.	4.26
5968	Blanc De Blancs	Aroma is complex and very, very intense in aroma. Super funky aroma with breadiness, grape must etc. It's quite spectacular. Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that.. Overall this is quite the exceptional beer, but I think the high ABV and high acidity and sour lean it a tad too extreme and not subtle complex enough.	4.71
5969	Blanc De Blancs	Thanks to Harrison8 for this one. Blend 2. 12oz bottle poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a cloudy straw yellow color with a head of tight, white bubbles that were dissipating quickly as the beer poured. In fact, there was no head left even as I finished the pour. Obviously, there was no lacing. But, the sound of the effervescence from the carbonation was amazing. i could hear the beer from arms length.. The aroma was a pleasantly confusing mixture of grains, yeast, funk, some floral notes (hops?), grapes, and maybe some oak? Wutever, there was plenty of goodness going on.. On the tongue, similar scenario: so much going on, it's hard to describe. Every sip gives a different perspective. some very nice tartness..  949 characters	4.15
5970	Blanc De Blancs	Batch 2 bottle purchased at Side Project The Cellar.. Deep saturated clear yellow appearance. Foam dissipates very quickly and none is left after as you drink. Big barnyard funk aroma. Some of that is also present in the taste but additionally a good bit of sour grapes and mild lemon. Medium acidity and tartness. Medium mouthfeel.	4.13
5971	Blanc De Blancs	Straw yellow color, no head or retention, but a nice mild carbonation. Smell is rich of floral, musty fruit. Sweet, long finish is mildly acidic. Awesome	4.7
5972	Blanc De Blancs	A soured biere de champgne, well this is a first! Love both style, and this hybrid is a winner too. Nic champagne yeast and malt base with succulent sour grape, bright flowers, and dry white wine and oak finish. Goes from dry, to wet, to back to dry, with each switch unlocking new flavors. Smell has more of a musk and yeast center, but very spring like and pleasant. Touch of cumulative acidity and sneaky carbonation.	4.44
5973	Blanc De Blancs	=2018 release (batch 2).. A: Pours a pale orangish with no head or lacing. Decently hazy.. S: Moderate oak, sweet white wine, light barrel char, vanilla and cardamom, light earth and barnyard. Balanced toward the oak..  710 characters	4.36
5974	Blanc De Blancs	This was outstanding. Had 4 SP fruits in a night and this was the clear favorite. Massive wine grape, mildly tart. Not overwhelmingly sour. Unreal this was 10%. Hides ABV well.	4.66
5975	Blanc De Blancs	Bottle into a tasting glass, reviewed from notes. Thanks Aaron!. A: Hazy deep gold body under a finger of white froth. Mediocre retention and lacing, which is better than I expected for the style. Pretty nice.. S: Intense. Huge citric acidity is front and center, with waves of lemon, lime, grapeskin, and passionfruit. Some sweeter grape and melon notes emerge as it warms, as well as more than a hint of vanilla oak. Excellent..  940 characters	4.52
5976	Blanc De Blancs	Grapes, white wine and a little funkiness to the aroma. A little more sourness to the taste up front with the dry, tart grapes shining in the finish. Great beer overall, grapes were really well done and complimenting.	4.58
5977	Blanc De Blancs	Though this drinks more like a wine it still keeps a beer under structure. Tart white grapes, champagne like dryness and sweetness, earthy vinous notes and a nice apricot make this so good.	4.5
5978	Blanc De Blancs	Much thanks to a good friend for sharing his bottle with me a few weeks ago. Enjoyed out of a green 375 mL bottle but I was not able to catch the bottling date (if there was one). Poured into a small Belgian-style tulip glass.. Appearance (4.5) - Pours a hazy golden color that reminds me of the color of an egg yolk, but with more notes of orange and amber going on than what you'd expect. The head is about a finger at most and a fairly stark/snow white in color. It doesn't last long before fading to a ringlet around the edges of the glass and just a faint swirl of foam across the surface of the liquid.. Smell (4.5) - There are a few key elements present which all combine quite nicely. Of course, there is a fantastic lactic acidity that makes my tastebuds pucker slightly in anticipation before ever taking a sip. But alongside that, the vinous characteristics of white wine and oak, with even perhaps a hint of vanilla. And finally, there is a subtle hint of white grape tartness that is different in nature from the bacteria-based sourness that is clearly present. It adds a depth to the sourness that might not be there without the fruit. I can't wait to dive into this and drink it..  2,333 characters	4.6
5979	Blanc De Blancs	Nice oaky chardonnay aroma, but far too acetic in the taste. And while it raised a nice head, in doing so it seemed to lose most of it's carbonation leaving the beer somewhat flat by the time of drinking.	3.52
5980	Blanc De Blancs	375 mL bottle poured into a snifter.. Appearance - Hazy orange body. Small white head. Thin collar.. Smell - Lots of grape. Musty. White wine is strong. Acidic and woody..  426 characters	4.07
5981	Blanc De Blancs	375ml bottle. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass 3/4/2015.. A- Clear light orange-copper body, one finger white head with fair retention time, not much lacing. Nice thin collar that sticks around the entire time.. S- Lactic acid, clean wheat and pale malt presence, but definitely a lot of oak and lactic acid. The grapes don't come out as much until it warms up, but it's definitely there. White grape must, not much grape juice in terms of the aroma, but that's expected. A little bit of funk, but the lacto is definitely stronger, as is the theme with all of the Side Project wild ales..  1,402 characters	4.59
5982	Blanc De Blancs	Thanks to Augzilla for sharing this one at Oneinchaway's tasting.. Pours a murky golden-yellow with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour with grain, wine grape, white wine, wood, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, fruit, white wine, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great white wine barrel aged characteristics all around.. Serving type: bottle.	4.16
5983	Blanc De Blancs	Pours a rich golden color with a bright effervescent head that recedes quickly. Smell is lemon, citrus, stone fruit, funk, yogurt. Taste is essentially like a light white sparkling wine with tart yogurt intermixed. Lots of white grape, peach, apple, pear with a creamy yogurty sourness. Really tastes like a fruit on the bottom yogurt cup. The mouthful is rich and creamy while the carbonation keeps it light. Outstanding beer. My biggest issue with Fuzzy is that the subtle sweetness of the white peaches were drowned out by the intense yogurty sourness. Blueberry Flanders had a nice balanced refreshing tartness but the blueberry flavor was a bit disappointing. This is a much better balance for my taste than both, a best of both worlds. Probably my favorite SP so far. Get it today!	4.86
5984	Blanc De Blancs	A wonderful aroma on this one of big lemony tart qualities, almost a plastic funk.. The flavor however is slightly overwhelming of lemony tart, which has been a problem Fuzzy as well. Despite that, a good complexity of tart with some yogurt tart qualities as well. White grapes up front on the finish.. Very surprised that the ABV is so darn high for what it drinks like. However, generally covered by too much tart qualities and I much preferred JK's Blanc du Bois in a side by side.	4.26
5985	Blanc De Blancs	A- Pours a bright, medium straw golden in color. A small, one finger head forms and dissipates quickly down to a trace of bubbles around the edges of the glass. The body of the beer is nearly entirely clear. The lacing is minimal with the lack of a prominent head.. S- Starts off with a mild to somewhat assertive white grape fruitiness on the nose. Just a touch of crisp tartness is present in the scent, but the chardonels really shine through here. The scent displays a little bit of grapey sweetness, but not a whole lot. My overall impression of the smell is that of a slightly tart, off-dry chardonel, that has just a touch of funky dryness at the very end.. T- Starts off by assaulting the tongue with fairly aggressive punch of juicy sour flavor. The grape fruit flavors take a back seat to the overall sour flavor, although the tartness is derived out of the fruit. In the middle of the drink, the sourness becomes somewhat acidic and very reminiscent of a War Heads candy. After the peak of the sour flavor, a touch of funkiness creeps in and gives more of a grainy flavor underneath the tartness. Dryness from the barrel is detectable at the end of the drink, although the prominent flavor is still juicy and somewhat fruity tartness..  1,874 characters	4.55
5986	Blanc De Blancs	The beer pours a dull sunset like golden yellow with no head, visible carbonation, and (with some careful pouring) no sediment. The nose has a slightly floral/vanilla grain & barrel sweetness, surprisingly limited tartness, underlying grape notes, and minimal funk/acetone. It has a mild, champagne-like grape taste upfront with grain rounding out profile and lingering alcohol and oak. The beer has a light-medium body, but is not as crushable as expected (mainly due to the alcohol content) and a slightly chewy sweetness. Carbonation is relatively low and acidity is lower than expected - the beer still finishes with that punishing dry oak slap in the palate. The beer's so limited and expensive that I'd probably avoid purchasing it again in the future (or at least my full allotment), but it's undeniably delicious.	4.4
5987	Blanc De Blancs	375ml bottle poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass.. The beer pours a golden color, hues of oranges and yellows, very hazy with a fizzy head, barely a finger, white color with low retention and just a spot or two of lace. The aroma is of strong white wine, champagne, sour grapes, tart apples, lemon citrus, funky yeast and oak, quite acetic as well. The flavors are really sharply sour, vinous grapes, lemon citrus, green apples, really bitingly sour, funk and oak come out as well, but boy was this sour. The mouthfeel is nice, very carbonated, bubbly, coats the mouth very well, finishes dryly and a bit sharply, but with a light warming sensation from the alcohol.. Verdict: A very interesting beer from Side Project. Much like Fuzzy, the nose was immaculate, capturing the perfect essence of chardonnay grapes and white wine, but the flavors are crippled by how sour the beer is and while enjoyable, difficult to handle more than a few ounces. The ABV was expertly hidden, which was a nice touch, but still, the overwhelming acidic sourness is hard to get past.	4.26
5988	Blanc De Blancs	"While waiting in line to get my allotment, I purchased one for onsite consumption, drank today and poured into a wine stem glass.. A - bright yellowy orange lemony color with a 2 finger white foam head that slowly dissipates. This one has some light legs when stirred and quaffed. Reminds me of du ble but a little brighter.. S - Smell is tart funky lemony citrus burst with a chardonnay wine smell followed by the chardonel grapes. These were the same grapes used in Savant Blanc as well as ""J'eaux Deau from Upright..  1,494 characters"	4.81
5989	Mastermind	Draft pour at Fiddlehead - drank on 7/12/2019. A bit boozy and sharp - certainly not soft like your contemporary NE IPAs. A bit yeasty. Still, super tasty.	4.25
5990	Mastermind	One week old can poured into a wide jar glass. Remarkable light in color - an extremely hazy golden haze.. Very pineapple on the nose - almost a bit like the aroma you get from snapping the stem off of a fruit before skinning and chopping. Some more citrus and rind characters pop out as it warms.. Very fruity - melon, orange juice, and a slightly underripe pineapple. Semi-dry - not a bitter finish at all..  601 characters	4.03
5991	Mastermind	A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing. S: Citrus and pine up front along with lighter floral notes and some malt. T: Follows the nose. Starts off with some citrusy hops and moderate bitterness. Picks up some pine and floral notes as well as a balancing maltiness. Finishes with lingering citrus.  562 characters	4.44
5992	Mastermind	Appearance - Pours bright opaque yellow with a thin white head settles to a rocky ring. No lacing.. Aroma - Nose is orange, earthy herbal hops, grapefruit. Taste - Taste is mostly orange nice balanced sweetness and light bitterness. Grassy hops and pineapple come out well, taste is sweeter than the nose let's on..  530 characters	4.31
5993	Mastermind	Canned 6/6/19, drank 7/5/19. Can has notation, “HarrisMillis”. Is this pineapple juice or a beer? Sweet, drinkable, super cloudy, pineapple juice colored and opaque like pineapple juice also. Would be nicer with more head. My first from fiddlehead and it won’t be my last!Thanks Warnerry!	4.55
5994	Mastermind	"Traded for this beer a while ago, as it had the date of 6/24/16 on the bottom of the can with ""C U @ SPAC"" written underneath that. Unlike many of the beers that I've had in my cellar that I'm finally getting around to, this didn't hold up that well and I'm sure it would be a zillion times better fresh. I still vowed to review everything that I'm going through and this certainly won't be an exception to that rule!. Not crazy about the pour to this as the liquid was golden, topped with plenty of fast settling head, and left behind enough rings of lacing as I worked my way through this. A bit of sediment could be seen in the liquid but it wasn't as much as I would have originally thought. Both the aroma and taste were a mess here - skunked Citra, weed, Caramel Malt, urine, and evergreen made me feel like I walked in on a Phish concert (and no, I don't listen to them). Just too much going on here and not in a good way, as this felt heavy and old on the palate with not enough carbonation to keep things light.... Plenty of booze here and this felt much more stronger than it was an actuality. Someday, I'll get a new can of this and give it another go. For tonight, it was just another reminder of how I have more beer in this house than I can possibly keep up with..."	3.2
5995	Mastermind	Canned 8/19/16; drank 8/27/16 @ the Yarchives.. Drank straight from the can; no visual cues.. This smells like Orange Crush (the soda)..  262 characters	2.92
5996	Mastermind	"Serving: Can
Canned: Apr-3-2019 (Consumed Apr-19). A:
Pours a cloudy white gold with a finger of white head that settles to a film. Speckled lacing, okay retention. (4). S:
Guava, grapefruit, some green hoppy vegetal bite. (4).  944 characters"	4.08
5997	Mastermind	Canned on 2/21/19. Pours a deeply hazy dulled lemon gold topped with a finger or so of creamy white head; retention is very good, and results in a thin plastering of consistent lacing all around the glass, as well as a light collar of foam.. Aroma presents big notes of smooth herbal sweetness with a light citric touch; bits of orange zest, passionfruit, lemon/lime, and something resembling dank aloe tones; unique, in-your-face, but very appealing and smooth..  1,265 characters	4.25
5998	Mastermind	"12 oz. Can version.
""Lay it Down"" 12/07/18
Opened on 12/19/18. Poured out into my heady Treehouse long stemmed IPA glass looking like a milky gold color. A straw golden color with a deep white haze....opaque, but lemmony.... you get the gist. Light and thick!
Creamy foam, with a whipped look, sticky-icky lacing all around. clumps or islands of foam float about like they own the place. The lacing is intricate and abundant.. Dude.. come on! The aroma or nose is unlike any other. Creamy lactose hoppy milkshake! It seriously smells like a hoppy creamsicle. Dense and sweet Mandarin oranges, banana, Fluff and a light golden malt thing combines to make a crazy, smelly and pungent aroma..  1,181 characters"	4.51
5999	Mastermind	Hazy really pale yellow color with white head. Aroma has dank and earthy hop notes with some slightly spicy malt notes. Taste is grassy and herbal with a medium bitterness and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Quite good but not really up to the hype.	4
6000	Mastermind	"A: Yellow, cloudy, white head, not murky yeast slurry!
S: Huge pineapple, grapefruit, malt sweetness, tangerine, juicy fruit
T: Pineapple, bitter grapefruit, light malt sweetness, hidden alcohol, orange peel
M: Medium with light balanced carbonation
O: Does an incredible job of conveying the good parts of a ""hazy"" double ipa (appearance, juicy, balanced bitterness, lightly creamy mouthfeel) while also having the best parts of a straightforward great ipa (malt, no yeast burn, hop driven). One of the best double IPAs I've had in a long time and I could drink multiple cans of this"	4.49
6001	Mastermind	Poured from a 12 oz can into an Alesmith tulip. L: Cloudy golden pour. 2 fingers of foamy white head leave a great deal of lacing.. S; Grapefruit and citrus... tropical fruits. Juicy..  450 characters	4.41
6002	Mastermind	"Look: Yellow hazy with medium white head. Has low carbonation.
Smell: Citrus, pineapple, dank resin, and melon.
Taste: Citrus, pineapple, dank resin, and melon.
Mouthfeel: Medium and very smooth.
Overall: An excellent IPA from fiddlehead."	4.72
6003	Mastermind	Pours a hazy gold with a very fluffy three finger head. That head lasts for quite a while before breaking. Excellent lacing.. Smell is citrusy, with tropical fruits and a strong malt backbone.. Taste is like the nose, citrusy and tropical now with a tiny amount of piney. A strong malt presence is also quite noticable..  609 characters	4.27
6004	Mastermind	Nothing too intense going on here (regular brownish mostly yellow pour, regular bitterness, regular booze flavor), but perhaps a little light on the flavor overall.	3.23
6005	Mastermind	Can dated 10/16/17 into pint glass. Pours a hazy yellowish-amber with an off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Initial impression is juicy citrus, caramel, tropical fruit, pineapple, and a slight pine-y hops bitterness. Very smooth, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is quite hefty; carbonation is on the light side. Finish is sweet fading to a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very, very well done.	4.28
6006	Mastermind	Smooth, fruity with a great subtle bite throughout the front and back end flavor. Tried the flagship IPA and their oat/wheat IPA as well in the taproom this weekend, and this one blows them both away by a mile. Love this.	4.44
6007	Mastermind	Cloudy straw color with moderate white head that desipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of citrus. Taste is a nice balance of hoppy and citrus that is very smooth.	4.52
6008	Mastermind	This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a hazy burnt grapefruit yellow to orange color. The head dissipated immediately leaving some messy sticky lacing clinging to the glass. The smell started off with juicy grapefruit leaning towards the pulp side. Bitterness comes from the pine and has a slight underscore of citrus rind to balance. The taste reels in the sweet grapefruit and brings about a nice settling clean bitter sticky pine. The aftertaste is quick, sharp and light grapefruit with a crisp finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a clean crisp sticky grapefruit and slightly resinous feel coating my tongue. Overall, this was an extremely well done DIPA that I would love to have again.	4.52
6009	Mastermind	Poured a beautifully bright and only slightly cloudy yellow with a full head of nice white foam. Aromas and flavors are bursting with pineapple qualities: it truly tastes like biting into a fresh, sweet tropical pineapple while on the beach of an island paradise. For a beer that doesn't have any added fruits or juices, this is the most pineapple flavor I've ever encountered in a brew; it's not cloying or too sweet though. There's some bitterness on the back end of the creamy and lightly effervescent mouthfeel. Just wonderful.	4.75
6010	Mastermind	Beautiful cloudy yellow-orange body. Thin white head.. Nose is hop encrusted pineapple.. Flavor continues the pineapple associations. Sharp, crisp, fruity, creamy, biting. Just a delicious glass of happiness..  523 characters	4.68
6011	Mastermind	Can into a snifter appears a hazy pale golden yellow color with a white cap that fades leaving spotty lace.. Aroma is like sticking your nose into a bag of pelletized hops that have been open awhile. Herbal, citrusy and with a hefty cheese-like stank to it.. Taste is like lemony drop candy with a cereal-like grain freshness/sweetness to the finish. Some of that cheese-like hop flavor is present before finishing with lemon pledge cleaner..  498 characters	3.84
6012	Mastermind	Beautifully done. Very bright and smooth hop forward IPA by Fiddlehead. Had a great amount of tropical fruits and smooth taste. Nice golden yellow look as well.	4.43
6013	Mastermind	White head. Hazy straw yellow. Lots of lace left.. Lots of tropical fruits here, Mango, papaya, and orange. Grapefruit and some melon flavors. Earthy and green, but a nice, soft feel with minimal bitterness.. The first sip I didn't think was crazy good, but as it warmed all the good flavors came out. This was a really awesome and really impressed me. Very incredible dipa.	4.5
6014	Double Orange Starfish	Fortunate enough to try this out at a bottle share at Hoof Hearted outside of Columbus OH. Very well-balanced showcase of Citra hops with orange and some bitterness. Excellent and would love to have this again at some point down the road.	4.5
6015	Double Orange Starfish	Very good, hazy,I would not recommend drinking from the can as they leave a small yeast cake in the bottom. Pour into a glass slowly an don,t pour the last half inch into the glass or the yeast goes in and destroys the beer, and result is nasty-ruining the beer. Also very pricey. There are other better choices for that kind of money	4.24
6016	Double Orange Starfish	One to be remembered. Citrus. thick-bodied with that NE-style haze appearance we have all started to know and love. This beer is one of the better IPA's I've had in a while	4.79
6017	Double Orange Starfish	"L - Hazy golden/orange with a creamy white head that somewhat sticks around but leaves behind a ton of lacing.
S - Piney hops along with a decent amount of citrus and orange notes. The pine dominates on the nose, but there's also a sweetness from the oranges.
T - Piney bitter hops up front and throughout along with notes of sweet orange and citrus - but the citrus definitely is more on the sweeter side than bitter. Some other tropical notes in there as well such as pineapple.
F - Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, creamy.
O - Incredibly well balanced NEIPA with great hop and citrus flavors."	4.5
6018	Double Orange Starfish	Traded for this a while ago, but the date on the bottom of the can was not completely legible so I have no idea how old this was when I cracked it open on this hot night! Saw the lofty rating for this and even though this can wasn't fresh, this was as big and enjoyable a juice bomb that I've had in quite some time, and easily one of the best New England IPA's that I've ever been able to review here at the house!. Good pour to this as the liquid looked like pure orange juice, with just a bit of a darker hue to it. Enough head topped this off but that didn't translate to the lacing as the bubbles were only seen near the top of my pint glass once I started to work my way through this. Loads of orange, tangerine, vanilla cream, garlic, scallions, and tropical fruits in the nose as the juiciness really burst through in the taste. Slick, smooth, and sweet, there was an underlying hint of spice that livened things up and complemented the initial taste that hit my palate and somehow, it worked! Candied citrus and an underlying dankness rounded things out as this beer didn't stay in my pint glass for very long!. The amount of alcohol in this was spot-on as it was present, but hardly felt, with all of the flavors complementing each other quite nicely to go along with the moderate carbonation. A juice bomb if there ever was one, this was more than one-dimensional and left me wanting more. In the end, isn't that what any good beer should have as it's parting shot?	4.43
6019	Double Orange Starfish	"Personally, I was disappointed with the regular Orange Starfish, but figured this beer was worth a try based on the accolades. Yup. It's good. Nice sweet fruit on the nose and tongue, and a very creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced as well. Seems more like 6.7% than 8.3%. Little bit of papaya and powdered sugar. Not as good as a few of their beers (Grovestand), but better than most (Dunley Place). I wish this really was their ""standard"" beer and they worked variations from here instead of putting out a lot of hit or miss beers."	4.33
6020	Double Orange Starfish	"Purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA, second or third batch I've tried.
Served in a Pilsner Urquell glass brought back from Berlin in 1987!. Hazy, cloudy, nearly opaque view poured hard and yielded a small bubble froth that stays as you drink. Full lacing sticks on the glass.
This is a fruit bomb but all very balanced and a legendary double version of their killer OS. I absolutely LOVE what Aslin is doing with so many of their beers, experimenting and pushing the envelope. This is closer to what I'd refer to as a ""clean"" NE Hazy IPA but with great flavors.. Big hops prevalent but not all mixed up, straight at you. This is both Orange Juice and a mix of tropical fruit, all blended perfectly with no sense that you are getting hammered with this 8.3% DIPA! You'll never confuse this with a Lawson's but I really love what Aslin is doing with all the flavor mixes and they obviously obsessed with making great beer..  1,170 characters"	4.71
6021	Double Orange Starfish	"Drank from a 1 pint (473ml) can purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA
Served in a teku. Cloudy, yellow-orange appearance. The nearly opaque body was topped by frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that fell to a lasting collar. A streaky latticework of lacing stuck all along the glass.. Fantastic hoppy and clean aroma. Big tropical fruit notes. Mango and guava came through strongest. Some honeydew melon was noticeable as well. Touch of dankness. Subtle citrus notes too. Nice juicy orange presence..  1,321 characters"	4.58
6022	Double Orange Starfish	Pours a blurry pale orange with a massive soft white head that seems content to stick around for the long haul. Sticky icky lacing as well.. Nose has elements of creamy orange and... wait is that worcestershire? I have... I've never smelled that in a beer before. Some dank element as well.. Small bitter NEIPA lead in that brings out some citrus and acidic pineapple before a mildly umami middle passage (I assume whatever is providing this is the same as gave me the worcestershire impression above, though it doesn't taste like that... just kind of umami), and a swing back to a light dull bitterness that's like earthy citrus..  1,110 characters	3.98
6023	Double Orange Starfish	L - 2.5 finger stubborn offwhite head atop a dirty orange body.. S - sweet pineapple, melon, caramel, anise.. T - starts with tons of sweet citrus. Candied orange, grapefruit, followed by pineapple, melon, dank. Low bitterness. Moderate sweetness. Low booziness..  346 characters	4.22
6024	Double Orange Starfish	Pours an opaque ripe-orange with a hint of light turning the edges an opaque white. Head is a finger in height (half pour from can) with good retention. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, resiny hops and biscuity, yeasty malts. Orange is jam like, but smooth and a little less residual sugar. Aroma has a little green bite to it at the finish along with a little alcohol when swirled. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine and raw grain, peanut and biscuity malts and yeast at the finish. Hop notes are solid, but not in the face, setting up a very controlled presence. Alcohol is absent from the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth - almost still - consistency that opens up to a lightly silty grain at the finish. In other words, texture is akin to a lightly rindy orange juice. Overall, hops are solid and mingle well with the malts, although the hops steal the show. It's getting a little higher in ABV, but the alcohol still remains absent in the flavor profile despite making a brief appearance in the aroma.. Served in a 15.5oz Spiegalau tulip from a 16oz can.	4.23
6025	Double Orange Starfish	Looks like a cloudy orange juice with a half inch head that tons of dots of lacing. Smells predominately of oranges with some malt and a bit of earthiness. Tastes of orange, mango, melon, a hint of vanilla, malt and some earthiness. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, a very nice hop bite with mild to moderate bitterness, creamy yet somewhat sticky mouth feel.	4.49
6026	Double Orange Starfish	Super opaque pale yellow body, identical to Tropicana oj with a massive slightly white head that leaves a full curtain of lacing. Nose is a big punch of pulpy not very sweet oj with a trailing edge of earthiness. Taste follows suit but is a bit more sweet than I expected, but in a good way because the balance of bitter orange, sweetness and a dry, gritty edge. Body is big, thick and dry. Very well done.	4.46
6027	Double Orange Starfish	I was underwhelmed with the regular Orange Starfish, but the double is outstanding. Tropical nose, big melon and citrus flavor, body is nice and full.. This can was fresh, and I’m guessing with a couple weeks to settle it’s even better.	4.58
6028	Double Orange Starfish	Pours a golden hazy hue. Lots of citrusy aroma. Wow, this really delivers. A lot of galaxy beers have been over hopped and provide a hop burn that is unbecoming, but this greatly balances the hops. There's a beautiful minerality. It is citrus fruit heaven. I really enjoyed this.	4.43
6029	Double Orange Starfish	i was so stoked to try this after hearing and reading an awful lot about it, and maybe it didnt travel well to colorado, but i was somewhat unimpressed by this when i had it at hops and pie this week, its a tasty beer, a cool expression of the hops, sturdy and fresh and goof, but it really didnt stand out to me as overly high quality or anything. its rusty orange tinted without a ton of head and a hazy density to it, mucky even. the aroma might be the best part, cut tangerine and orange zest, heavier citra than we usually get, subtle apricot and peach, layered and interesting for a couple of hops i know pretty well. the flavor is good too, starting better than it ends though, fruity and bright up front, plenty of orange character, orange candy, lemongrass, and a little grain sweetness, this is a little bigger than it needs to be right away for me, like i would love to try the original instead of the double, it seems just a little forced. right past the delicious apex of this, it turns green and chemical, over hopped, bitey, less refined than the best of these are by a long shot, and i have no idea if its an age thing, a flaw, or something from transit, but it really makes this pretty hard to drink and seems a shame after such an enjoyable experience up until here. past the saturation point and then a bit bitter as a result, broken down and muddled compared to earlier on, and by the end of a glass, i dont want any more at all, and i am left thinking this isnt any better than anything we have locally here in the same style, and when i think about the ones i have loved from the likes of outer range, trve, and cerebral, i realize this isnt really worth the attention it seems to have gotten. cool that it came through here, but ill need to try it closer to the source i think to get a better feel for it...	4.15
6030	Double Orange Starfish	"L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a dark orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a 3/4"", foamy, very long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.. S: A sweet and alluring aroma of hops, citrus fruit, malt, and some tropical fruit.. T: Tasted of a mild bit of malt (mostly in the finish), a big shot of citrus fruit (mostly orange), a good amount of hops (not overdone), and light tropical fruit notes (mango, perhaps?). This is a big, juicy, sweet flavor. Aslin has the NE IPA flavor down pat, and this is no exception. It has just enough hops to keep things interesting. Very tasty stuff..  721 characters"	4.29
6031	Double Orange Starfish	Awesomely good NEIPA. Looks perfect. Big juicy tropical and citrus notes, My only beef is it has a bit of a bite to it. Other than that it's an outstanding brew.	4.83
6032	Double Orange Starfish	I've had Double and Triple. Same great taste as Triple Starfish without being such a heavy hitter. This unfiltered beer has a great mouthfeel, perfect level of bitterness.	4.7
6033	Double Orange Starfish	loads of candied orange, peach rings, rich doughy honey malt notes, cream, mango, grapefruit, and a touch of herbaceousness that provides a mellow green quality. soft mouthfeel and overall very tasty!	4.52
6034	Double Orange Starfish	"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass.. Aromas of raw hops, fresh and zesty, green and herbal. Taste is sweet and bitter hop juice, fruity on the front and raw / fresh on the finish, very green on the finish with a significant dank aftertaste. Creamy mouthfeel but still, this is straight hop juice. It makes me
Wonder if this beer was done conditioning. Super raw. But insanely delicious, I love it."	4.35
6035	Double Orange Starfish	No canned date. Appearance - Pours quite hazy and dirty orange in color with an off-white, near two-finger width head. Fair retention results in a thin, broken layer or suds. Not much for lacing outside a few small patches and a handful of spots found here and there.. Smell - Strong citrusy aroma. Orange, tangerine and a hint of grapefruit with faint mango..  959 characters	4.4
6036	Double Orange Starfish	Drank this out of the can at a Nationals tailgate put on like Aslin. This just reminded me of heady topper for whatever reason - maybe a little sweeter up front, but a very similar nice bitterness. Would love to have this on the regular somehow!	4.68
6037	Double Orange Starfish	Serious orange bomb with soft mouth feel and a hoppy bitter finish. A lot better closer to room temperature than fridge temperature. A touch of ABV heat right at the finish of the hop bitterness that compromises the beer a bit, but that is being really picky.	4.48
6038	Double Orange Starfish	Appearance: Pours like an orange smoothie, with the bubble show eventually separating the liquid from the head; two fingers of foam stick above the cloudy orange liquid; excellent stickage that leaves a few shards. Smell: Orange sorbet and vanilla cream. Taste: Creamsicle in a glass, with the orange flavors combining with the cream; through the middle, a moderate bitterness builds but the finish is bright, juicy and slightly dank.  624 characters	4.49
6039	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Yeasty, fairly dry, and a reasonable barrel presence - wine notes are subtle, but grapes can definitely be distinguished. The nose is just a bit floral and quite pleasant.. Light, but thick, and quite easy to drink. Complex. Very good.	4.34
6040	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	This was the first beer I ever had from Hill Farmstead and boy was in memorable. What a great first trip it was and getting to enjoy this made it the best!	5
6041	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	"750 ml. bottle.
Bottled 2016 06 08.
Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 1/2 inch white clear over a super bright golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of funk first, followed by a bit of citrus, a tad of tropical fruit, and hay/straw, with some slight herbal/floral notes as well. Beautiful flavors of candied citrus, pink grapefruit, white grape, and finishing with grapefruit pith and just the slightest hops. Nice feel and overall, I know I waited too long to open this but, it's still fantastic! Cheers to Shaun and his crew for another world class effort!"	4.58
6042	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	"Bottled 2/18/2018 consumed 2/16/2019. Poured into a Hill Farmstead etched glass. L - pours a golden hay color with a 1.5 inch almost white head that dissapates into a nice lace. Not as crisp of color as I expect from some of HF ba saisons
S - lime rind hits the nose first followed by green apple. As it warms start to get a hay/barnyard aroma and the oak comes though nicely. Additionally the hop sent develops as it sits. With a deep breath can get hits of ethenol.
T - it has been some time since I have drank regular Dorothy, but remember it not being my favorite due to the bitterness. Initially get hop bitterness on the tip of the tounge. This is followed by a fantastic light barnyard funk. Finishes with citrus and citrus rind bitterness and the oak does start to come through the more I consume. Very slight acidity. I do get minerality.
F - absolutely plays on the tounge. Light, effervescent and does not coat the tounge at all.
O - for being the easiest of the ancestry series, I think I could try to get more bottles. It is very complex and unlike the non BA version I enjoy the bitterness immensely"	4.65
6043	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Sparkling clear yellow-gold with a tall bright white foam settling to a persistent blanket with a slight cling at the edges.. Smell is hay, straw, wild herbs and orchard fruits with a touch of toasted oak and a hint of lime rind.. Taste is grassy hay, lemon and apple, with more brett forward funk and bitterness than regular. Tart and crisp with a tingly semi-dry swallow, a touch of woodiness comes out on the exhale. Overall very well balanced and extremely drinkable..  754 characters	4.17
6044	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	B2 April 4, 2017. pours out a mostly clear brilliant golden straw color, creamy bright white head with suds atop and great retention. aromas of lemon, hay, fresh cut grass, floral, oak, mellow earthy funk, spice and bright citrus peel in there. on palate there is the above mentioned notes with even more depth and coherence. quite a pungent hit of fruity citrus and fuzzy peach flavor dancing in there, almost invoking characteristics of a NEIPA. but there is this beautiful funky dryness and oak character to balance it out. hay, fresh cut grass, lemon peel, musty grape skin, white grape, mellow acidity, oaky sweetness hinting at vanilla. the feel is so effervescent and crisp, wonderfully complimenting the flavor profile.	5
6045	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	2/28/2018 bottle shared with 5 others. Poured into a tulip glass. Poured a clear golden color with a bubbly, effervescent white head that lingered. Aromas of funk, oak, hay and subtle acidity fill my nose. Not much of a farmhouse aroma here as I feel like the barrel aging did away with that. Taste is divine. Tart, oaky, subtle acidity in the finish. Muted layers of farmhouse here but not very prevalent. Feel is light and bubbly. Almost champagne like. Damn good. Overall, this is an outstanding brew. HF already makes world class non BA saisons and when you toss them into a barrel, they elevate to a whole new level.	4.66
6046	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	I have had Dorothy before and think it’s wonderful. This bbl aged, dry hopped version is spectacular and I am so glad I shared it with a friend who appreciated it as much as I did. Smooth and tasty. To be sipped and savored. My taste buds are overwhelmed. Yay HF	4.71
6047	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	A- 750ml bottle into a small chalice with a mostly clear golden body and a thick frothy white cap. Good head retention and a fluffy ring remains at the edges. Thick sheets of lace form at each sip.. S- Hill Farmstead terroir with some added hops, such an amazing combonation. Lactic tartness from the bigs with notes of underripe stonefruit, passionfruit, apricot, Bretty barn funk, vinous oak and a very slight acetic hint. Bright and balanced between the hops and bugs.. T- The hops provide some more balance here as the Brett goes up and the lactic bacteria goes a bit down. Herbal, floral and fruity (stone/citrus) hops with lactic yogurt, fresh crushed wheat, vinous wet oak, vanilla oak degradation and underripe tart apricots. Horsey and a bit barney but still balanced wonderfully..  1,051 characters	4.71
6048	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge, froth head.. Smells very promising and complex - the nose is filled with dried herbs, lemon zest and a note of orange juice, as well as white bread dough and wet hay. There is a cookie sweetness coming from the hay, which gets almost entirely swallowed by the tart lemon presence, but manages to cut through. A whiff of old basement, together with some wooden mold establish a fantastic counterpart to the bright fruitiness.. Has a soft and light mouthfeel, which got a well nuanced sparkly, mineralic carbonation to it, which becomes most present during the finish, lending a well deserved refreshing note to the beer..  1,347 characters	4.91
6049	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	"L: Golden honeycomb hues with a thin white head
S: Lemons, hay, slight mineral component, and a balanced funk
T: Even keeled citrus profile - grapefruit, lime, and lemon pith - complemented by a soft white wine note, oak, and that classic HF-style finish
F: Effortlessly soft and crisp mouthfeel
O: Another incredible saison from Hill Farmstead. Nicely complex profile with citrus, wine, oak, and a slight funk. Awesome."	4.75
6050	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Gold pour, hazy, larger head. White wine, grape, oak, yeast, slightly catty, citrus aroma. Nelson and citra hops give way to yeast, oak, white wine, white grape. Slight catty taste. Lighter body, drying mouthfeel. Stellar	4.6
6051	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	This one pours a mostly clear golden sunshine yellow, with a small head, and a very small amount of lacing.. This smells like chalky, minerally funk, with lots of citrus- mostly lemon lime and white pepper.. This tastes pretty good, but it's surprisingly mellow. It's a slow sipper, complex, and doesn't bash you over the head with a farmhouse anvil. I get sour lime, white wine, minerally funk, sweaty Brett, and grapefruit. There's much less of a hop presence here than the normal Dorothy, which is not surprising..  656 characters	4.57
6052	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Had onsite at Anniversary 2017, and it was amazing. So different than regular Dorothy, wouldn't recognize the association. Barrel Dorothy was golden and slightly opaque, fluffy lasting head, fruity, mild barrel tones, and smooth. Unbelievable, must try!	4.88
6053	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	This is a glorious example of why Hill Farmstead is probably the best brewery in the world. Complex layer upon layer of flavors, smells and mouthfeel that was simply amazing. I aged this for a year in my cellar and just spectacular....even better than when I had it last year.	4.96
6054	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Awesome beer, very reminiscent of HF Sue--one of my all time favorites.... Nice Funky Saison with citrus and grapefruit bitterness on the finish, with a kick of dry hops, very concentrated and delicious!	4.58
6055	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad!. The beer is hazy yellow with a small white collar. Aromas of citrus, funk, lemon, grass, spice, floral hops. Zesty, juicy, floral. Delicious. Elegant balance. Tangy and quaffable. Damn, this is tasty.	4.66
6056	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Review is based on the dregs (last in line for a pour). Pours a cloudy orange hue akin to Sunny Delight. Nose expresses citrus, rind a just a hint of the wine barrel. Taste follows nose - a little little yeasty, but to be expected considering the pour was off the bottom of the bottle. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation. All and all, quite enjoyable; however, I'd like to revisit with a proper pour.	3.97
6057	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Big upgrade over original Dorothy in my opinion. The wine barrel add so much complexity, and this was perfectly carbonated as well. Not a lot of bells and whistles with adjuncts and or fruit being added, just a beautiful barrel-aged Saison.	4.73
6058	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	This has a wonderful bursting lemon mixed with pith that makes this complex, sophisticated and easy drinking. A major upgrade from regular Dorothy. Great offering, almost in the realm of Art, Ann and Le Sarrasin.	4.62
6059	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Pours golden. There's a musty grape aroma, some tropical hops as well. The aroma is incredible and it carries through into the flavor and feel. There's good wine barrel presence, but it's balanced by the Hill mixed culture and the dry hop. There is funkified tropical fruit and some grassiness on the finish. It's amazingly complex, super balanced, with no component overpowering the rest. BA Dorothy is a phenomenally delicate beer.	4.67
6060	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	750ml bottle, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow body, one finger thick head, short retention, bits of lacing. Typical HF saison appearance. Smells of grapefruit and citrus, more of a hop aroma, light bitterness and a bit of white wine sweetness and must. Light funk. Bits of oak. Flavour brings out more dry white wine grape, nice mustiness, light farmhouse funk, oak, and light acidity with a more grapefruit zesty bitterness. Very solid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, light and bitter citrus and saison yeast on the finish. Smells like a Hill Farmstead IPA, but with more of a white wine twist and complexity to it. It's not necessarily one of the better saisons from this brewery, but for what it is, it is very nice.	4.33
6061	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	750ml bottle poured into a Plan Bee Taster.. A~ yellowy orange with a tiny head and no lacing.. S~ tons of white wine funk! lots of lemon/lime up front followed by bretty hay and dank juicy hops... whoa!!.  857 characters	4.73
6062	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a Hill Farmstead goblet.
A - Color of lemon zest sprinkled across honey. Gentle carbonation wanders upward. The refined cap of almost crystalline structure melts away, leaving one ring to rule the glass.
S - White grape, oak, floral hops add tangerine and orange reduction. Warm wet straw hides in the back. a slightly sour tang rises as the offering warms.
T - Light grains mingle effortlessly with tropical fruits. The barrel aging is the host of the party, in taste the white wine and oak are debutantes. Burgundian quality in the notes, rich and assertive, yet polite to the guests, Pineapple, lemon tart, grape skin and light oak.
M - Medium in body, full coating of the palate well beyond the introduction. Slightly tart the palate rolls out that response, and is rewarded with just enough sweetness to smooth things out. The carbonation acts as Maitre D for the evening. The feel is delicate, nuanced and to be experienced.
O - This Dorothy is masterwork. The white wine barrel aging touch adds complexity and some genuine wonder. The body and feel are very much in the white burgundy mold, rich, a bit fat. All that and the dry hopping adds so much floral aromatic. An experience I will remember"	4.34
6063	Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged)	Thanks to Nate for snagging me a bottle during the visit to Hill Farmstead!. Rating # 2400!. 750ml bottle sealed with silver pressure cap..  1,444 characters	4.47
6064	Enjoy By IPA	(For the 10.31.19 version): this one is the best of the series since last year's July 4th version. Pours a gorgeous golden color with a decent head. Nice lacing. The aroma is pure heaven: some maltiness and resin up front, and tropical fruit noticeable. Taste is incredible: a veritable hop explosion, with peaches and those same tropical notes more pronounced. This is a dank brew with a pleasing aftertaste as well. Get it and enjoy, while it lasts.	4.62
6065	Enjoy By IPA	07.04.19, clearly not a fair review over two months out so I'll be understanding. Gold with fluffy three finger head. Whispy clouds of particulate. Sweet malt base with soft grassy, citrus, and floral hops. Some booze. The flavor is sweet, concentrated malt with grass, citrus and lots of booze. The hop character, I think, has faded, but it's still an enjoyable enough beer. While it starts out fairly sweet, the finish is dry with medium, pithy bitterness.	3.74
6066	Enjoy By IPA	Recently had the July 4th 2019 and not disappointed. Always feel comfortable buying the enjoy by..... Bitterness and hop flavor are spot on and golden orange color is very inviting.	3.78
6067	Enjoy By IPA	"An easy pour from a 12-oz. can is all it takes for a finger of pure white froth with some large bubbles, long retention and sliding ridges of lace. Golden straw color, slightly hazy.
The smell(as well as the taste) features citrus and piney hops with rich crackery malt and alcohol in the the background. The taste has added orange(and other citrus) peel plus unripe honeydew melon The taste at first is neutral on sweetness and moderately bitter,this builds to a dry finish with high bitterness that lingers a while. Medium-light body, + average carbonation. Boozy yet sort of smooth, full bitterness and some spice. I arrived a little late to the party(7/4/19) but its still a very drinkable DIPA. West coast style."	4.48
6068	Enjoy By IPA	Indulged in the 7/4/19 edition with the patriotic red, white, and blue can.. Look: Urine; lighter than amber. Creamy and persistent lace head.. Smell: My sense of smell isn’t that developed, but I get a lot of mango and papaya..  844 characters	4.48
6069	Enjoy By IPA	"Review is for the Enjoy By 07.04.19 unfiltered ipa. Packaged in Richmond Va., 05-28-19.
A- Nice, lightly hazy amber pour. White, frothy, almost creamy, head that dissipates to a soapy ring with moderate, soapy lacing. Inviting.
S- Delicious, inticing nose of peach, pine, and a light, underlying earthiness.
T- Quality is apparent from the first sip. Nice sweet/bitter balance. Citrus and stone fruit flavors up front, chased by pine and grapefruit peel. A tiny bit of peaty earthiness and some maltiness in the finish.
M- Moderate, resiny feel with no syrupy quality sometimes found.
O- Excellent. Great balance, rewarding flavor...a sneaky pete at 9.4."	4.4
6070	Enjoy By IPA	"This is the Enjoy By 7/4/19 IPA. Appearance: Pours a (somewhat clear actually) deep orange color with a mild, white head.
Aroma: Strong aromas of peach, pineapple, grapefruit, mango. Sort of earthy with slight pine. Alcohol and Sharpie is definitely on the nose here.
Flavor: Taste follows the nose with strong pineapple, grapefruit, and peach on the front. Somewhat weak fruit flavors though. Some resinous sweetness in the middle. Followed by a heavy bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The bitterness is dank and piney and lingers. Strong alcohol and sharpie.
Feel: Heavy and resiny body. Syrupy, sweet resin and bitterness on the end that both linger on the tongue. It's like pine syrup left on the tongue.. Overall: Not quite what I was expecting. Definitely a west-coast beer, as maybe I should have expecting. Attenuated fruit flavors, or maybe fruit is just what my palate expects these days with the haze craze. Strong bitterness that lingers. Body appropriate for the ABV. For a triple west-coast IPA, its a sipper/drinker. Good rating here, but not worthy of the BA Outstanding Score."	3.83
6071	Enjoy By IPA	Just got a can of the “unfiltered” enjoy by July 4th 2019. They ended up actually filtering it by mistake according to the brewery.. Hadn’t visited this beer in years, but I had fond memories of it! Purchased a 19.2oz can with some awesome patriotic labeling!. This was the worst thing I’ve ever had from this brewery. What a booze bomb, not just on the nose, but also the taste. The predominant flavor and aroma is harsh alcohol phenols that overtake anything pleasant about the beer. After three sips I had to put this thing out of its misery and pour down the drain. Honestly shocked they would release something this awful.	1.66
6072	Enjoy By IPA	Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Mostly clear golden-orange body with excellent two finger-thick head retention and lacing. Head is foamy, sudsy, gorgeous tan.. Aroma is very dank and fluorescent. Pine, honey, and graham cracker, along with other malts, are most of the smell. Other notes of guava, mango, grapefruit, and other citrus.. Piney hops, sweet honey, citrus juice, and grapefruit dominate the palette. Much like the aroma, although I taste papaya and pineapple as well. The hops are bitter and firm, yet the malty sweetness also competes for the front. Graham cracker provides and acts as a medium. Finely balanced. Heavenly and pillowy smoothness in the mouth..  690 characters	4.5
6073	Enjoy By IPA	Pours clear, like well shined brass, with a small-to-medium head that leaves plenty of lace. Nose is not big at all for what I thought this beer would be. Certainly some malt syrup and a little dank citrus, but certainly could have been bigger. Taste is more like what I expected with both the heavy hops and malt coming through. Earthy, bitter citrus, and heavy graham cracker. Very good beer, but I expected more.	4.19
6074	Enjoy By IPA	What better way to celebrate beer review #100 than with a big and bitter DIPA from Stone.. Date: Canned on 03/13/19, imbibed on 04/02/19, enjoy by 04/20/19.. Appearance: Enjoy by pours out a deep gold color producing two fingers of a pillowy white head. This is one ultra filtered beer, totally devoid of any of haze or floating particulate, it does look very inviting though..  1,737 characters	4.24
6075	Enjoy By IPA	"Finding Enjoy By 04.20 on tap mid-March, bought a bunch of cans and still enjoying on 04.10: still dank, beautiful citrusy, complex and awesome.. Agree with Brew Killer review: “exceptional in every way...” .
A truly world class, wonderful IIPA"	4.71
6076	Enjoy By IPA	"Look - looks like a normal double ipa but forms a nice head
Smell- almost unparalleled with heavy tropical with a hint of pine and grapefruit
Taste- perfect balance of bitter and tropical ipa. Orange, pineapple, papaya, and a touch of bitter at the end that forms a wonderful overall ipa taste
Feel- very drinkable for 9.4% . Very easy to drink fast which makes it dangerous
Overall- Stone has done it again. An excellent choice for any ipa fanatic"	5
6077	Enjoy By IPA	Bottled 11/19/15; drank 12/5/15 @ the Yarchives.. See-through urine appearance.. A rough pour yielded a big off-white head; a curtain of lace..  387 characters	3.4
6078	Enjoy By IPA	"Maybe a new favorite??
A double that feels like 6%. Alcohol is hidden, flavors abound. Crisp and has bite without being cloying or heavy. I’ve had on tap last year and canned this year. Not hazy. Good, crisp ipa. Grab some now!"	4.57
6079	Enjoy By IPA	It’s was a Christmas miracle for me today when I found this at my Piggly Wiggly. I’ve know about this beer for years but I could never find it in my area. What a Great Beer! Pours a crystal clear amber with great lacing. Smells of fresh pine and citrusy bliss. So smooth at first with a big hoppy bite you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is outstanding with very light carbonation. 9.4%ABV is sneaky because this beer is so smooth and refreshing. Merry Christmas to all and to all a Great DIPA.	4.79
6080	Enjoy By IPA	"Poured on tap.... Look:
Gold and clear. Sticky lacing.. Smell:
Sweet pine, nectar. Guava..  517 characters"	4.4
6081	Enjoy By IPA	This is my kind of IPA from a brewery that is passionate about hoppy beers!! Heavy pine, tropical fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, juicy, dank, the works!! One of my all-time favorites!	4.59
6082	Enjoy By IPA	Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap.	4.36
6083	Enjoy By IPA	[Original rating 2015-12-30] Draft at Horseshoe Pub, Hudson, MA. Aroma of citrus, a little pine. Taste is fresh citrusy hops, perfectly balanced with malt. Excellent IIPA.	4.52
6084	Enjoy By IPA	Not a NE style (thank God!). Just a beautiful Westcoaster bought at Sam’s in Durham, NC in a canned sixer for a fair price. Should have bought more because I only get there a couple times a year. Clear (no gassy yeast!), hoppy, a tad of sweet malt; this is one of their best. Don’t be scared of the monster on the can, just trust the masters at Stone and your Holloween will be perfect!	4.67
6085	Enjoy By IPA	Enjoy by 10.31.18 -. 22 oz. bottle:. Pours amber to copper with a creamy lasting white head. Lacing sticks..  508 characters	4.29
6086	Enjoy By IPA	"I really enjoyed ""Enjoy by 10.31.18"" from Stone, ABV 9.40%, IBU 90. I liked it better than the unfiltered Enjoy By, which had a garlic undertone (this one doesn't).. Look: Amber color, bubbly, with an inch thick white head. Aroma: grapefruit, mango, pine resin.  440 characters"	4.6
6087	Enjoy By IPA	This beer's color absolutely radiates gold with a big foamy head, an absolutely gorgeous pour. Aroma is upbeat and citrusy, but nothing truly of note. Taste is smooth, dank but sweet with the expected hops bite. The big ABV and malt keep it mostly sweet at the back end of a swallow. Mouthfeel, again, is incredibly smooth. Delicious, but maybe a little too rich for more than one or two a sitting.	4.19
6088	Enjoy By IPA	This is one of the top IPAs I've had (and I'm not an IPA guy). Really had solid hops and offered great color and mouthfeel. Super value compared to Treehouse, Heady Topper and other rarities.	4.56
6089	Scaled Up	Pours a very cloudy bright orange gold color with a sudsy 3 finger biscuit head that settles to a soapy, large bubble froth.. The aroma is strong with citrus, nectarine and peach notes, maybe a touch buttery.. The taste is similar with a wonderfully fresh and mellow semi-sweet peach flavor coming through up front. This blends into a orange-peach medley and is really quite pleasant. There is a touch of bitter dankness in the finish but otherwise it stays true to the initial taste..  808 characters	4.56
6090	Scaled Up	Appearance - Pours opaque orange with thick soapy white head that lasts forever. Light spotty lacing.. Aroma - Sweet candied orange, tangerine, pineapple, little pine. Big sweet citrus with bitter citrus peel undertones.. Taste - Just tons of sweet fruit mango, pineapple, tangerine, passionfruit. Great balance from the dry hopping makes the citrus powerful but overpowering. Pine, citrus peel big flavors..  658 characters	4.69
6091	Scaled Up	By far one of my favorite hazy IPA's from Trill. I feel like i say that every time i try a new one. This one is a beautiful yellow amberish hue with tons of haze. It has an amazing aroma coming from the dry hopping and hops combo which they killed. Citrusy, dank, notes of mango, grapefruit, subtle sweetness but also malty enough to balance great with the hops creating an almost perfect mouthfeel. Love you Trillium!	4.71
6092	Scaled Up	Bright, tropical gold appearance with a creamy, thick toothpaste head.. Aromas of fresh oranges, grapefruit, mango, and honey.. Flavors are juicy, with a mild resinous bitterness ghosting in the background. Flavors of bright mango, grapefruits, oranges, honey biscuit, and finish of pine..  420 characters	4.24
6093	Scaled Up	Tall can 11/29/17...about a month in the can. Typical NE IPA cloudy pour, lasting light khaki cap and leaves loose low sheeting and spotty lacing. Pineapple juice sniff.  276 characters	4.42
6094	Scaled Up	L - murky brownish orange with a floofy head that quickly and loudly dissipates. Pop Rocks.. S - sweet grape candy. Candied lemon pith and a wet earthiness, much like fresh rain. Guava.. T - grape must and grapefruit. Spicy and tangy, yet smoothed out by elegant flavors of white wine, orange vanilla, and peach. Some nice pineapple bite spackled with pepper. Ripe wild berries and a strong herbal bitterness to finish..  811 characters	4.44
6095	Scaled Up	Thanks to JLindros for hooking me up with a can. Like him I just haven't come across this beer somehow.. A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy light gold hue with a one finger white head that fades slowly to leave a creamy blanket and light lacing.. S - Aromas of some musty tropical fruits, papaya, guava, light pineapple. Little bit of citrus peel and juice, decent amount of resinous earthy pine. No discernible alcohol..  1,016 characters	4.07
6096	Scaled Up	SOmehow eluded me all these years, this one canned Setp 28th. Pours a lighter fizzy head that fades pretty quickly like it's high abv, no lacing, murky solid orange color.. Nose big tropical mixed with pine sap, dank resin, guava, mango, orange cream, papaya, pineapple, creamy malt, a touch of melon rind and mango skin, pithy citrus..  1,132 characters	4.19
6097	Scaled Up	"Thanks goes out to TheManiacalOne for this brew.. 16 oz. Can
Canned On: 22-Jun-17. Poured into a Squatters true pint glass a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy two-finger white head, which also leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, nice malts, with a really nice citrus complex (oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerines, peach), very nice diesel like. The taste is very nice, hoppy, very nice maltyness, really nice citrus complex (oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, pineapple, peach), very nice diesel like. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, with a very nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, another very tasty brew from Trillium. Addictive! Glad I got a chance to try this. Thanks Mark!"	4.93
6098	Scaled Up	Cloudy straw appearance with white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a mild citrus. Taste is also a mild citrus without any hoppyness that is a little thin.	4.28
6099	Scaled Up	I was lucky enough to have gotten an entire four pack from my friend John's trip up to the NE. It looks cloudy and yellow, and smells of floral hops. The flavor is more balanced than other trilliums I've had. It's fruity, bitter, almost sweet, and has a medium lasting bitterness on the end. Nit-picking, it's not my favorite trillium, but still far better than most other brews.	4.28
6100	Scaled Up	Canned 7 days ago.. Surprisingly subdued aromas and flavors compared to some of the other Trillium DIPA offerings. That being said, the beer as a whole works well and results in an amazingly smooth and light mouthfeel for 8% ABV. Best served in a snifter.. 87/100	4.32
6101	Scaled Up	Can dated 3/29/17. Poured into Behind the Veil Teku glass.. L: 2F head with pretty good retention. Leaves spotty lacing and a little bit of a cap and ring. Beer is a hazy pale golden.. S: Pineapple and orange, other tropical fruits. Light malts. Decent amount of earthiness on back end..  592 characters	4.28
6102	Scaled Up	L - hazy orange, head of large bubbles fades quickly. S - tropical and grassy, could believe it was all galaxy, hint of pancake batter. T - muscadine, odd tropical, slightly sweet, a moderate bitterness you feel more than you taste, clean dry finish.  411 characters	4.46
6103	Scaled Up	"A nice brew.
A very cloudy pale color. After pouring it in a glass i was expecting a wheat or flavor infused brew but I was pleasantly surprised buy the taste.
Medium body and perfect carbonation. I would say it is the best ale i have had from a can.
Worth the taste looking forward to m next from this brewer."	4.59
6104	Scaled Up	"Pounder Can > Snifter. A - Hazy orange gold with a finger of thin fizzy white head, no lacing.
S - Huge juicy citrus hops, lots of orange and grapefruit, pine, pineapple, papaya, then some nice floral notes as well, very bright but intense.
T - Big bold hop profile here, earthy and spicy hop resin, big citrus bite with some juicy tropical note in the background, very light malt base, big bitterness that isnt over the top.
M - A full and balanced feel of bitterness and body
O - So far Id say this is the best IPA Ive had from Trillium yet."	4.35
6105	Scaled Up	16oz can poured into a teku. A- pours a hazy pale yellow color with a thin foamy white head that reduces to a thin film floating on top. S- smells of peach skin, peach gummy rings, white wine, orange, cracked pepper.  412 characters	4.34
6106	Scaled Up	Look: Hazy pale gold. With a thin white head. Mild activity.. Smell: Pungent pineapple, mango, and fresh cut grass. Sticky on the nose. A bit boozy.. Taste: Tangerine, mango, bitter pine, grassy notes, and bitter citrus pith. Reminds me of a mango smoothie..  570 characters	4.34
6107	Scaled Up	Cloudy like all Trillium unfiltered beers. The color is dirty gold. Modest head which settles to the finest film of bubbles. There's a few spots for lace.. The smell is complex with a bit of bubblegum, berry fruitiness, and mild flowery hop. Attractive ask and inviting.. A smooth DIPA with a solid malt base. The dominates but doesn't mask the base. The beer is rich with an above average carbonation level. The finish is peppery and oddly refreshing (crisp) given the style. The aftertaste is not exclusively bitter; I get light berry sweetness as well.	4.07
6108	Scaled Up	Pale golden, thin head, and very small lacing. Aromas of intense grapefruit and dank resin. Notes of grapefruit pulp, citrus peel, stonefruit and pine. Medium, feels thinner than you'd expect, dry and crushable. It's good but it's lacking depth and it's an ugly beer.	4.07
6109	Scaled Up	"This is one of the better beers ive had. I had the privilege of enjoying this from a large can ""crowler"". Amazing flavor taste and believe it to be actually better than the phenomenal reviews this beer possesses."	4.78
6110	Scaled Up	I was told this is the closest hop profile to Headroom which I have yet to try. If this holds true, Headroom is bound to be incredible. Galaxy+Mosaic is always a winner but the additional hops here add a higher complexity to the flavor which I thoroughly enjoyed.	4.81
6111	Scaled Up	"Good double IPA, more bitterness than I expected from a Trillium DIPA. I was not disappointed with its taste, but did not have the smell/aroma I was looking for.
Defineltly, recommend for traditional DIPA fans."	3.87
6112	Scaled Up	"Look: .75 in head, Dark yellow to orange in color
Smell:super dank, mango, peach, vanilla, grapefruit... big display of Galaxy hops
Taste: very similar to nose, mango and peach shine fallowed by some Danky pine resin.
Feel: medium carbination and mouth feel, super crisp with a medium dry finish"	4.5
6113	Scaled Up	"Had this at the tap takeover at Rare Barrel as part of SFBW. Well ran.. Mostly yellow in color, the look isn't sexy, its muddled, clarity is nowhere to be found. Very thin 1/6"" white head. Aroma wasn't dropping the Nelson hop. Some citra/mosaic/galaxy, but the others didn't come across.. Wow, super light body, indicative of the wheat and pilsner barley. Alcohol isn't covered up as much as you'd hope, but its still bursting with hops and has a very soft exterior to it, the malt is super light and non traditional, and the hops aren't bittering hops, well the Columbus can be, but they aren't huge here it seems. Nice tropical fruit vibe throughout from the hops..  702 characters"	3.94
6114	Dragonsaddle	Special release beer from HH that stands out among their impeccable lineup of strong Double and Triple NEIPAs. Insanely well masked alcohol at double digit ABV and intense complex bouquet of tropical tasting notes. Worth the hype, but need to drink fresh.	4.75
6115	Dragonsaddle	Not to be cliche, but this monster hides the alcohol content extremely well. Super juicy, big pillowy body, and doesn’t carry the sharpness you get from a lot of triples. Finishes clean. Outstanding.	4.88
6116	Dragonsaddle	Poured into a Hoof Teku. Smell is strong with lots of citrus coming through. Graperfruit, papaya, some orange. Taste follows suit. Absolutely excellent triple IPA. Unbelievably smooth, does not feel like 11.5% at all.	4.59
6117	Dragonsaddle	This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style.	4.56
6118	Dragonsaddle	Poured into a snifter. Very hazy bright yellow color with a modest white head. Big tropical, grassy, and earthy aroma. Taste followed: pineapple, berries, mango, grass, and dank flavors. Smooth, full-bodied, and soft bitterness. One of my favorite TIPAs.	4.41
6119	Dragonsaddle	Amazing Triple IPA! Definitely one of the best I've ever drank! I was able to try this from a pretty old can, and even still it was hazy and super delicious. Very lucky to drink an all-time great!!	4.78
6120	Dragonsaddle	Another awesome IPA from Hoof.. Poured from the can into an HHB Teku.. This beer is so fruity and juicy its unbelievable..  221 characters	5
6121	Dragonsaddle	Drinking from a 16oz can into glass. I have a hunch that perhaps this can has been sitting around for a while as the aroma and taste is very muted and borderline stale (dare I say). Even still its a tasty big beer, with a surprisingly thin body for 11.5%. Not top shelf worthy, at least not the can I drank from.	4.2
6122	Dragonsaddle	To me, this is about as close to a perfect beer. The best part is how hidden the alcohol is. Sure you can't crush a bunch of these but just one could be just enough. With it's limits, that makes perfect sense to me.	4.98
6123	Dragonsaddle	Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice fluffy white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Lots of pineapple, mango, papaya and a hint of pine. Moderately bitter. Hides ABV extremely well. Huge tropical fruit flavor taste similar to aroma with some dank notes. Top notch imperial ipa.	4.94
6124	Dragonsaddle	Hazy as all get out, and mango fruit punch for days - I've had a lot from Hoof Hearted, but this is by far their masterpiece. Good luck believing it's a Triple IPA too, because it drinks like a single! One of my new favorites.	4.79
6125	Dragonsaddle	The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color.. The aroma is green and earthy, with a surrounding tropical aroma.. The flavor is a fruit orgasm of passionfruit, peach, guava, mango, tart orange and tangerine. Smoothie for days like Tree House. A bready malt comes in the middle as the beer ends with an earthy bitter herb finish and alcohol slowly drags it way down on the palate and esophagus..  504 characters	4.74
6126	Dragonsaddle	Pours a hazy golden color with pure white head. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Flavor follows the nose with big notes of papaya, mango and citrus. Has a bit of bitterness on the back end with a clean citrus peel aftertaste. Has a nice drinkable body and overall very delicious.	4.58
6127	Dragonsaddle	From can. Pours a milky orange. Very impressive head for a trip/abv. Sticky lacing stays in place well. Minimal booze in the nose. Honeydew and grapefruit rind? Great smell anyhow. Very sweet to mask abv. Noticeable carb but an overall smooth finish. Nice and sticky. Solid beer.	4.46
6128	Dragonsaddle	Poured from the can into a tulip. Huge beer, but pretty easy drinking considering the ABV. Tropical fruit, minimal bitterness, solid mouthfeel. Really solid triple IPA!	4.29
6129	Dragonsaddle	"L: standard TIPA color nothing special looking but very good looking
S: fruit fruit fruit butter hops barely detectable to me
T: no Dankiness to this to me just pure juice pineapple mango etc. exotic and delicious. Such a surprise. Alcohol so well hidden it's impressive the taste is beautiful.
F: thick but not too viscous good mouthfeel good chug this one back until blackout.
O: i had this on tap at Shelton brothers festival and it made the biggest impact on me. I did not expect this to be so delicious and drinkable I told them I would kill for this to be available in Louisville. Such a fantastic beer better than any IPA style I tried at the festival. Fantastic beer perfectly balanced. Whatever they were going for they hit on the head I do like some bready malt backbone in my DIPAS and trips but this is exception to the rule fantastic beer will seek out in the future.. I challenge anyone to drink a Devil Dancer and this side by side and not see how excellently executes this is for the style. Best TIPA there is out there, fit for a king. Wonderful beer."	4.99
6130	Dragonsaddle	Surprisingly one of the better triple ipas out there. Not overly bitter and weedy/dank.. Some nice tropical and citrus/juice notes. Very big ipa. Pretty juicy.. For the style, this is solid.	4.38
6131	Dragonsaddle	For me, I have experienced all of the hoof hearted beers I have wanted to sample. This.... this is the best by far. It is absolutely delicious with every sip you take. It has only gotten better with age. I can't really describe it too much. The aroma is pineapple, mango, peach, orange. The taste is straight juice with some hop bitterness. And the alcohol is covered so well that I can't even seem to distinguish where it begins and ends. It is one of the best examples of what this brewery can do and one of the best beers I have had all year. I truly love this beer and the 16.99 I paid for the four pack (x3 because I bought 3 total 4 packs) is well worth it. I think they have finally found there stride at hoof. I had roller blabe and didn't enjoy it till I waited 5 weeks post batch. South of Eleven was excellent. I really liked Konkey Dong. And this beer... this beer is truly why I drink the style. I just absolutely love it! I hope they can brew it more then once a year, but if that is the case... I will be back next year! Great job Hoof. You have finally made me want to consistently go to every release!	4.75
6132	Dragonsaddle	fresh can drank on 11/5/2016. very hazy golden look. the smell is super potent of tropical flavors. the taste is bursting mango and papaya on top of lots of tropical flavors. very drinkable, shocking this is 11%. overall a really nice tropical bold DIPA. Trying to think of what this compares to but I can't come up with much...maybe a poor man's King JJJJJ but doesn't matter. Great job HH!!!	4.5
6133	Dragonsaddle	"1 PINT can
Served in an oversized stemless wine glass. This beer pours like pineapple juice. It is topped with three inches of beige head that hangs around awhile leaving some decent lacing.. The smell is a tropical fruit lovers wet dream. I get pineapple, mango and even a little grapefruit..  649 characters"	4.4
6134	Dragonsaddle	"L: Pours a dark gold with a nice head that stays around a bit.
S: Dank with some citrus. And with some candy in there. Smells very sweet for how much alcohol is packed into here.
T: Dank and more dank. This reminds me of heady topper as if it became a triple. The citrus is toned down, but the candy comes through on the taste more than it did on the nose, and moreso than any IPA I've had. But without being sugary or sweek - it complements the dank & juice. It's a really enjoyable drink, and the flavors come out even more as it warms a bit.
F - Super smooth, again very much reminds me of heady topper.
O - Amazing beer, really glad to have tried it."	4.79
6135	Dragonsaddle	First beer I've given a 5 across the board..best IPA I've had to date, this is a deceptive beer it drinks like a TH double IPA but is so slam packed with fruity hops and more hazy..oh yeah and it's 11.5%, I've never tried a beer that hides it's booze content this well, a hazy delight.	5
6136	Dragonsaddle	L - not so sure about this label. Muscular humanoid topless dragon with a classic male stripper bow tie... and that's it. But then he's got a guitar in one hand and a wizard RPG character riding him. I have no idea. Pours a neon radioactive grassy orange green right out of the can. Damn! Murky, swampy... the color of dragon scales?. S - monstrously bright and fresh. Dank citrus, candied tangerines. Sticky melon and herbal character... like tea? Orange... smells like glowing. Smells juicy as shit, honestly. TIPAs tend to lean more toward strong ale territory.. T - bright mango juicebomb punch up front. Sweet without being cloying, candy without the sugar. Honeydew and orange city. Breaks into light grassiness complemented by guava. Earthy dankness and sticky crabgrass. Slightest twang of a pointed crackery malt. Not much but it's there! No way is this 128 IBU. Hardly any bitterness, but I do get a tingling novocaine numbing when all is said and done! That's the good stuff right there..  1,374 characters	4.74
6137	Dragonsaddle	This is an absolute dream to drink. 11.5% ABV that is completely hidden. Huge burst of tropical fruit with the perfect amount of pine. Seak out if you can. World class IIIPA	4.83
6138	Dragonsaddle	Tried it from the can and also poured into a snifter for review purposes. Really really cloudy beer, dirty yellow with almost a brownish tint. Very healthy lacing, but I can't tell how active the carbonation is because it is so cloudy. A gigantic juicy hop bomb on the nose. I could just keep smelling this thing if it didn't taste so damn good as well. Big juicy hop characteristics for the taste. It doesn't present much in the way of bitterness, maybe just a little at the end, but it's very citrusy with a slight sharp zesty tanginess that hits the center of the tongue. For a beer that is almost 12%, the alcohol is hidden rather well. This is a really outstanding beer.	4.69
6139	Flora - Blueberry	10.12.18 bottle. Delicate light beer with good blueberry flavors. Not overwhelming or fake. Heard the older batch was more jammy but alas I will never have it. Still a great variant. Have 4 left if anybody wants it...hit me up.	4.48
6140	Flora - Blueberry	Poured from a 375mL bottle onsite. Pink/red color with minimal head. Fruit and funk on the nose. Really delicious and drinkable beer. Delicate, not especially sour. Lovely.	4.78
6141	Flora - Blueberry	2019 vintage.. This one pours a deep but clear red color, with a small head, and a lot of lacing.. I had heard that there was some smoky/plasticky off-flavors in this batch - luckily, it's just delicious funky blueberry goodness on the nose, with tart blueberry skin and juice, lemon, toasty oak, grassy funk, and a sort of minerality..  861 characters	4.43
6142	Flora - Blueberry	"375ml bottle, October 12, 2018 bottle dated, poured into a Black Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.. The beer pours a bright garnet color, cloudy complexion with some beet red hues and a foamy off white head, minimal retention and no lacing. The aroma is nice, blueberry skin, funk, grape must, tart blueberry juice, lemon peel, light oak barrel and a bit of ""bandaid"" aroma that seems a bit plastic like and fairly bitter. The flavors are good, juicy and tangy blueberry, pleasantly tart, lemon zest, wine barrel, musty oak, tannins and a vinous acidity that brings out a nice mineral water forward finish. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy with a lively and bright texture that finishes with a tart and dry bite.. Verdict: A very nice fruited Flora variant from Hill Farmstead. The ""bandaid"" character mellows out as it warms up and is really only present in the aroma, but it is certainly a distraction. That being said, the expression of blueberry feels very natural and is quite nice."	4.03
6143	Flora - Blueberry	Bottled Oct 12, 2018.. A: Pours a clear garnet with a cap of bright white head with largish bubbles. Recedes quickly to a razor thin ring and then to nothing. Minimal retention and no lacing.. S: Sharp, earthy blueberry, moderate grainy wheat and pretty hefty horse blanket, dry spiced oak..  638 characters	4.3
6144	Flora - Blueberry	pours out a beautiful glowing ruby color with a very fizzy pink tinged-white head. inviting aromas of berry melange, tart blueberry, green apple, earthy hay, mellow barnyard funk - smells like a country beer! the flavors follow beautifully with under-ripe blueberries, grape skin, tart apple, hay, oak, mild earthy funk, almost a musty grape quality, sweet tarts, mellow vegetal quality, supremely crisp and effervescent. ridiculously refreshing and delicious!	4.71
6145	Flora - Blueberry	A - Pours a dark purple with a quick dissipating head. S - Strong, juicy, blueberry with a lot of wine-barrel.. T - Blueberry and grape juice is front and center, and overall, another beautiful tasting beer from HF.  377 characters	4.85
6146	Flora - Blueberry	Pours a beautiful violet color with a thin short-lived head. The nose is full of a cheesy sweaty funk, hints of sweet blueberry, vinouse wine, woody dryness, and earth. I get more blueberry on the mouth than the nose, reminiscent of juicy fruity blueberry jam mixed with wine. The finish is earthy and mildly funky. Medium body, clean and fairly juicy mouthfeel with soft and faint carbonation. Not the best blueberry beer available but I definitely enjoyed this.	3.97
6147	Flora - Blueberry	"First review in months. Been slacking, but I figured Blueberry Flora was a good time to start up again.. 
Pours a radiant dark blush purple, gorgeous fizzy head tinged with color highlights of the brew itself. Head settles quickly and leaves a beer much in common with a Shiraz in appearance.. 
Aroma is big wine barrel presence, raspberry much in the framboise nature, blueberry jam, oak, and soft vanilla. Big, juicy, bright nose on this. Most barrel I've had in my nostrils from Hill Farmstead..  1,669 characters"	4.74
6148	Flora - Blueberry	Purchased at Hill Farmstead in 6/2014. A- Body is a translucent raspberry hue that pours with a light maroon 2-3 finger very foamy, fizzy head. The head quickly and disappointingly fades almost completely to a thin collar. When held up to the light bubbles can be seen steadily rising to the top.. S- tart blueberry, sweet blueberry, acidic sourness. The blueberry is very authentic but I'm not getting any of the wine barrel or original characteristics described in flora or florence..  1,413 characters	4.23
6149	Flora - Blueberry	I've never had ann or mimosa, but this might be Mr. Hill's best beer. I don't want to like it as much as I do. I can also see this aging quite well. Brought comparisons to LP Kriek (which we had about 45 minutes prior). Hate on the man who brewed it all you want, this beer is the real deal.	4.75
6150	Flora - Blueberry	Appearance: pours a deep purple. almost black. a small, centimeter or two, pinkish head, with weak retention but some lacing. hazy and with some sediment.. Smell: tart blueberry maybe hinting towards dark fruits such as cherry. oak and wooden flavors. some funky earthy yeast to it. vinegar acidity.. Taste: opens up with some sweet blueberry pie filling. fruitiness extends to possible cherry to dark berries. tartness plays in along with some of the fruit. after initial fruit it is full of earth to funky yeast. ending has some strong oak notes and slight vinegar acidity.  784 characters	4.24
6151	Flora - Blueberry	Pour is a transparent blood purple with a pink head. Nose is a really nice blueberry cake aroma, nice faint grain and a decent yeast, faint vanilla and some fair oak, leathery brett towards the back. Taste is very nice, lots of bright blueberries, a bit of yeast, notes of oak, brett is just a hint strong in the back thinning out the great flavors a small amount with a bitter finish. Body is bigger, a bit prickly in the back, strong carb.	4
6152	Flora - Blueberry	Poured from the bottle into a HF tasting glass.. Appeared a dark purple color with a small, off-white head.. Smelled of fresh blueberries, some tartness, a bit of sparkling wine..  427 characters	4.75
6153	Flora - Blueberry	bottle shared on 8/26/14. One of the most beautiful beers I've poured. Overall, thought the beer could use some more carbonation and some more souring, but that's just me. The blueberry flavor was a homerun, but having this after BB Flanders left me wanting more acidity and funk to this beer.	4.5
6154	Flora - Blueberry	"Reviewing Blueberry Flora from the Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Greensboro, Vermont.. Score: 87. 
February 2014 vintage bottle from the June 2014 release, served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead taster glass and enjoyed on 08/06/14. Thank you Paul for the chance to tick this one!.  1,588 characters"	3.75
6155	Flora - Blueberry	375ml bottle. Thanks Dustin. Poured into a taster glass 8/9/2014.. A- Beautiful purple-blue body with a nice half finger pink head. Wow. This is so unique and beautiful looking.. S- Blueberries galore. This is full of rich, bright blueberries with that Vermont funk. Lots of white vinous smell here as well. Fantastic..  787 characters	4.35
6156	Flora - Blueberry	Reviewed from notes from 7/27/14. A- Pours a deep glowing purple with a small light pink head that quickly recedes to a collar that leaves some nice lacing. Little legs of small bubbles climb to the top. Some blueberry sediment is seen in suspension. Super pretty!. S- Bright, tart citrus and blueberry burst from the glass! There is huge influence from the wine barrel, and a good amount of pleasant funk. Lemony tartness, a touch of wheat, and nice oaky tannins. Pleasantly yeasty, with a characteristic Brett aroma as well as lacto..  1,121 characters	4.81
6157	Flora - Blueberry	500 mL bottle poured into a snifter.. Appearance - Nice purple body. Small pinkish white head. Medium collar.. Smell - Tart blueberry. Kinda yogurty. White wine. Some oak..  396 characters	4.28
6158	Flora - Blueberry	Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a snifter. Reviewed from notes from last night.. Appearance: Pours a deep raspberry/maroon color and leaves a finger of white head that fades to a rim around the edge of the glass.. Smell: Nice funky blueberry, grassy funk, nice mild sour aroma. Pleasant wine-y influence as well..  712 characters	4.54
6159	Flora - Blueberry	A lovely, dark blueberry colour with hints of ruby shining through.. Mostly oak and sour farm house must on the nose, but with definite notes of blueberry and a tiny bit of wheat.. Sour funk and oak lead through a wonderful balance of sweet blueberry and wheat.	4.85
6160	Flora - Blueberry	Poured from bottle into wine glass. The color was a fantastic dark pink with very little head. It had a tart amazing smell. The taste was tart and funky with a ton of berry. It was so smooth to drink with an awesome mouthfeel.. Overall this is an amazing beer. It met all the high expectations that I had for it. Absolutely delicious.	5
6161	Flora - Blueberry	Poured into a wine glass, a gorgeous dark pink. Fairly see through. Very little head that dissipated rapidly. Hugely drinkable. Really just want to chug this. Supremely subtle, nice wine flavor. Picking up the blueberries only slightly in their sweetness and tartness. Lots of carbonation. This is going down way too easy. Really good.	4.35
6162	Flora - Blueberry	Huuuge thanks to threelions for this.. Decent pink purple fizzy fluffy 1/2 finger head, purple pink raspberry color, hazy murky.. Nose awesome, tons of blueberry, blueberry flesh and skin, mild tartness, general fruity aroma. That great flora base, mild saison like funk, hint floral flowery note, hint saison spices, nice berry seed and stem, effervescent as Hell..  953 characters	4.36
6163	Flora - Blueberry	Epic thanks to Threelions for sharing.. A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a glorious blueberry juice hue, lightly hazy, thin light purple head that leaves light wisps and a fluffy halo.. S - Aromas of funky flora goodness. Nice barrel notes, the blueberry was strong and juicy but faded some one it breathed in to more of a skin/stem note..  683 characters	4.33
6164	Madagascar	"22oz bottle into a goblet. ""19"" is stamped on the label, so will assume this year's release.. Pours brownish black with a small dark tan head which fizzes out quite quickly. Carbonation bubbles can be seen popping on the surface, but no lacing.. Molasses, coffee, and dried fruit on the nose. Also, oddly, a little winey.  924 characters"	4.35
6165	Madagascar	Picked this up in Jenks, OK; thrilled to find it.... Pour an effervescent ebony with a thumb+ of caramel colored head. Visciuos, zero head retention & lacing. S: Dark fruit, woody notes, cola scent, subtle booze notes, caramel & vanilla late.  605 characters	4.41
6166	Madagascar	A barrel-aged milk stout is piqued my interest. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer produced a one-finger dark brown head. The beer's head was airy and creamy. The retention on the head was feeble. The color of the beer is SRM 36 a deep brown nearly black. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The head dissipated to a ring around the glass.. The aromas of the beer are molasses, caramel, toffee, dark roasted malts, medium roasted coffee, milk chocolate, cinnamon, earthy, anise, nutty, milk, bourbon, vanilla, oranges, oak, oats, and bready.. The flavors in the beer are molasses, caramel, toffee, dark roasted malts, milk chocolate, cinnamon, earthy, oranges, anise, nutty, bourbon, vanilla, oak, bready, oats, raisins, and dark stone fruit like cherries..  1,066 characters	4.47
6167	Madagascar	Bottled January 2017; drank 2/4/17 @ Golgi Apparatus.. Black/brown appearance.. Minimal dark tan head; no lace..  386 characters	4
6168	Madagascar	A- Pitch black as the Night King's soul pour with a tan-brown cap. The head has a creamy and foamy texture and peaks at about 2 fingers high with good retention. A ring at the edges leaves a few webs of lace.. S- The beer's name is 100% appropriate as vanilla beans really pop off in the aroma but don't overshadow the great stout beneath and it comes off as high quality and authentic. Luscious vanilla bean leads into dark chocolate, fudge, milk chocolate, licorice, burnt barley, coffee, marshmallow and suggestions of a moderate sweetness. The bourbon barrel melds with the vanilla here but some spicy whiskey hints here and there.. T- Gains some traction in terms of balance compared to the aroma as the underlying grain bill and the barrel gain strength in comparison to the huge vanilla beans. The beer is fairly sweet but nowhere near cloying and again balanced overall. Fresh vanilla bean, brownies, dark chocolate, toasted marshmallow, espresso and roast barley lead into caramel, spicy bourbon whiskey, booze, raisin, toast, toffee, fig and slight licorice hints. Complex and balanced despite having a ton of vanilla flavor radiating throughout..  1,653 characters	4.49
6169	Madagascar	"L -- 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a very dark brown body with total clarity. Scant half finger of mocha colored head produced with moderate pour. Minimal retention or lacing
S -- Vanilla, milk chocolate, boozy bourbon, oak, toffee, fruity coffee
T -- Largely follows the nose, although not really getting any coffee. The vanilla is definitely front and center here, and it works quite well. Bourbon barrel character becomes more apparent the more you drink and discern.
F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium- carb. A little limp around the edges and the carb is a hair on the prickly side, but nothing much to complain about here
O -- If you like vanilla, check this one out. Unlike most BBA stouts, this should be served at near-fridge temp as opposed to near-room temp.. 88/100"	4.36
6170	Madagascar	Tasted from a KBBS teku on 4-7-19. The booze in the aroma was stronger than the booze in the taste. The vanilla flavor was nicely prevalent. Medium carbonation. I think with a bit more bourbon heat this would be even better.	4.15
6171	Madagascar	"Let this guy warm up.
L - pours black with a one finger tan head that leaves minimal lacing around the circumference of the glass. Decent legs.
S - sweet vanilla, bourbon, milk, dark chocolate. Secondary aromas if berries, and molasses, and mild ethenol.
T - very well blended vanilla that does not overpower the slight bourbon, chocolate, or milk. In a world of sweet stouts, this stands out as a lactose stout that is nuanced and the adjunct does not take over the base beer.
F - I think the weakest part of this beer. It is over carbonated that leads to a thin BA stout.
O - this stands out as a well blended stout that show cases the vanilla"	4.19
6172	Madagascar	man oh man have i been wanting to try this one. finally grabbed a bomber of the most recent batch, poured into a tulip a dark, dark liquid with a brown little ring of a head that is now just a slim bit of bubbles on the edge. the first sniff of this i know there's something special. bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and toffee all blend together beautifully. just the right amount of sweetness, absolute heaven. flavor is more subdued, with vanilla powering in over a chocolate milk base, with a swig of bourbon making its way in from time to time. sweet but never overwhelming, making it smooth enough to drink as fast as you want. its full bodied but thin at the same time, drinks not too much different from the rest of their stouts. but the overall experience here is something to be cherished. happy i've enjoyed this one finally	4.5
6173	Madagascar	"Finally got to try this. Good amount of vanilla in this, with hints of chocolate. My old complaint with it is that the body is a bit weird. I think maybe because it's a milk stout instead of a RIS? Also, there's quite a bit more carbonation than I normally like.. Also, I think maybe the lactose in this is
throwing me off and giving me a weird kind of aftertaste. Although, it seems characteristic of 4 Hands stouts. I guess it doesn't help that all their stouts are milk stouts.. That being said, it's still really good and not overly sweet. Glad I got to pick it up"	4.1
6174	Madagascar	Absolutely beautiful right from the pour. A solid finger of dark brown foam sits atop an inviting, ebony black brew. Head retention is very good for the style.. Very sweet on the nose, with bourbon, vanilla, and cream really dominating from the outset. Deeper inspection yields brown sugar, oak, molasses, and chocolate. Very smooth aroma; not the slightest bit overpowering or intimidating - likely owing to the relatively low ABV for a BBA imperial stout (sub-10%).. Flavor follows, with tons of vanilla nearly overwhelming a creamy, smooth roasted malt base which itself yields tones of chocolate, coffee, and toffee. Bourbon right on the front edge manages to get its foot in the door before the vanilla rudely shoves it away - I love vanilla, so I don't see a problem there! The bourbon occasionally makes recurrences, with notes of sweet mash, and to a lesser extent, coconut and oak..  1,036 characters	4.59
6175	Madagascar	I should start by admitting that I am a vanilla junkie. There is a perfect amount of vanilla flavor In this and it perfectly balances the bourbon barrel flavor from dominating. Great job!	5
6176	Madagascar	"This beer was a let down. I went to the brewery in Missouri and was so excited for the ""copius"" amounts of Vanilla. The flavor did not come through. This beer should not be on the top 500 let alone 200"	3.75
6177	Madagascar	Pours a very dark chestnut brown with two-and-a-half fingers of mocha-colored head. Sheets of lacing.. Delicious aroma of cocoa, brownie batter, vanilla, leather, toffee and bourbon in the nose. Really great.. Lighter tasting than the nose suggests. Chocolate, vanilla and milk are the most prominent, with a little nuttiness, leather, tobacco and earthy hops behind to balance out any sweetness. Slight alcohol behind..  746 characters	4.07
6178	Madagascar	"Vintage 2018
Heavy booze aroma with vanilla accents. Bourbon is less prominent in the flavor with milk chocolate, toasted malt and vanilla taking charge. Thick texture and low carbonation."	4.15
6179	Madagascar	Opaque, near black body, with a frothy, cola-like beige head that dissipates with a hiss. Vanilla scents leap out, followed by lovely milk chocolate notes. Lactose and vanilla extract are prominent. Sweet, with a thinner than expected body. A delicious dessert kind of beer.	4.21
6180	Madagascar	"Drank from a 1 pint, 6 fl oz bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
2018. Review #1525. Dark brown/black appearance. The inky looking liquid was topped by a two-finger tall, super tight and frothy, tan colored crown that fell to a small collar. A few thin streaks of lacing stuck along the glass..  1,999 characters"	4.61
6181	Madagascar	"Pours black with an eggshell thin layer of khaki fizz. Aroma is strong vanilla, with bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. It smells like a vanilla Coca-Cola. Flavor profile is vanilla bean, milk chocolate, bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. Bourbon is certainly present, but is balanced well enough to keep from being boozy. Really, the bourbon just adds a little extra character and depth in an otherwise thin flavor profile. All total, it tastes like Vanilla Coca-Cola, with emphasis on the vanilla. Mouth feel is thin, fizzy and harsh - it drinks like a soda pop, albeit a little smoother. Fortunate note here is that it thickens up just a bit as the beer warms, but it is still barely scraping ""medium-thin"". Overall, it's thin and harsh, which isn't good for any beer especially a stout. Vanilla notes are strong and refrain from coming across as artificial, which is a plus, but beyond that isn't much.. Served in a 12oz snifter from a 22oz bottle."	4
6182	Madagascar	Wow. This is what I've always wanted in a vanilla stout. Aroma has tons of vanilla, some bourbon, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate. Smells like vanilla extract. Very nice. Taste follows with lots of vanilla, roasted malts, brown sugar, a little chocolate and just the right amount of barrel presence. Impressive how much they nailed the vanilla in this one.	4.43
6183	Madagascar	650ml bottle, undated but assumed to be fresh from the 2018 release, poured into a 12oz wine glass.. The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a finger of caramel head, moderate retention that yields some wet lace. The aroma is pleasant, lots of vanilla bean and marshmallow fluff, dark chocolate, fusel alcohol and underlying bourbon character with some nice charred wood, roasted grain and stone fruits. The flavors are very nice, lots of vanilla bean, marshmallow fluff, smooth bourbon, dark chocolate, roasted grain, charred wood, lingering alcohol heat and smooth stone fruits with a bit of caramel and brown sugar. The mouthfeel is very good, thick and viscous, coating with a heavy body and a soft but warm finish.. Verdict: A nice barrel aged adjunct stout from 4 Hands. The vanilla is nicely integrated, not overly cloying and the beer offers some nice depth to balance things out.	4.08
6184	Madagascar	Bottle poured; very little head and carbonation. Subtle hint of bourbon, no hint of vanilla. First sip - vanilla and chocolate pronounced on front followed by coffee and bourbon on back. As it warms, the vanilla notes begin to release. Silky smooth on palate.	4.49
6185	Madagascar	First review of Madagascar: 2017 vintage.. I was surprised to find it with a creamy, almost fruity, quality. It is almost like it had some sort of infection, but it worked out! The vanilla is perfectly subtle. I will revisit this review when I open a my 2018 bottle.	4.39
6186	Madagascar	Yeah, this works for me! Lots of vanilla on the nose and taste. Just the right amount of barrel and sweetness. Feel is medium and slick. Overall a delicious stout that i would glady drink anytime.	4.5
6187	Madagascar	Reviewing from notes. Thanks Brandon for sharing this.. Pours a black body with a small brown head. Aromas are heavy vanilla and chocolate, toffee and butterscotch. Taste matches the nose with big French vanilla, vanilla beans, milk chocolate. Medium body.	4.3
6188	Madagascar	2015 vintage bottle. Tart cherry on the nose as well as the taste. I had a velvet merkin that tasted the same a couple years ago. Same cola type head that dissipated very splotchily. Just bad for the style, but if you were expecting this in a beer it would be ok. This was an all time want for me so it was a HUGE letdown.	2.67
6189	Sure Bet	Smells great, tastes awful. Way, way, way too sweet. Also a bit effervescent which is unpleasant on the mouthfeel. Could only bring a few beers back from Chicago, unfortunately I gave this one suitcase space	2.53
6190	Sure Bet	A very nice take on the west coast style by Pipeworks! One finger head on a dark auburn filtered brew. Smells mostly of bubblegum (chicklets), papaya and a little mango. Tastes even more on the Bubble gum side but is very enjoyable and not hot, though my friend and I did get some indigestion soon afterwards.	4.4
6191	Sure Bet	One of Pipework's better malt-forward IPAs featuring the unicorn on the label art. This one still has a great hop character to it, accented by honey. Not too much evidence of the mango puree, just a general tropical fruitiness that I could believe was a product of the hops on their own.	4.3
6192	Sure Bet	"It pours a clear amber with a small white head. The honey is strong on the nose with notes of tropical fruits, caramel and resinous hops. Orange
The taste is quite fruity and resinous
The mouthfeel is nice with a good balance between the bitterness and the sweetness"	4.25
6193	Sure Bet	Hazy dark golden color with off-white head. Aroma is quite malty with overripe oranges and orange rind. Taste is also citrus forward with overripe oranges and tangerines and a slightly nutty malt backbone. Medium body and carbonation. Quite bitter aftertaste. Not bad but quite disappointing. Maybe I got an old bottle.	3.75
6194	Sure Bet	"L: amber gold with a light haze under a 1.5"" white blanket of foam. S: Earthy, resiny hops lead the aromas with mango and honey in the background supplemented by some citrus and citrus rind. T: The honey and mango flavors are subtle, providing support and balance for the malt, alcohol and hop flavors.  434 characters"	4.25
6195	Sure Bet	"A: The beer is quite hazy yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving a narrow collar around the edge of the glass and some lacing down the sides.
S: Moderate aromas of mangos are present in the nose along with notes of orange citrus.
T: The taste follows the smell, having flavors of mangos and orange citrus along hints of candi sugar (somewhat like what you would expect in a Belgian tripel) There is a light to moderate amount of bitterness. There are hints of alcohol in the finish.
M: It feels a bit more than medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: I really enjoyed the combination of mango and oranges in the smell and taste of this IPA. It was very drinkable considering its strength and I only got some hints of alcohol in the finish of the taste.. Serving type: bottle"	4.19
6196	Sure Bet	Between MN distribution & a good trading partner, I’m rapidly becoming a huge Pipeworks fan. This is the latest 22 oz. bomber to show up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Split with my wife.. The pour is light-skinned peach with virtually no head. The nose, is mango & sugar & citrus, oh my. Supremely sweet up front; let’s see how that carries over.. Sure Bet states it contains mango puree, but it might BE mango puree. Ever sat underneath a mango tree with mango syrup streaming into your mouth? It’s like that, only the tree, ground, & air are all mango too. Might be a mango too far. Additionally, there’s mouth-rending pure sugar (the honey, I presume), citrus, & low level of bitterness playing hide-and-seek with my tongue. Thick. My sweet tooth says “this is easy to drink”..  882 characters	3.57
6197	Sure Bet	Pours a slight hazed golden color with a white head. Smell had citrus and mango. Taste was fruity with alot of mango the honey muted the mango puree is a good way very tasty. Slight bitter mouth feel with a pine like feel had and orange and mango finish.	4.19
6198	Sure Bet	White head. Lace. Golden orange color. Clear, not hazy.. The mango purée shows a lot. Floral and herbal. Orange citrus. Some resin and stickiness. Abv is hidden pretty well.. Not bad for an imperial, but I still prefer the haze.	4.25
6199	Sure Bet	Pours an almost clear only slightly hazy amber/orange with a huge pillow of white head that sticks around and leaves fabulous lacing. Aroma is sweet ripe tropical fruits. Flavor is honey and fruit, no bitterness to speak of. Feel is thick for the style with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall a nice beer that (IMO) needs a little more bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness of this beer.	4.27
6200	Sure Bet	Features honey and mango puree, and Citra and Mosaic hops.... Poured an orange-amber color, hazed to translucency, with a finger of creamy white head on top... Was braced for something super-sweet, but this is a fairly restrained beer in that regard - tropical fruits, like mango - come through on the nose and sip, but have a very green character to them - making me think not or sweet, ripe, mango, but rather, the green skin of an unripe fruit... The honey is subdued, too, and there is more of a bitter tang to the beer than I expected, with a little soft honey sweetness rounding off the edges... Medium body has a tautness to it, which I appreciate, but I thought this would be a sweeter, fuller-bodied beer... Had to adjust my expectations as I drank it... I'll have to see if my impression changes with the second half of the bomber, but for my tastes this was really nice - reminds me a bit of a more bitter version of a Southern Tier DIPA I had the past coupla days, Help! On The Way!, which also featured mango...	4.29
6201	Sure Bet	It's funny to me that this is one of Pipeworks' highest rated beers, while their stouts haven't made top 250 - funny how the world spins.. Pipeworks distro in MN is still a bit in flux it appears as this bottle popped up in different places over a week or two - thankfully, I was able to grab one before it had too much age on it. This is one of those IPAs that I'm not sure I'd worry too much about age. It's not loaded with sediment and haze, so I think it might weather a bit better. It pours a much cleaner tangerine sort of color with a very nice, clean, sweet nose. The taste is similar, though it does seem to open up a bit as it warms. It has a bit of a ragged edge while too cold. Again, it's awfully sweet - that honey definitely comes through, while the mango provides plenty of tropical fruity sweetness. It's almost cloying in texture and mouthfeel - very rich, very thick.. I like Sure Bet - it's a pretty excellent IPA. As sweet as it is, I'm not sure I could stomach more than a glass at a time - so it's more of a novelty to me than anything. Great beer, but certainly not a go-to for me.	4.25
6202	Sure Bet	Pours an effervescent honey color with a thumb+of eggshell colored head. Great lacing & head retention. S: Citrus, pine, breadyness. Mango shines through as it warms. T: Huge breadyness & mango presence along with dryness from the honey up front, faint orange notes as well. Dryness, mango, a little pine mingle as this warms, plus a little more orange. Finishes citrussy, a little dry with a little apricot & plenty of mango.  555 characters	4.32
6203	Sure Bet	Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Teku.. Pours a pretty clear orange body with a frothy white head that reduces to leave chunky retention and lacing.. Aromas are malty and sweet, lots of honey with some peppery hops in there. Taste matches the nose with sweet honey and a touch of fruityness sitting in on a substantial malt backbone, lightly bitter resinous dank hops in there too. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation, insanely drinkable for 9.5%.	4.12
6204	Sure Bet	A-a clear light orange with three fingers worth of white head. S-caramel malt, citrus, and pine. T-grapefruit and other citrus fruits, light tropical fruits, honey, and a tart finish that seems out of place.  318 characters	4.08
6205	Sure Bet	"Bomber bottled recently in past couple weeks but no date available.. Semi-clear amber/copper body with a thin white frothy head. Foam sticks to the glass.
Nose of mango with readily apparent alcohol heat, floral, green, some honey quickly followed by grapefruit, tangerine, and more booze.
Taste is grapefruit, tangerine rind, mango, and a honeyed booze character.
The mouthfeel is fairly sticky and oily. I find that the mango puree imparts somewhat of a syrupy texture into the beer that really makes it less enjoyable.
This beer has a lasting sweetness that somehow reinforces the alcohol burn in an unpleasant way. I could see this beer being tweaked and hitting the right balance but this bottle didn't really do it for me."	3.96
6206	Sure Bet	Released 6/8/18; drank 6/15/18 @ the Yarchives.. See-through orange appearance.. A rough pour yielded a nice white head; strong tree-rung lace..  388 characters	3.98
6207	Sure Bet	2018 bomber poured into a PW Willi. Pretty dark in color and super clear/filtered. White head develops and sticks for a moment. Sticky lacing as I move the glass around. Not much aroma going on to be honest. Flavor is disappointing. No honey or mango at all. Pretty standard imperial Ipa. Feel is sticky and medium bodied. Overall, this is disappointing. Literally got none of the flavors advertised.	3.49
6208	Sure Bet	650ml bottle, purchased fresh, poured into a Pipeworks Ninja teku glass. Enjoyed on 8.3.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.. The beer pours a copper color, displays chill haze with some orange hues and a foamy white head that has great retention and lace. The aroma is very good, tons of tropical fruits, loads of mango puree, citrus, pineapple, nicely floral with a strong malt backbone, sweet and bready with lightly warm alcohol. The flavors are nice, juicy mango, lots of fruitiness with a lightly piney and resinous counterbalance, moderate bitterness with strong sweet pale grains and warm alcohol. The mouthfeel is good, coating, medium body that is creamy and smooth with a warm and dry finish.. Verdict: A very good IPA from Pipeworks. Tons of mango, tons of tropical fruits, really bright and refreshing but more malty and sweet than I'd prefer and the warm alcohol is a consistent issue for me with Pipeworks IPAs. Very good beer but not quite rising to the upper echelons of the style.	4
6209	Sure Bet	Love their beers, they play more on rhe malt side of things but definitely in balance. Wish i had more than one to sample. A bit dry in the back end and floral/fruity on the nose.	4.34
6210	Sure Bet	"A - Pours a bright opaque orange with a 1/4"" white head.
S - Big mango aroma.
T - Flavor is as advertised. Citra & mosaic hop IPA with mango and honey in the perfect combination. No bitterness.
M - Low carbonation, somewhat soft mouth feel.
O - Really good beer."	4.46
6211	Sure Bet	Appearance - The beer poured a murky orange-yellow color with white bubbles crown and glass.. Smell - The beer had a huge mango nose with some dankness also detected.. Taste - At the front, this is a big syrupy and slightly spicy double IPA. Sweet fresh mango blends nicely with the dank. The honey helps to lay a sweet backbone. At slightly sweet dankness lingered..  505 characters	4.54
6212	Sure Bet	Hazy faded gold with a fluffy white head. Smell features lush mango, honey, candied orange, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, and lime. Taste is much the same, but simpler, more focused on sweet mango and honey contrasting with the pine, hops, and slight flowers. Feel is resinous, hoppy and slightly thick. Great flavoring, but definitely on the heavier and heavy handed side of the spectrum.	4.38
6213	Sure Bet	Straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a fruit accent. Taste is also hoppy with a fruit accent. This was not as flavorful as expected	4.31
