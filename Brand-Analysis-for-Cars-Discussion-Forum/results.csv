1	June 21, 2004 10:21PM	bodble2	"for car guys (& gals), it's the thrill of the hunt. The purchase itself is merely the culmination of the process, and the impetus to start the next hunt! We're serial-car shoppers. And like serial-anything, we're biologically-wired to get turned on by the lure of the hunt.

The fun is all in the hypothesization, visualization, research, viewing, auto shows, discussions, test-drives, and more research, etc, etc."
2	June 22, 2004 3:37AM	stickguy	"I just love cars, and hav esince I was a little kid. I had a subscription to Car and Driver and Motor trend when I was 10, if that gives a clue.

I have had an assortment of cars over the years, but continue looking no matter how recently I bought. I don't usually buy right away, but keep looking anyway.

It's part hobby, part addiction, but I will look at anything, anywhere. I usually get fixated on one thing for a while, until the next set of wheels catches my eye.

If NJ didn't have a 6% sales tax, and rediculous DMV and insurance fees (and I had more garage space), I would probably have a revolving door of odd wheels going most of the time. My wife woldn't appreciate it, but I consider that her failing, not mine!"

8	June 23, 2004 2:32AM	anonymousposts	"CCB syndrome or does this make sense?

I have a 04 EX-L Accord right now. I can buy a 97 Infiniti I30 for $4,000. Does it make sense to trade/sell the Accord for this car and save approximately $15,000 or should I keep the Accord and try to hang on to it for 10 years? The Accord is undoubtedly safer and gets better gas mileage. The insurance will probably be a wash .. the Accord is only $250 every 6 months. But is the Accord $15,000 safer and more economical than a nice, clean I30?

So is this common sense or CCB syndrome?

I should note that we will still have a 2004 Ody to use for family duty and a 03 Civic Si for commuter duty. The Accord is used for trips when one of us have the baby or short trips around town. The I30 would take the Accord's spot and be used for the same purposes."
9	June 23, 2004 2:47AM	stickguy	"probably CCB, although wether you save money depends on how reliable the i30 is.

At this point, you will probably be better of fin the long run by keeping the Accord for 10 years, instead of buying another car every 1-2 years. But, that would be much less fun."

13	June 23, 2004 3:02AM	anonymousposts	"Well ... there is an easy explanation ...

Ummm... you see ... what had happened was ..... geez .... okay ... ummm

Seriously, the first SI was a black 2000 that I got for a steal .. only $10,000 when at the time they were being sold for $14,000-$15,000. Then my husband had a similar opportunity on a blue 2000. After he bought his it seemed to me that my black 2000 wasn't as solid. Well about that time the 02 Si's were being given away. I got $2000 more in trade than I paid for the black Si and got the 02 Si for below invoice. Couldn't pass that deal up.

Well unfortunately 3 weeks later some idiot in a Grand Am turned in front of me and ended up totalling my 02 Si. So I bought another one to replace that one. Well that Si was cursed. Within 6 months it had a new windshield, it had rolled down my driveway and into the mailbox, it rolled down a hill in a new housing development and ended up in a construction area (no serious damage in either incident) and a shopping cart got up close and personal with my rear quarter panel. SOOO ... we traded that for a 95 GS300 which my husband started driving and I took his 03 Accord coupe (by this time he had traded his blue 2000 SI for the Accord). Well .. after gas prices went up and we moved 15 miles further out my husband started missing the Si. So he traded our 97 Dakota (which we had acquired after the GS300 and the move) for a 03 Si and soon thereafter we sold the GS300 to a private party.

And that's how you end up with 5 recent model Si's in 2 1/2 years."

17	June 23, 2004 3:49PM	stickguy	"good thing I have a strong cheap gene too, or my list might be this long.

I was much worse buying in the old days when I drove bombers. Used to actaully turn a profit on most of them too. Now, with better taste (and other obligations), I look more than I buy.

At least I'm getting off the wagon more (bought my '01 Miata last November, and scheduled to pick up a new Scion tC next week).

The Miata is now on the market. Wife wants a new family car before OEY, so we start shopping for that soon.

Based on all this, will be toy shopping again in the spring. This time though, it will be a cheap toy (way too much invested in the current Miata for the use it gets)."

I buy a car about once a year and get so much flack from my family and friends that I don't try to purchase more frequently. I alternate between buying new and buying WAY used, like $1000-2000 cars. The old ones are fun as project cars and to see what they are capable of, while new car fever is just what it is. I have had three new ones in the last four years, so I should probably slow that down a bit! LOL

anonymous: I am impressed by the number of integras on your list! :-)"

I thougt that the list would be shorter. Bought the Corsica to keep a friend out of bankruptcy - a mistake that i will never make again. People who can't afford a car, can't afford to take care of the one they have. Sold it six months later.

Would not have bought the Ford but the leasing company made me an offer I could not refuse. And we thought that my wife would be layed off and lose her company car.

The running total of the nine cars that I have ought is $45,400, which isn't too bad."

24	June 23, 2004 8:38PM	wale_bate1	Funny. I don't buy all that often, but I'm in constant shopping mode!
25	June 23, 2004 8:46PM	seminole_kev	"again, you and me are way too alike. I'm always mulling over, thinking about, and online shopping/configuring cars.....then I come to my senses and don't buy any thing. Then Company XYZ unvails the new Wizbang 5-door RWD hatch with 400 lb/ft of torque and a nice 5 speed manual and I go through the whole thing again.

Also (back to the ""dissimilar car shopping"" thread), I'm always mulling over in my mind ""You know, a small nimble 2-seat roadster would be fun....but what if I want to pick up a TV or some odd sized object? OK what about a 5-door hatch that's fun and practical....well I've got that now, time for a change. How about something with 500HP....well what about poor gas mileage and insurance as well as not being too practical?"" On and on and round and round it goes!

Yes I'm not well and have cars on the brain wayyyy to much."
26	June 23, 2004 9:19PM	wale_bate1	"Actually, I recently gave up on buying. I like newness and get bored/distracted too easily to hang on to anything long.

My situation is conducive to leasing from an expense/deduction angle. That fits with my personality quite well, I've determined! The longest I ever kept a car, other than my first, is six years. The current one is a 39-mo lease, up in 20 mos. I've been shopping for the replacement now for, oh, about four months! And I love this car!

Yup, got 'em on the brain just like you!"
27	June 23, 2004 11:30PM	bodble2	to be fair though, you work in car sales, so you are somewhat predisposed to CCB syndrome. Afterall, you're in the biz! Is like if I were a pimp, I would likely more frequently engage in....well, never mind that!
28	June 24, 2004 2:43AM	stickguy	"You described me to a ""T"". I seem to be on a buying binge lately, but once my wife and I both have new wheels, I may be done for years.

Of course, it won't prevent me from stopping at a different dealer on the way home from picking up the new one, or reading all the magazines (and of course hanging out here).

Never know when something might happen and yo need a replacement quick!"
29	June 24, 2004 1:51PM	andre1969	"here's my list, over the years...

1980 Malibu: Mom gave it to me (1987-1990)
1969 Dart GT: saw it at a Nissan/Saab/Oldsmobile dealer of all places, fell in love with it, and bought it. (1989-1992)
1957 DeSoto Firedome: I'd been lusting after a mid-late 50's DeSoto ever since I first saw a picture of one, so when I found this one I just had to have it.(1990-today)
1968 Dart 270: bought to replace my '69 GT, which got totaled when I got run off the road and hit a traffic light pole. (1992-today)
1969 Pontiac Bonneville: bought it from my cousin for $400. I should have known better! (1992-1996)
1982 Cutlass Supreme coupe: bought it for $800 when the Dart started nickeling and diming me to death. Only had 61K miles on it, and was inspected. I figured it would be more reliable and get better gas mileage. It wasn't. And mileage wasn't that much better, not enough to offset the fun factor of the much more powerful Dart! (1993-1994)
1967 Pontiac Catalina Convertible: saw it and had to have it. (1994-today)
1988 Chrysler LeBaron turbo coupe: bought it from my uncle when I got married. Along with the '82 Cutlass, I'd say this was the biggest POS we had. I got divorced, but got the last laugh because...I LET HER HAVE IT!!! (1995-1996)
1979 Chrysler Newport: For some reason I've always liked these things. I found this one in the junkyard...just came in, started right up, and hadn't been picked on yet. Bought it for $250. Odometer said 30K miles, which I figured was about 130K miles, given the condition of the interior. Well, when I got the paperwork, the previous owner had bought it about 10 years before, with 105,000 miles. So in all probability, it was more like 230,000! A nice little side benefit of this car, in a twisted sort of way, was that my family HAD been nagging at me to buy a newer car than that 300,000+ mile Dart I was driving! I don't think this was what they had in mind though. (1996-1998)
1986 Monte Carlo: Mom gave it to me, with 179,000 miles on it. 3 months and 13,000 miles later, I got T-boned while delivering pizzas. Wasn't TOO major of a hit, but it bent the A-pillar and cracked the windshield, and buckled the floor pan just a bit. Did most of my driving with this car, because it got much better mileage and acceleated better than the Newport (1998-1998)
1989 Plymouth Gran Fury: this one was a former police interceptor from Richmond VA. It was also a sherriff's car, so in addition to the high-performance equipment, it was better equipped than most police cars, with carpeting, cloth seats, a nice stereo, power locks/windows/mirrors. I bought it because I wanted something newer than that Newport. Unfortunately though, it wasn't any more reliable. (1998-today)
1985 Buick LeSabre Limited Collector's Edition: Don't laugh, that was its name! Grandmom gave it to me when she couldn't pass the eye test for her license anymore. (1999-2002)
1967 Chrysler Newport: a 108K mile beater a buddy gave to me when his grandmother died, and they just wanted it gone so that they could clean up her house and sell it. I only had it about 6 or 7 months. Decided to get rid of it when I bought my Intrepid, and that decision was reinforced when the brakes went out. (1999-1999)
2000 Intrepid: bought it brand new. Originally I was just taking my uncle to the dealer to pick up his truck from servicing/repair, but then he wanted to go look at the new cars. I had intended that day to ride up to another dealership that had a '95 Riviera for sale that I was interested in. But we never made it... (1999-today)
1979 Chrysler New Yorker 5th Avenue: I'd been going through R-body withdrawal ever since I got rid of my '79 Newport, so when I saw this thing on Ebay, I was able to satisfy that strange fetish... (2001-today)
1985 Chevy Silverado: Granddad bought it new. A few years after he died, Grandmom gave it to my mother. She bought a new F-word 150 and then gave me the truck (2002-today).

I think that's all of them. I used to live in a condo, but now in the boonies, so lemme go cut the grass and see if I find anymore! ;-)

Oh yeah, I'm also babysitting a 1952 Mercedes Benz 4-door for a friend of mine. I want to say it's a 220? I forget now. Nothing too special though...just a rusty parts car."
30	June 24, 2004 2:39PM	nippononly	"the highest number of cars anyone has owned at one time?

For me, it is five, and I am single. One was new, the other four were well used. I almost had a different car to drive for every day of the week! That was when my CCB syndrome had reached its zenith. Most of the time since the mid-80s I have not had more than three at once."
31	June 24, 2004 2:57PM	driftracer	Getting ready to be 4 again real soon, and maybe 5, depending on how fast the PT sells while I have the F-350 on order.
32	June 24, 2004 3:04PM	nippononly	"at the time I had 5, I had this faint justification in the back of my head that I had the extra cars in case the new one broke down. Weak justification at best, you might think. The new one at the time was the Saturn SL2, and yup, sure enuf, it broke down twice! :-P

I also had a turbo '87 Supra, an '86 Celica GT-S, a rear-ended '82 Supra that I picked up for $500 and ran great, and an '84 Subaru GL hardtop. They were all gone within 18 months, including the Saturn! Should have kept that Celica longer. It ran perfectly and only had like 60K on the clock even though it was 9 years old."
33	June 24, 2004 3:13PM	andre1969	"with 7. 6 of them are tagged and insured. 3 of them are on an antique policy that's really cheap, like $170 a year for 3 cars (Dart, DeSoto, Catalina). The Intrepid, pickup, and 5th Ave are on a regular policy that's something like $1440 a year for all three (only the Trep has full coverage). So that's one reason that I'm a bit lax about not getting rid of cars...it's not like it's costing me an arm and a leg to insure them. I think my roommate pays more insurance on his '98 Tracker than I do on BOTH of my policies!

I need to get rid of my Gran Fury. Just been too lazy to mess with it, I guess! And I really need to cut my Dart loose, as it's got 338,000 miles on it now, and not currently running. I think it just needs a fuel pump to run again, but it has other issues as well (rust, some body damage, water leaks here and there, a shorted out heater fan, etc). But on the plus side, the Dart costs a whopping $24 a year to insure...which is one reason I've probably been lazy in motivating myself to get rid of it!"
34	June 24, 2004 3:31PM	stormdavy	"but haven't the resources to buy. Getting tired of the rusty looks of my Celeb, and recently made an offer for an (affordable, w/ 116K mi) '89 Vette, and that was the closest I've been yet to being a Vette owner, but unless a miracle happens I won't get financing.
Now, the '01 Impala is falling into my lap. Most weekends I'm checking out car lots... and tall grass can yield some beauts, too: one nearby farm has a blue Cougar convertible that could be in an Andrew Wyeth painting."

38	June 25, 2004 12:07AM	andre1969	"I've never owned an Altima, but I was really impressed with the current generation when it first came out. I test drove an '02. It was just a 4-cyl, but I think it was an S-model? Pretty gutsy for a 4-cyl I thought. I probably would have bought it, if I wasn't so upside-down on my Intrepid at the time!

My Mom & stepdad have a '99 Altima. I think it's an ugly excuse for a car, and wasn't too thrilled with it when it was newer. The tranny failed at 35,000 miles. But Nissan replaced it under warranty with no attitude. I think they have about 110,000 or so miles on it now. It did leave them stranded one other time about a year or so ago, when the battery died. I guess newer cars aren't like those old Mopars I'm used to where you could actually yank the battery out while it's running, and not have a problem. Until you turn the car off, that is! Still, I have more respect for that Altima now that it's got some miles on it, and still kicking."
39	June 25, 2004 1:37PM	kyfdx	That is my complaint with Nissans.. They usually run forever, but you aren't all that happy about it... I agree... that first Altima was a poor excuse for an Accord competitor.

41	June 27, 2004 7:23AM	nippononly	"I had such a complete and thorough listing of all the cars I ever owned. I used to do some casual selling, and would sometimes have cars that only stayed in my hands a couple of weeks, while occasionally I would keep them six months or more until I got bored, and THEN sell them.

Despite the large number that have come and gone, one that really stands out in a good way was my Subie Outback Sport, which is one of the few I bought new.

I saw a green one for sale just the other day, a '98 where mine was a '97, low miles, and I had half a mind to pick it up...what goes around comes around, maybe?"

43	June 28, 2004 4:58PM	andre1969	"that right off the top of my head, I'll forget about a car here and there that I've owned. Especially if it was during a time that I ended up acquiring/disposing of a lot of cars in a short period of time.

For awhile, I was averaging something like one car a year. If I missed a year, it seemed like I'd end up getting two the next!

I almost made it through 1996 without getting a single car, but took delivery of my '79 Newport on New Year's Eve! Didn't acquire one in '97, but then I got two in '98 and THREE in '99! Nothing new in '00, then I got my NYer in '01, and Mom gave me my pickup in '02. Didn't get anything in '03, and so far, nothing in '04. This might actually be one of the longest periods of time I've gone without picking up another car!"

1992 Hyundai Scoupe
1996 Ford Escort LX
2000 Ford Focus ZTS (current)
1985 Cadillac Fleetwood (FWD) w/ 4.1L V8

Not a lot of expiring cars in that list. In fact the first three cars I purchased for a combined total of $1800 (each were $600)!"
45	June 29, 2004 10:17PM	michaellno	"Just discovered this topic.

While I don't think I suffer from CCB, I too have always been interested in cars.

My list, which spans high school, college, two marriages and a relocation from California to Colorado:

1979 Pontiac Sunbird
1977 Buick Omega
1985 Honda Accord LX 3-door
1986 Isuzu P'up
1988 Isuzu Trooper
1991 Mazda Protege LX
1991 Nissan Sentra SE
1992 Honda Accord LX
1993 Honda Accord DX
1997 Ford Escort LX
1999 Ford Expedition XLT
1999 VW New Beetle GL
2002 Ford Explorer XLT
2003 Saturn L300
2003 Ford Focus ZX5

In summary:
HS/College - 2 cars (Pontiac, Buick)
Post College - 1 car (Honda)
Marriage #1 - 5 cars (P'up, Trooper, Sentra, Protege, Accord LX)
Post Marriage #1 - 1 car (Accord DX)
Marriage #2 - 6 cars (Escort, Expedition, VW, Explorer, Saturn, Focus)

Currently have the VW (step son is driving it), the Saturn (bought for me but wife is currently driving it) and the Focus (my daily driver, but may go to daughter when she turns 16).

So, there may be another purchase (or two?) this year -- I really like the Focus, the wife might consider trading in the L300 for a VUE when the weather gets crappy again and the daughter may end up with something else - the Focus is a stick and she is having trouble mastering a clutch. Daughter would really like a Mini - perhaps with the CVT tranny. Son is to buy the VW from us outright when he has the money saved up.

So, are we here for encouragement or to get help?"
46	June 29, 2004 10:54PM	anonymousposts	"I think we are here to get a little of both.

I seem to have won this round of the car buying bug vs. my wallet battle. Will be keeping the Accord til 100,000 miles now. The countdown is on ... only 82,000 miles to go."
47	June 30, 2004 1:35AM	rae52	"Well, I've got CCB bad also. My list, starting from high school...

1970 Barracuda-worst POS I ever drove. I guess Assembly workers decided to take the day off when my car was built-too many problems to list
1970 Ply Duster-wore it out then gave to sister
1970 Ply Duster with 318 V8-uncle gave to me when he gave up driving.
1973 Buick Regal-bought used from my 1st boss-over paid of course. Car wore out right front tire; probably due to prior accident

1979 Honda Accord- fine little car EXCEPT underbody was rusting out within 1 winter on NJ's highways
1980 Honda Civic GL 5spd-nice little car until immigrant ran red light and t-boned me at blind intersection with his '78 Ford T-Bird!
1981 Accord LX- fine little car

1989 Olds Delta 88- bought used a used car dealer-off ourse I overpaid-this before internet
1992 Hyundai Sonata GLS- very poor quality and was rear-ended twice--in 6 weeks. Car HAD to go!

My 2 present cars...'99 Civic DX hatch with 5 spd and air. Most reliable and economical car owned to this date
Last car...don't laugh...'02 Cavalier LS coupe. Car is loaded with every bell&whistle and has'nt missed a beat.

Gotta love GM rebates and GM card earnings!!

Geez, if I had the same problems committing to a women, I would be like Julia Roberts in that movie where she keeps leaving men at the alter.

I'm much better off when the car is there, and I do the deal on the spot. If the new car is incoming, I have too much time to talk myself out of or rationalize away the purchase (or just get attracted to the next pretty face).

Sad thing is I could go out and buy a new house with less effort than I spend deciding on a car!"

Do you know how many under $2000 cars in this category there are within 100 miles of here? A bunch! Sounds fun, but it's horrible - I hate looking at cars and worrying that I might make a mistake, or I'll buy a car, and see something better a week later!

I'm not one of those people who spends 6 months researching cars - you can't do that with a used car with a current sale ad, anyway. There's too many choices, and I'm worried that I'll still make the wrong one!

""I hate looking at cars and worrying that I might make a mistake, or I'll buy a car, and see something better a week later!""

The good part about a $2000 Civic or Integra is that if you do find something better they quick and easy to sell."

61	June 30, 2004 9:07PM	anonymousposts	"but after hearing of the latest Honda tranny recall (on top of my growing desire to shift my own gears again) the thought of a Camry SE 4 cylinder with the manual transmission and the SE appearance package (18"" BBS, ground effects, and rear lip spoiler) is beginning to cross my mind. I would be giving up XM radio, leather, and dual-zone climate control but I would gain a manual transmission. The above vehicle can be had for around $20,000. Not bad. I was thinking of trading my 04 Accord EX-L for either a 04 EX-L manual or a 05 EX-L manual but thought that would be a stupid idea. Not that that's ever stopped me before though ...."
62	June 30, 2004 9:18PM	driftracer	"but I'll argue that even though people know people who've had transmission issues with Hondas/Acuras, the ""sky is falling"" routine on their part is a joke. I'm a lemon law investigator and I've seen ONE case in 3 years, in one of the most populated areas of the nation.

Get a manual because you want one - sounds good enough to me if that's your reason for trading! Of course, my car being dirty or low on gas is good enough reason to trade!"
63	June 30, 2004 9:43PM	anonymousposts	"A dirty car is one of the biggest factors in CCB syndrome. There has been more than one occasion where I washed my car and was able to postpone car buying for another month or two.

My husband isn't too fond of the Camry idea (he doesn't like the interior) but wouldn't be too opposed to an Accord 5-speed EX-L or TSX.

OTOH; I drove my Accord to grab some Chinese food today and couldn't get over how much I like driving it with the exception of not being able to shift. The cost-effective thing to do is drive the Accord until the wheels fall off .. I just don't think I can make it."
64	June 30, 2004 10:01PM	driftracer	"and very fun with the manual trans - 200 hp feels just right -

I, personally, would choose the TSX over the Accord or Camry just because of how it looks - it's dead sexy...(nausea-inducing quote from Austin Powers)."
65	June 30, 2004 10:09PM	michaellno	"Tell me about it. I put new tires on my Saturn L300 last week and was amazed by how much more I enjoyed driving it -- the old tires were badly cupped and were making a huge amount of noise. Now, it's the quiet car I remember buying 18 months ago.

However, the wife is currently driving the Saturn on a daily basis and has made noise about trading it in on a VUE when the weather gets bad this winter ...

It's funny, that when I think about it, most of the purchases in marriage #2 (see previous post) were instigated by the wife, not me.

The Escort was leased when she took a new job that required a 15 mile commute and her '86 Tempo just wasn't up to the task.

The Expedition was leased (trading in the Escort) when we woke up one snowy November Saturday and she announced ""I want a 4WD"".

The New Beetle was leased (a month after the Expedition) when the local dealer got a bright blue GL in stock that they didn't add $3000 worth of ""add ons"" to.

Hmm, that's only 3 of the 6. OK, guess I'm just as guilty as she is.

The Explorer was leased (turning in the Expedition early) when we could get the same 3 rows of seats and improve the gas miles from 14 to 18 MPG. My idea to do this.

The Saturn was bought because the lease on the VW was ending and it was my turn to get a car. 0% financing on a car that was $2-4K cheaper than anything else I was considering sealed the deal.

(BTW, we ended up keeping and buying the VW for our son).

The Focus was bought (turned in the Explorer early) when Ford sent us a ""pull ahead"" offer to pay off the last 7 months of our lease. Cut the payment by 45% and almost doubled the MPG. Also my idea to pull the trigger on this deal."
66	June 30, 2004 10:29PM	jlawrence01	"Personally, I wouldn't care if I was driving the same car for 10-12 years. I am sure not going to dump a vehicle that is running well. It is easier to deal with the devils that you know than the unknown gremlins that might be present in a different car.

Anon - I am fortunate. About once a quarter, my wife steals my car and takes it up and gets it cleaned out. To me, having a dirty car is an advantage as it discourages thieves ... It gives them that ""I am not going to do ten years to drive THAT car."" (g)"
67	June 30, 2004 10:42PM	driftracer	Chronic Car Buyers and the rest of you folks. The longest I've ever owned a car was 5 years, and it just about drove me nuts.
68	June 30, 2004 11:22PM	anonymousposts	"The longest we have had a car is 3 years and 3 months. We had a 97 RAV4 that was lease for 39 months and we somehow managed to keep it the entire length of the lease even though we almost traded it a couple of times. We have also had our 94 LS400 for 3 years and 3 months but my husband is contemplating selling it because he has only put 10,000 miles on it in the last 39 months. It is worth mentioning that even though we owned both of those for 39 months the revolving garage door continued around them.

The TSX is most of what we look for in a car. The only my husband wants Acura to add before he buys one is XM radio.

BTW: I am already mostly over the Camry kick. Just doesn't ring my bell interior-wise like my Accord and the TSX do."
69	July 1, 2004 3:46AM	kyfdx	"I came thisclose to buying one in December. I shopped on a Saturday, and was planning on going back on Monday after work, when a previous used car contact called me at work on Monday and we struck a deal for a car that I had given up on.

My second brand new car was an '82 Accord hatchback.. The only power accessory was brakes. Not even power steering or air, or even a right side rear view mirror. It came with an AM/FM stereo (no tape), and floor mats. I didn't sell it until 1994!! 130K and still on the original clutch and CV joints. I bought four other cars in the time I had it, but it was my daily driver right up until the end. The longest I've kept a car since I bought that one is 4 years.

70	July 1, 2004 1:23PM	andre1969	"well, at the end of this September I will have had my '57 DeSoto for 14 years. I bought it back in 1990, when I was still in college. Had no job at the time, but somehow it seemed like I had more disposeable income!

I've had my '68 Dart for a bit over 12 years now...got it April 3, 1992. I still remember the date because it was the day after my birthday.

I got my '67 Catalina in April of '94, so it's over 10 years now. I've only had my '85 Silverado for a bit over a year and a half now, but my Grandad bought it brand-new, around this time of the year, in 1985."
71	July 1, 2004 2:00PM	driftracer	"I bought a really nice 1989 Saab 900S when I was F&I manager at Lithia Honda in Medford, OR in 1998 - the car looked great, had 118k on it, and the used car manager hated Saabs and only put $500 in it.

Nice, dark blue, grey leather, 5-speed car w/roof...

I got it for $600 and owned it just over 36 hours. The next evening after I bought it (Halloween), like a dummy, I ran the car out of gas about a mile from my house and walked home. When I came back with out other car, my wife, and a gas can, someone (kids, I'm assuming) had vandalized the car, breaking every window, beating the body panels, and cutting all four tires. The car was totalled.

The bright side is two-fold: (a) I hadn't really gotten attached to it, and (b) I had full coverage on it and got a $4400 check."
72	July 1, 2004 2:19PM	andre1969	"was my '67 Newport. It belonged to my friend's grandmother, and when she passed away, they simply wanted it gone, so they could get it away from the house, settle the estate, etc. So they gave it to me.

I think it was May or June of '99 when I picked it up. That November, I bought my Intrepid. Decided that I had too many cars (what a concept!) so when the brakes went out on the Newport, I got rid of it. I also owed my uncle money, so that helped me to start paying him back. And back then, I think it cost me about $250 a year to insure, where today, I could get something like that insured for about $25-30!"

I have the inclination to buy something new every few months, but never get the nerve to do it. Just to show you how those of use on the other side live, my list is

1980 Mazda RX-7, purchased in September, 1987 traded in for $500 on a...

1994 Nissan 300ZX Convertible, leased for 36 months in August, 1994. Purchased off of lease, still driving it, now with 122,000 miles. It's in semi-retirement because of...

1999.5 Nissan Pathfinder LE, bought off of ebay motors in September, 2002.

So three cars in almost 17 years, and I still have two of them."
74	July 1, 2004 11:33PM	harlequin1971	"""30 seconds after I drive off the lot, I am already starting to think about what car I will buy next.""

I don't get to pull the trigger very often, but often enough to suit my never-ending need to get into something different. This last one was a bit premature and I have a few regrets, until this last month when temps topped 100 and I reminded myself how feeble the AC was on the 318ti.

Here is my list.

1984? Plymouth Horizon (Auto) - maroon and white. Crashed it my first day with a license. Fixed it, drove it for about 7 months, let my brother have it for three weeks when his truck died. That was the end of the Horizon...it died a horrible death two weeks later (engine seized)

1984 VW Rabbit Diesel (4-spd) - 64 hp and 350+ watts of stereo power. Removed the backseat to make room for the sub box enclosure. (!) Somehow I held onto that thing for almost 4 years. A mishap with a '68 Ford truck put it on the ""do not resuscitate"" list.

1986 Saab 900S (5spd) - Was my pride and joy. It was outfitted with most of the electronics from the Rabbit...had a sunroof, was that cool Malachite green color. A short 15 months later, I had invested $6k in repairs, it needed another $3k and I dumped it for a $4k loss over purchase due to the repair needs. That one cost me big. (I loved that car...and it broke my heart.)

1986 Mercury Sable (Auto) - inherited from mom. It was a tank, handle like crap, had the digital dash and somewhat working AC. Drove it for almost two years until the bills were paid off from the Saab.

1995 Infinit G20 (5spd)- big incentives got me in...electrical issues and a job displacement ended up pushing me out. Sacrificed it to trade only 11 months after buying...

1996 Honda Civic HX Coupe (CVT) - never bonded, but it helped me get through college. Soaked up many miles, got good mpg, the CVT was flawless, no AC and only a moderate stereo. The window regulators failed twice in the middle of MN winters, two years in a row. Was nearly totalled and them dumped when a Dodge Durango used MY brakes to come to a stop on the highway.

1995 BMW 318ti (5spd) - fun, almost sporty, immediately upgraded the stereo to something decent. Burnt out the clutch, but had no other mechanical weaknesses or gremlins. AC was too weak for AZ summers and the black paint looked like a 5-year old had rubbed sandpaper all over it. Sold it when I decided to go back to school for Masters...

2003 Hyundai Elantra (5spd) - reminds me of the Saab, but not quite as ""snooty"" or as eager. Like the AC, stereo is ok, all the added features were hard to pass up and the warranty was just what a school-bound, fixed-income guy needed...then I got a new job offer and put going back to school on hold.

Now I am back shopping. I need to get a condo or house first...but then I am planning to trade up. Depending on the day, I am looking at 2-seat convertibles (from used SLKs to new Miatas), 4-door sedans (G35, used BMW 323, Chrysler 300c, VW Passat Diesel) to wagons (Passat, Legacy) or who knows. The Audi A3, Saab 9-2x, 9-3, and Pontiac Solstice have all had me considering a wait and see attitude. I can't afford to flip cars every year...but I would like to...it is hard not to.

So, while my CCB is under control...I am always looking for ways to feed the habit, like helping friends buy theirs, test driving 6-12 cars a year, and reading Edmunds site all the time, Car and Driver and Road and Track...

not bad I guess, 8 cars in 16 years. Almost a car every two. Guess I am following my keep for 1 year, keep for three pattern.

Plymouth - 1
VW Rabbit - 3
Saab - 1
Sable - 2
Infiniti - 1
Honda - 3.5
BMW - 3
Hyundai - 1 and counting.

Either I am getting ""better"" or I am ""due""

Have a good Fourth."

76	July 2, 2004 12:14AM	anonymousposts	My husband wants to go look for a manual EX-L Accord this weekend. I was thinking a Civic EX 5-speed sedan would suit our needs more. We bought the Ody for when we were all three in the same car so the Accord is just used if one of us goes somewhere with our baby. I think the Civic would comfortabley serve the same purpose while costing $7,000 less and getting better gas mileage. He says Accord, I say Civic. Which is the better car for our needs?
77	July 2, 2004 12:52AM	ghulet	"...I think it's likely I'd be a CCB were it not for...

a. relatively low (or at least erratic, I bartend) income
b. living in the city with cabs, public transportation and high rent
c. I work two miles away and frequently have access to the other two cars in my household most, so combined with a and b and the many bad memories of owning a car equals little justification to own any car right now.

Sigh. If I move away somewhere that necessitates having a car, I'd really just like a nice 4-cylinder, manual sedan, somewhere between a Mazda 3 and Accord. Boring, I know, but I'm a bit jaded, as I haven't had the best of luck with cars; I feel like 99 people could own a trouble-free whatever but I'd be the guy stuck with the 1% lemon. With the exception of my '90 Protege and my '77 Caprice, my cars have been total nightmares. I'd really prefer a brand-new or almost new car next time around.

My list of irritations and heartaches, otherwise known as used car experiences:

71 Buick Electra-paid $450 for it in '85 a week after my 16th birthday, had to put in a water pump soon thereafter. Didn't understand yet that working 12 miles away for $3.35 an hour while driving a car that gets 6 mpg will leave you flat broke in a hurry; sold to a cousin who crashed it into a tree two days later;

77 Caprice-mom bought it for my brother and I in October '86 when she discovered it would be cheaper than trying to insure two 17 year-old boys on her 944 (which actually wasn't even possible). Very good car, bought from original owner with 100k, got me through most of college with minimal drama. By '89 or '90 with 160k, it needed major suspension work, a radiator and water pump, so traded in (VW dealer had a '$1000 for any running car on trade' deal) on....

85 VW Golf 5-speed-pretty reliable, really fun to drive, had the typical VW annoyances of the era (flimsy interior peices, terrible breaking outside door handles, expensive suspension fixes), sold to brother, then had, briefly...

80 Subaru DL hatch-5-speed with non-functioning 2nd and 4th, hole in driver's floor big enough to soak your leg in the rain, no heat; about what you'd expect for the $350 I paid for it, gave to an uncle, bought...

85 Jetta 5-speed-a bit classier than the Golf, really loved it, but again, expensive to fix, my last car for seven years, sold in '91 when I moved to Chicago. Next car purchase was when I lived two miles from the lake, where I could actually park without fear of nightly tickets.

86 Saab 900S automatic sedan-bought for $800, ran great, beautiful body and interior but a real dog and quite the gas guzzler for a 4-cylinder. No heat either, I was to discover. Pretty reliable but typical SAAB repair frequency and cost.

90 Mazda Protege LX 5-speed. Fun, cute, quick, roomy, economical and reliable, one of the best cars I ever owned. Alas, it was stolen and, naturally, recovered sans wheels, tires and my cassettes, ONE day after I bought...

89 VW Golf 5-speed-As nice as the '85 and a bit more refined, but made me recall the heartaches of previous VW ownership (door handle issues, especially). Had to put in a clutch, the car never ran right after that and eventually just died (blew the head gasket, after which the engine seized).

'90 SAAB 900S 5-speed hatch. A nightmare. My learning disability regarding SAABs disappeared after this one. Put in a clutch, suspension work, exterior door handles twice, a window motor, ABS malfunctioned, stuff on this car broke that I'd never even heard of, with alarming regularity. A miserable experience of a money pit, sold to the SAAB repair shop, literally. My last car...

87 Accord DX stick-manual everything, which is what I wanted, bought for $500. About the only thing I put into it was tires, but it used a lot more gas than I would have thought (probably a bad carb) and eventually blew a head gasket. Junked, now happily (relatively) carless.

I think I should have just bought a brand new car in '97 or '98 when I bought that first SAAB! I probably would have spent half as much money and had a tenth the drama altogether. And I'd probably still have that car. Please remind me of this next time I even hint at car shopping!! I think I'm cured otherwise."
78	July 2, 2004 12:57AM	ghulet	"...I think you could look at your situation a couple of different ways. First, the Accord will have side curtain airbags and a bit more collision safety in general, certainly something to consider. Is hubby absolutely insistent on the leather? If not, you could cut a grand or so off by getting cloth (plus, good luck finding an EX-L with a manual trans in any case). If leather is a 'must', I still don't think the difference in price between the EX-L and the Civic EX will be $7000, at least not from the TMVs and 'prices paid' postings I've seen. Of course, if it isn't a priority, then there goes part the incentive to get the Accord anyway (leather being unavailable, as far as I know, on Civics).

You must keep at least one salesperson at your local Honda dealer employed by your purchases alone!!"

Bingo.
I've had the same experience, but since I've stayed away from the exotics, I would have spent the same money, a lot less time, had a lot less fun, and I wouldn't have wanted to miss it.

But then I'm CCBA, which is like AA, except WE don't plan on quitting.

Just out of curiosity, if you had to take a cab to work, do you have any idea of how much it would cost? Also, have you ever walked the distance? I guess that wouldn't be too safe at night, though!

I'm about 3 1/2 miles from work nowadays, and have actually thought about the idea of hoofing it or riding my bike every once in awhile. I could probably walk it in an hour, and ride it in maybe 10-15 minutes? But who am I kidding? I know I wouldn't have the ambition for that!

I've got a friend staying with us now who's trying to go the carless route to save money. He was thinking about getting a job in DC. Only thing is, it takes about 20 minutes to walk to the nearest bus stop, and then another 15, if he catches the bus right then and there, to the subway station, and then God-only-knows how long, to whereever work might be.

83	July 2, 2004 1:18AM	andre1969	"for some reason, over the years, I had just gotten it in my mind that I wanted a certain car, and when I found it, I bought it. For instance, I've wanted a '57-59 DeSoto (preferably a '57 hardtop coupe) ever since I first saw a picture of one, so when I found one for sale, I snatched it up.

I've always been fascinated by the '67 Pontiac ever since I was a little kid, so when I found this Catalina 'vert, I snatched it up, too.

And I've had a morbid fascination with the Chrysler R-body like forever! I bought a high-mileage '79 Newport from the junkyard, which turned out to be, not too reliable, to put it nicely. Ended up ditching it, but regretted it ever since. So when I found a '79 NYer 5th Ave for sale on eBay that wasn't too far away, I was able to satisfy that fetish again!

As for my Dart? Well, I don't know how, exactly, I started liking Darts. I actually hated them when I was a kid. In high school one of my friends had a beat up '72 sedan that wouldn't go over 50 mph. But one day I saw this good looking '69 GT hardtop for sale at a Nissan/Saab/Oldmobile dealer, of all places, and fell in love with it! So much that when it got totaled, I found a '68 for sale the very next day, and about 10 days later it was mine. I really should get rid of it as it now has about 338,000 miles on it, won't start (bad fuel pump I think), and rusted out quarters. But hell, at this point it's become a part of the family!"
84	July 2, 2004 1:21AM	anonymousposts	"The side curtain airbags are VERY nice to have but I wouldn't not buy a car because it doesn't have them. Leather is a necessity for us because my husband (who is 6'6) doesn't fit comfortably in the Accord without the 8-way power seat. Add the XM radio and side curtain airbags on top of that and we see little reason to buy cloth. I just did an inventory search at one of the largest Honda dealers in the south and they have one EX-L manual in gray but it is not built in Japan (a hot button for my hubby).

Here's the price difference according to my calculations:
Accord EX-L manual invoice: $21,637
Civic EX manual invoice: $16,200
Total: $5,400
Then I have to add the difference in sales tax which is 6% .. so that difference is $300.
Total: $5,700
Cost for accessories would be about the same because I would add fog lights, spoiler, splash guards, and fenderwell trim to both.

So I guess the difference is closer to $6,000. It's not that I feel as if the Accord isn't worth the extra $$$. I just don't know if it's worth the extra dough considering the purposes for which it will be used.

Too many decisions .. the thought of a slightly used Passat has also crossed my mind. I am just too afraid of VW reliability to go down that road though."
85	July 2, 2004 2:36AM	badtoy	is the one I'm using now as a work car -- my daughter's old '92 Paseo. i got it for her when she was 17, which was almost 9 years ago, and put it to use when she took over my wife's Celica, so it's been in the family for awhile. Still running strong at close to 200k, and I'll proably keep it another 4-5 years since I'm seriously contemplating putting a larger engine and 5- or 6-speed in it. I just love the size, the styling and the whole personality of the car, and the darn thing was paid for years ago, which means I can spend my car payment on toys instead...

We actually looked at a Mazda6 before we bought our 03 Accord coupe. We loved the way it drove but the deal was better on the Accord. I mentioned a 6i hatch but he said if he was going to spend Accord money he was going to buy an Accord because it has XM and a better engine/manual trnsmission.

94	July 2, 2004 2:53PM	codylabrador	"Back in 1969 I worked at a local grocery store with another guy who had graduated and was going to trade school ( I was a junior in high school). He owned a 1964 Comet S22(?) with a 289 and 4 speed but dreamed of owning a new Dart. I was working to save for a Camaro.

After research (and his claim that a 383 was not as fast as a 340) he ordered a 1969 Dodge Dart GTS, gold with a black interior - no GTS stripe. It had a 340, 4 speed and a 3.55:1 gear. I remember the snakey Hurst shifter. I wound up with a RS/SS 396, 350 HP, M21 4 speed Camaro. Cortez silver with a black interior.

During this time I 285 in Atlanta (hard to believe today!) was unfinished and there were stretches that young men used to ""test"" the performance of their vehicles.

I have to admit that, head to head, his 340 Dart beat my Camaro over a roughly 1/4 mile distance. That car was quick and (he was right) it would outrun the 383s. I loved the sound of that engine - it had that ""hollow"" sound, like it had headers.

I never owned a Dodge, but owned a couple of Plymouths: 1971 225 Duster (Torqueflite, red with bucket seats) and a 1965 Fury III, (a bronze/pink color with a 383 4speed). My dad bought a 1966 Fury III (the car I learned to drive in) and a 1969 Fury new.

Also, I have always been partial to the looks of (and wanted to own) the 1966/67 Plymouth Satellite or a 1969 GTX or Roadrunner."

But, it was 5 1/2 years old and I wanted something ""different and new"". My prayers were answered, when the head gasket went out on it. Yay! Traded it in broken (with dealer's full knowledge, thank you) for 01 Pont Sunfire. Has slider, ABS, stuff other car didn't. But, I'm still looking. Trying to find something I can flip to a dealer straight up. Have my eye on very high mileage 00 Chrysler 300M, but dealer doesn't want to straight trade.

96	July 2, 2004 8:34PM	nvbanker	It's hard to do a straight up flip with dealers. You generally have to take a considerably inferior valued car to do so, or the margin isn't there for the dealer.

In some ways, it is very Lexus-like (in a good way). You could easily take it, put in power leather seats, and sell it as a new entry-level Lexus.

I do occasionally take cabs to work, it's usually $8 or $9 including a generous tip each way. I work five shifts a week, so it would work out to something like $350 a month if I exclusively took cabs both ways every night. Fortunately, I usually have a ride or a car, and one co-worker with whom I share two of those shifts lives four blocks away, so I can sometimes get rides or share a cab with him (his situation is similar to mine; he doesn't own a car but can sometimes use his roommate's).

The walk is actually pretty safe, basically straight north on busy Ashland Avenue, but it would take the better part of an hour, and I'm either running late or just too lazy 99% of the time. I don't own a bike right now, too many have been stolen, even with my U-locks.

So it comes back to just not needing a car. Even IF I had to cab both ways every day, it'd still be about the same cost (or less) than owning a car here. I do feel lucky that street parking is not at all a problem where I live, nor where I work. The keys are staying away from the lake, away from Wrigley field and away from downtown."

Got a whopping $600 in trade, as his GM had about 179,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, engine was knocking a bit, etc. But in retrospect, if he had never fixed that headlight, he probably would've gotten the same $600 for it! :-/

I started thinking about how tempting it would be to trade, but I have to keep telling myself...5 more months and it's paid for!"
108	July 4, 2004 4:24AM	wtd44	Since the first of the year I have not purchased a new car or truck. I traded my 98 Nissan Pathfinder in on a new Kawasaki Drifter. It didn't have that blinding performance thing, so I traded it in on a Honda VTX1800. But I have not bought a new car! I'm really doing great, huh? >;o]
109	July 4, 2004 1:22PM	anonymousposts	As long as you are buying things with wheels and motors you are still diseased.
110	July 4, 2004 3:50PM	eharri3	For awhile after I traded my 95 Ranger 4x2 regular cab stickshift on my new 04 Dakota Quad, I was feeling a little guilt. As in, old truck may have only had two seats, rollup windows, no air, but she still had a few good miles left in her and I being was disloyal to a vehicle that had been good to me to trade her in so soon. After I've read through this thread, the guilt is lessened considerably and I cannot help but think 5 years without my creature comforts was long enough.
111	July 4, 2004 4:46PM	isellhondas	"Anoy,

Trust me on this one, and you can tell gee I said it.

There is ZERO difference in quality between U.S. built and Japan built Hondas. I have looked at thousands of these, literally, and have yet to tell even the slightest of differences in quality or assembly.

I'll get this once in awhile...not often though.

It's a placebo effect, I think."
112	July 4, 2004 4:50PM	isellhondas	"Over the number of cars I've owned and if I were to list them all here (the ones I remember)nobody would believe me anyway.

I've never had a hobby per se but I have owned more cars than I can count.

Often, something would strike my fancy, I would buy it, keep it awhile, get bored with it and sell it, usually at a loss, sometimes not.

So...name a car...any make, challenge me to remember and I'll try to remember the ones I owned."

Peugeot...

1979 Diesel Wagon - It was on a corner with a sign.
1980 Diesel Wagon - Kept it probably six months
1983 Diesel 505 - Neighbor's friend talked me out of it.
1984 Diesel 604 The copper color those always seem to be.

Say what you will about Peugeots...they are wierd, strange and hard to find someone to work on but they are rugged and VERY comfortable cars.

118	July 4, 2004 9:09PM	isellhondas	"Dead and buried. I would never buy another. Mechanics hate working on them and parts impossible to find now.

119	July 4, 2004 9:14PM	nvbanker	"I've heard that. Interesting point - Two brothers in Las Vegas had the only independent Volvo repair shop here for 40 years. They also worked on Peugeots. They had a tremendous following, but got old and retired 4 years ago, and sold the shop which became a Llanteria.

Guess what they both drive now -

The older brother has an Odyssey.
The younger brother, a Sequoia.

That tells me a lot."
120	July 4, 2004 9:25PM	steine13	"About the two brothers.... you know what they say about the cobbler's son. They'll want someone else to work on their cars now...
Peugeots are very popular in Europe; the little 204/205/whatever they call it now sold and continues to sell in big numbers in Germany. Ditto the Megane. That's a tough market for imports. The Diesels are excellent, and they've got a little hardtop convertible a la Mercedes SLK. The main problem with them in America is parts availability.... I don't plan to ever own a rare car anywhere...
-Mathias"
121	July 4, 2004 9:31PM	nvbanker	AMEN to that. I've heard though, that Peugeot is the national car of Chile, or at least, used to be. I'm very mainstream myself for that same reason. In fact, my Infiniti is almost too rare for me. Body parts are somewhat difficult to come by, I've found. You can get 'em, but it takes a while. They're not available everywhere.
122	July 4, 2004 9:42PM	isellhondas	"I sold one of the wagons to a couple who decided to stop for dinner afterwards. It got dark while they were in there and they guy called me after ten minutes of trying to figure out how to turn on the headlights!

125	July 5, 2004 6:37AM	jaserb	"'74 260Z. $350. Brown with rusted wheel wells. Could never get it to pass inspection due to an exhaust leak - I was 16 and couldn't afford a new exhaust manifold. Dude who bought it put a Ferrari body kit on it!
'82 Chev Camaro. Black. Bought it with a blown 2.8 V6, Dad and I swapped in...another 2.8 V6. Dog slow, but it was a Camaro and I was in high school. Sold it after the 3rd TH200 tranny went out and the rebuild shop said they wouldn't warranty it any more.
'74 260Z. Blue. Kept for almost 8 years, loved that car. You name it, I replaced it at least once. Necessitated:
'73 240Z, '74 260Z (Parts cars). I actually sold the 240 to my cousin, who got it back on the road.
'84 Firebird. Red. Bought it while I rebuilt the engine on the Z. That car hated me, but it looked cool. Still gutless with the 2.8 but at least it had a 700R4 tranny.
'99 Neon Sport. Super duper blue. First new car. Peppy with the DOHC motor and the 5 speed. Only major problem while I had it was the sunroof. Note to self: never buy an economy car with a sunroof. My brother wanted it so I sold it to him, on the condition he buy an extended warranty (he did, and boy has it gotten used!)
'97 S10 pickup reg cab, white, long bed, 2WD, Auto, V6. Great little truck. Drove it from 90k to 100k miles and sold it for more than I bought it for. Moved us into our house in 2 loads - 4 years later it'd take 200 to move us out.
'01 Hyundai Santa Fe LX FWD. Maroon. Been a good little family hauler. Wife likes it a lot and at nearly 50k miles it's still going strong.
'98 S10 5 spd EX cab, 4wd. White, mostly. Bought at an auction, regretted it immediately. Had been absolutely pounded and put back together w/junkyard parts. Learned the value of CarFax. Took a bath.
'87 Alfa Spider Quad. Silver, beautiful. Owned for a little over a year, learned to double clutch and swear in Italian. Spent more time under it than inside it. I want another one!
'93 Sentra SE-R. White. Bought last year with super low miles when the Alfa started demanding too much of my limited time. A blast to drive and rock solid for the 20k+ miles I've put on it so far. Maybe too reliable?

Lets see, that's 4 ratty Z-cars, 2 early 80s V6 FireMaros, 2 S10s, a Neon, a Hyundai, an Alfa, and an SE-R. 12 in 12 years. Sounds like I need to sell the SE-R for a beater truck and another Alfa or maybe an MGB. I've always wanted a TR6... How much does a nice 240/260Z go for these days? Or is it time to trade in the Santa Fe on an MPV, or maybe a quad cab pickup. The Honda SUT would fit the bill for the wife. Then again, I'm just finishing my MBA - a WRX wagon would be a nice present to myself. An RX8 would be nicer!

Of course, there's the minor problem of She Who Must Be Obeyed, and who doesn't like cars nearly as much as I do...

We had a 99 Accord EX 5-speed that was Japanese built and never had a rattle or squeak to speak of. The same can be said for our US built Accords as well. What can I say though .. he makes more money than I do.

As for your challenge to name a car .. how about these ..

Sterling
Toyota Corolla FX16 GTS
Alfa Romeo Milano .... Gee tried to buy one of these when he found a 2 for 1 deal (one to drive and one for parts) but he didn't fit

nvbanker: I want some of everything. I can't believe a manufacturer has yet to make an AWD mini-van that has a manual transmission, looks like a sporty coupe, handles like a S2000, and is as reliable as an Accord DX. With XM radio I might add.

That's one HUGE thing in the Accord's favor right now. XM. No other sedan offers XM and all of the Accord's other virtues.

The vehicle that was the most ""fun"" to drive was the 1955 Ford V8 Stick Shift, with twin exhaust and ""glass packed mellow tone mufflers"". The next vehicle of choice was the 1956 Olds two door hard top, (also with glass packed mufflers). It had power and ride. Not many vehicles on the road could touch the 1956 Olds. I witnessed many ""drag races"" between a 1955 Ford and a 1956 Olds. The Ford would have the Olds ""off the line"", but if the race was long enough, the Olds would pass the Ford like it was going backwards! Yes, bring back the ""good old days"" with the ""Hot"" cars and the ""drive - ins""! A 1956 Olds in mint condition could give some police cruisers some competition today in the speed / acceleration department. A driver could cruise with this vehicle at 90 MPH, and feel like he / she was doing 60 MPH. They were heavy and powerful and they had a 4 speed Hydra-matic Transmission.

Looked at a Sterling once until I realized the only good thing about it was the Honda engine and transmission.

The only British cars I've owned were a 1960 MGA when I was in college and a 1974 MGB probably five years ago.

Fun cars but typically British with all of the headaches that go with them.

Anything else?"
130	July 5, 2004 3:16PM	wtd44	The last 20 or so posts have been therapeutic for me. One strong lacking in it all (eat your heart out, isellhondas!) is Renault, so let me point out that two of my most favorite cars to have in my personal history were my mid 1950's Dauphine and my purchased-new 1969 R-10. By the way, a dauphine is the wife of an oldest son of a king of France. A worthless factoid for one and all, eh?
131	July 5, 2004 4:25PM	stickguy	"'67 Camaro (high school, first car). Sounds good, but for $300 you get 6 cyl and a powerglide. But it did have the custom lightening kit (aka most of the rear fenders and trunk floor had rusted away). This was the first and last AT car I owned (not counting my wifes minivans).
'73 Duster 6 cyl
'70 Nova 305 V8(my only V8 car), never registered (had a starter problem, but came with a spare hood).
'74 Gremlin X (actaully really liked this car).
'75 Opal Manta FI (money pit, spent more time on a tow truck than every other car combined).
'75 Corolla E5 (my fist five speed)
Now, I graduated college finally, so first brand new car!
'85 Dodge Colt GTS (not the turbo, but the tires, suspension, etc.) Best hadnling car I ever owned, next to a Miata. Had Yoko A008 tires that stuck like glue, and worthless in snow).
This part gets a little fuzzy, but I think I can remember everything (not that I want to).

Mathias alert: some stuff in here you might not buy.

'86 Mazda 323 LX (family car). Colt replaced with a series of bombers:

'8X Subaru GL? (3 door) w/a bad exhaust
'75 Celica, 175K, terrible rust (but I sold it for a profit!)
'85 Civic S (fun, but ran hot).

Finally decided to act like a person with a real job (plus, with was getting real annoyed).

'90 Nissan king cab pickup. Lasted one year (unexpected baby showed up, wouldn't ride in jump seats)
'91 Mazda 626 LX 5 door (one of my favorites)
'95 Mercury Mystique V6
'99 Maxima SE
'01 Miata (purchased 11/03, still have but for sale)
'05 Scion tC (4 days old already!)

ALong the way, wife replaced '86 323 with a '92 Subaru legacy, followed by a '96 Voyager and a '99 Quest that we still have, but Wifee wants to replace by year end.

132	July 5, 2004 4:26PM	autonut	It all started when I was about 16 years old. My father and I started to search for a vehicle that would be my very first car. This was 1986. We were looking through the classified ads in the newspaper and found an ad for a 1966 Mercury Comet Capri. We went to look at it and I fell in love. It was a typical northern car with the rust and really bad bondo repair. I was still in love and it would be my project (or so I thought). My dad payed $400 and I payed $400 for grand total of $800 for the Comet. The Comet was Jamaican Yellow with Black interior. The interior was in great shape and it ran well with the 200 6 cyl. and automatic transmission. I did some work on the car in the summer and spring and it was stored away in a neighbors garage in the winter. My dad suprised me by having a friend of his take the car and re-do the body work and paint it was my 1987 Christmas gift. I couldn't wait for spring to finish it off and drive it. I was very happy with the Comet. Well I drove the Comet until 1988 or 89 when she met her demise with a jump of the RR tracks the unibody broke, I couldn't find a safe fix and I needed wheels. I traded her in for a 1986 Ford F150 Flareside with a 6 cyl and a 3 spd on the column. I had it painted metalic blue. Now I will start the list. 1979 Ford Thunderbird. 1986 Dodge Omni GLH. 1991 Dodge Colt (My first New Car). 1969 Corvette. 1988 Mustang GT. 1995 Ford F150 S/C Flareside P/U. 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier Z-24 Convertable (Lemon Lawed). I don't remember the year of the next one it was a Chrysler Maserati TC (Piece of crap). 1998 Honda Civic EX. 1997 Ford Expedition. 2000 Ford Focus ZX3. 2001 Ford Ranger S/C Edge. 2002 Ford Ranger Reg. Cab. Edge. We also have a 2003 Honda Accord Cpe. I am now trying to hold back my urges for a new car. HELP!!!!!!

jaserb: the TR6 was designed by Michelotti (an Italian designer) and is easily one of the prettiest cars of the period -- it still looks substantial and fresh today. It also had the best exhuast note this side of a Ferrari. However, they were typically British in their fragility, and you need to be really careful to check one out completely before commiting your rent checks to one. Good luck!"

If I did buy a TR6 it'd have to be red, with the Union Jack on the rear quarter panel (as a lot of them do, it seems.)

The first one was a black 87 (bought in 96 or 97) that the previous owner clipped the stock springs on. It was a screamer. He sold it at 160,000 to a pizza delivery guy who is still driving it. Last time he saw it the car had 260,000 miles and was going strong. Then he found a silver 88. He drove that car for several months until he found a 92 Acura Integra in need of a good home. I think he still regrets selling both of them but he has been unable to find one in the right color that was in decent shape since. One thing though is that both of them had head gasket leaks. Not sure if that was an inherent problem with the FX16 or not.

isell: We wanted a Sterling for a minute. Until we realized that they were hardly a shining example of Honda quality. Amazing how much difference there was (quality-wise) between a Legend and a Sterling.

x02167: You are far from alone.

It's interesting to see the different range of cars some of you have owned. I feel like all of my cars have been basically the same even though there have been lots of different cars. But the few times I have strayed from Honda/Acura I lived to regret it. The only exception being when I bought a Toyota/Lexus. My heart really wants a BMW but my wallet is like nuh-uh.

154	July 6, 2004 7:28PM	harlequin1971	"There are entirely too many choices out there, new and used. My wants are a little unrealistic though. I want a fun-to-drive, reliable, safe car with side curtains, and I would LOVE to pay $15,000 or less.

I bought a Hyundai Elantra GT hatch. Fun to drive, lots of extras, good interior space, decent mileage, and my 2003 has not dropped like the rock everyone told me to expect. In fact, recent JD Powers and Consumer Reports are ranking the Elantras high, it placed second to the Protege in 2003 in a 11-car C&D test...has good looks, enough zoot and the 5-speed is decent.

Might want to check them out. Only ? is the safety, but side air bags are standard, ABS is available, and that crash test that smeared their rep in 2002 was on the older style and the weak rail defect was fixed in the seats. I would put the car up against anything close."
155	July 6, 2004 7:44PM	anonymousposts	I will be the first to admit that Hyundai has come along way. They have shot themselves in the foot a couple of times but they are still headed in the right direction. However, while I would no longer tell anyone not to buy a Hyundai, I don't think I am quite ready to jump over to the Hyundai camp. Who knows what will happen in the next 5-10 years though.
156	July 6, 2004 7:46PM	driftracer	"If it's an '03 with that 5-speed, book is around $9,700, real money is $6,000-6,300. Depends on what size rock you're talking about.

It's a good idea to leave the resale value portion of a discussion out when comparing apples to oranges, and Hyundais to Hondas..."
157	July 6, 2004 8:27PM	harlequin1971	"do a search in my zip code and you will see them still booking at +$11k.

Sounds rediculous, I know...but a guy was pushing a 03 - 5spd off his lot for $12,500 (about same miles) which is $100 more than I paid for mine new...

I could easily get $10k for mine...though I ain't planning to drop it just yet. Besides, once you start comparing, where else can you get all those goodies, decent mileage, and a sticker south of $20k?

I am gonna work hard to hold this puppy until at least the release of the 2006 models...too many cool cars coming down the pipeline.

Considering that someone said it would be worth $4k less after the first year, a 20% drop in 16 months is not that bad a deal.

MSRP $16k
Bought at $12.5k
Market value $11k
16 months of ownership.

31% drop off MSRP (Which is large)
12% off purchase (which is pretty good for the first 16 months.)

Even at $10k, I only lose 20%.

No one will get this car away from me for sub-10k. No dents, long warranty, has worked perfect, I have every record, every gas tank fill...no racer mods...just a good car.

Again, it's best to leave out the REAL WORLD resale values (not the pie in the sky ideas from the books) when comparing that car to others in the segment.

""Besides, once you start comparing, where else can you get all those goodies, decent mileage, and a sticker south of $20k?""

Sentra, Civic, Corolla, Focus...many, many more.

""Bought at $12.5k
Market value $11k""

Bought at $12.5k, real world trade value around $6k now. Sure, you could retail it and maybe get $8500-9000, but nothing near the $11k someone is ASKING.

Sorry to harp on this, and I certainly mean no offense, but to compare the Elantra head on with the Civic, Sentra, and Corolla isn't a correct comparison."
159	July 6, 2004 8:52PM	harlequin1971	"obviously, a used car lot's retail price is the not the only (or best) indicator of value, but here are some local (PHX) cars on the net:

2002 GT Hatch - 47k miles $10,997
2002 GT Hatch - 24k miles $10,000
2002 GT Hatch - 39k miles $8,000

All autos (5-spds are rare) - all 1-year older than my vehicle.

For the record, no hatches even listed for 2003-2004.

Comparing apples to oranges is no good, you are right. The Honda that would sell new for $12.5 is the DX Sedan (If you could have wheeled the price down) and had absolutely none of the options: Air, leather, CD player, alloy wheels, power windows, doorlocks, security system, sunroof, cruise control, spoiler, and fog lights....

But then, the resale (regardless of whether you enjoyed the ownership experience) is good, right?

2002 Honda Civic DX Sedans
26k miles $12,700

Seems like that is the only one I could find...

I would still rather buy the Elantra GT new or used over a Corolla or Civic.

Apples and Oranges indeed...appliance versus a more enthusiastic approach to basic transport.

Sorry if I seem testy on this, but Hondas are the not the end-all-be-alls of transport that some people still cling to. Reliability has fallen back to the pack (with everyone quickly catching up), decontenting has reduced their cars to souless, featureless vehicles until you drop your aftermarket money to upgrade them.

I owned a HX Coupe, it was a good car, very few problems...but not problem free...certainly no better than my Elantra, was more expensive, and had far less creature comforts inside, including no AC.

In the end, I didn't even get to enjoy the great resale, as a car accident with a Dodge Durango ruined my car's value - and then the subsequent vandalism all but killed its value.

How cheap can you buy a Honda EX in the market? Do you think you will ever get that $6k extra back from the market to still get a less equipped car? Value leaders...pishaw."
160	July 6, 2004 8:53PM	harlequin1971	your bias is showing...and sadly, it is outdated.
161	July 6, 2004 9:05PM	driftracer	"hmmm...I do 50 Hyundai lemon law cases per month in the greater Philly area - I've done a total of 12 Honda cases out of 4,800 in 3 years - I think any bias you detect is greatly deserved. In fact, it's the automatic transmission-equipped Hyundai Elantra that's first on the leader board with repetitive transmission failures.

I don't think it's outdated, considering most of the cases I see are '03 and '02 cars.

""2002 GT Hatch - 47k miles $10,997
2002 GT Hatch - 24k miles $10,000
2002 GT Hatch - 39k miles $8,000""

Again, those are retail ASKING figures and are pretty meaningless - even the $12,700 on the Honda DX is useless, since it's a retail number.

I'm not about to turn this into a Hyundai discussion, but considering my CURRENT experience with CURRENT models, both seeing them come through local and regional auctions and passing through in lemon law cases, even given the useful, well-equipped nature of the cars, I see no point in spending my money there.

Yes, I'd spend more on a Sentra, Corolla, or Civic - and I'd get a better car with better resale, better handling, more solid feel, etc.

I'm NOT an appliance buyer - in fact, I feel sorry for people who buy cars simply for A-B transportation. I'm an enthusiast, and the ""whole car"" experience means the world to me."
162	July 6, 2004 9:07PM	harlequin1971	"i don't want to fight with you about this. Your end may be to hold values down...but the market seems to see some value in the car.

There is no way I will EVER trade in a car to a dealer. I am not fond of handing over $4k to anyone.

When I sold my BMW, I was offered $3k for it in trade, list was $9k, sold it (had already bought the Elantra, so was getting nervous) for $6800 two days after I dropped the price from $8k.

At $6800, I still netted $3800 more than the trade ""offer"" and the car could have sold on a dealer lot for $9500 easy. (Was low miles, no real problems besides a scratchy paint job that could have likely been buffed and polished to look great again.)

I don't think you can be a CCB and afford to trade cars in to dealers. So take the trade in value and toss it aside. I look at dealer prices and I think my car is holding nicely. I would sit my car next to a same year, same mile Honda Civic DX any day and sell it without hesitation. It is a better deal for the buyer...longer warranty, more goodies, and at a discount...done deal."
163	July 6, 2004 9:14PM	harlequin1971	"it's the automatic transmission-equipped Hyundai Elantra that's first on the leader board with repetitive transmission failures.

well, I do have the 5-spd. I drove the auto and it stunk. Since anon is looking at manuals, I could reccommend it.

As for handling...I think the GT handles as well or better than any Corolla or Civic. Mount the Tibbie anti-sway bar to the back and it gets even better...we don't need to argue it anymore. You deal with lemon laws...so maybe your perspective is valid on this...but I also think that some of that is born out of expectations. My car has 13k miles and has only had one issue re-occur, the tape under the spoiler keeps unpeeling and sliding down under the spoiler when it gets washed in a pressure wash. Had a problem with my radio - replaced. A tweeter blew out - replaced. The battery died - replaced. Faulty clutch-ignition switch regulator - replaced.

Maybe the fun is just ahead...but I am satisfied that my car is handling AZ just fine. (BTW - my BMW went through 2 new batteries in 2 years in AZ.)"
164	July 6, 2004 9:17PM	anonymousposts	"In all fairness, you can get a Civic EX sedan w/ side airbags and a 5-speed for $16,200 according to carsdirect.com. A comparably equipped Elantra GT is $13,800 if you use the $1500 rebate. Granted the Elantra will have leather, fog lights, and traction control over the Civic EX but the Civic EX has much better crash test results according to www.iihs.org. The Elantra is rated poor while the Civic receives a good rating and is a best pick.

As for resale, according to www.kbb.com these are the values for 2001 models with 45,000 miles in good condition.

2001 Civic EX 5-speed: $9245
2001 Elantra GT hatch 5-speed: $5960

So that's a difference of $2400 at purchase time but after 3 years if you were to trade your car in you would have made back that $2400 and saved another $900 were you to have purchased the Civic. Add fuel savings to that and the Elantra looks less and less like a bargain compared to the Civic.

Personally, there is no dollar amount I can put on the safety of my family. Sure there may be safer cars than my Accord out there but according to NHTSA and IIHS the Accord is one of the safest cars you can buy for the money. If I were buying a small car I would want the same thing. Therefore the Elantra would be ruled out.

""decontenting has reduced their cars to souless, featureless vehicles until you drop your aftermarket money to upgrade them.""

That's subjective opinion. For my $22,000 my Accord EX-L has dual-zone climate, power seat, leather, sunroof, CD changer, heated seats, XM, alloy wheels, ABS w/ EBD, etc. I feel like I got plenty of car for my money especially if you consider, again, the crash test ratings. Souless? Maybe. But I would rather have a souless car that is going to protect my 3 month old than have a car with soul that failed to protect him."
165	July 6, 2004 9:29PM	harlequin1971	"that is the Accord (EX no less)

That is not fair to compare their mid-level car to the econo entries.

Just stick to the level-level comparisons. Econo car versus Econo car. I don't know how, but I have reduced to the guy fighting for the honor of his car of choice. That sucks. I try to say something nice and kablam!

As for the accident results...what year was the Elantra test from? I don't think they have retested since 2002, when the tested car had a failure of the seat track that allowed the seat to move forward (broke free) and a faulty switch on the airbag that caused a late deployment.

Hyundai said they could not replicate either failure, nor did they have samples of either failure in any of their own tests. Nonetheless, they beefed up the seat tracks in the 2004 models and I wouldn't doubt that they combed over the airbag switch relays with a fine-tooth comb. Anyone have a current crash test for an Elantra?"
166	July 6, 2004 9:35PM	driftracer	"the Elantra with an overall poor rating on a 2001 model. A ""poor"" rating on a 2001 doesn't inspire confidence in a 2003 or 2004 model - although some model year differences and changes, the basic skeleton, subframe and passenger enclosure is the same.

I don't even get into crash test results because I don't buy small cars. I buy trucks, SUVs and performance cars. I'm on the ""after"" portion of the car market, daily seeing auction and retail sales results, as well as lemon law cases and the trends they show.

To be forthcoming, crash test results don't factor into my line of work at all, but they would if I were looking for a sporty commuter car or a new car for my kid."
167	July 6, 2004 9:40PM	anonymousposts	"Most of my comparison was between the Elantra and the Civic.

However, you made a blanket statement that said all Hondas were featureless, souless vehicles. That statement, in the context with which it was used, included my Accord. I never made a direct comparison between the Accord and the Elantra. To do so would be unfair.

Time to get back to the fun conversation that this was intended to be.

For today I am not considering selling my Accord. Any want want to guess how long it will be before I have another epiphany?"
168	July 6, 2004 10:27PM	harlequin1971	"yes, the 2001 Elantra GLS was tested. Check out why they scored poorly. It was not intrusion, or any body/compartment issues. The seat track buckled and gave way, causing the driver to slide forward into the compartment and getting severe ""injuries"" to knees and head. That was coupled by an unsatisfactory deployment of the air bags, something Hyundai claims they have been unable to duplicate.

The link is here: http://www.iihs.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0103.htm

Structure/Safety Cage - good
Head injury potential - poor (airbag)
Chest - good (seat belts and seat performed well)
Left and Right Feet and Legs - Marginal (injuries due to hitting bolsters - seat malfunction)
Restraint - poor (seat track malfunction)

Basically, the driver may have some concerns about the airbag systems, but the critical child protection information (intrusion and integrity of crash cage) rated as good. I am not saying that this is perfect, but this was also conducted on the car before it's mid-cycle redesign in 2004.

YMMV.

Anon - when I said Hondas, I meant to imply the Civics - I shouldn't have left off that word I guess. The Accords are nice and plenty of content for price...that just isn't the case with the Civics. Forget alloy wheels, forget good stereos, forget most basic luxury amenities. You can't even option most things onto the cars. Toyota is worse...you have to option the crud out of them to get them at the content level most people want/expect...and the price suddenly is no bargain.

Mazdas are nice, but no better resale, no better performance, and only marginal improvements in reliability.

Honda Civics are great appliances. They run pretty well. But they don't have that ""above the crowd"" reliability or feature content anymore. Almost every manufacturer is giving you more for the dollar up front, without the big losses in back.

I doubt you will truly make up the differences in a Civic EX over an Elantra GT. Maybe you would...but I doubt it, personally.

In the end, buy what you like. Don't listen to me. I am impressed with the Elantra. It is every bit as nice as the Infiniti G20 I once owned, without the electrical gremlins. It is much tighter than my 7-year old BMW was, minus some of the zoot from the RWD and efficient tranny of the 318. It is loaded with luxury amenities that I could have never expected out of a Honda Civic within $4k of the price ($12.5 sticker) or any other econo model offering that wasn't Korean.

The downside is that Hyundai still seems a step behind in engine/tranny development from the big boys...the can't seem to find that sweet spot of power and effeciency just yet. But the car itself has been a pleasure.

BTW - my rear-ender with the Dodge Durango gave me neck and back injuries that I get to live with for the rest of my life (minor, but present) - so good or not good...I don't think the capital H gave me any real advantage that day. Two weeks later my co-worker t-boned a Buick in her Civic on a country lane (he pulled out in front of her) and had serious injuries to her feet, knees, and hip. She was in a wheel chair for 3 months and had to relearn how to walk with permanent screws in her feet holding the jigsaw puzzle of broken bones together.

Good or no good, the margin isn't as broad as we might hope.

If you want safety, a new car sub-$15k is no way to seek it out. Better off buying a used Volvo S60."

The '58 Fireflite had a 361-4bbl with 305 hp. My '57 originally had the dual exhaust through the bumpers, but at some point before I bought it, the exhaust was replaced (it needs to be replaced again) and the pipes were just run straight out the back, under the bumper. Running them through the bumper contributed to rust, as it would let moisture accumulate where the pipes bent upward. Still, it must have been really cool, back in the day, to see the exhaust smoke coming out of those bumper ports, like a jet fighter or something!"

179	July 7, 2004 4:04PM	harlequin1971	"I can fight about my car choice somewhere else, and would prefer. Maybe you are right. I really don't care.

Forgive me for suggesting a low-priced alternative to the Honda that has WAY more goodies. I like my car, so do the many Edmunds owners that post to the GT threads. I guess that is how Hyundai stays in business, making decent cars for people who don't buy into Honda and Toyota's strangle hold on the econocar market.

I don't mind their cars. But I don't see my dollars going into their coffers. Far too many cars on the market with more appeal to me than the vehicles they are making. Acura and Lexus do make a few intriguing models, and if I could afford one, an S2000 might be interesting for a year or two...but let's drop it.

As for Isell...we have tangled before. You don't like Hyundais, that's fine. I wouldn't imagine anything Hyundai pre-2001 gathering much attention. But we will just have to wait and see about the market for my car. Hyundai has had straight growth over the last four years, so much so that they are investing millions to build a new plant here to make cars (like Honda has done and so many others) so I think their success has only begun. If they ever catch up to Honda's engine and transmission engineering (some years spent in the WRC should help that) they will no longer have to take a back seat to anyone.

In the end, I don't care. I bought the car because it offered the most for the least. I needed the warranty in case I did go back to school. I have been happy with the car. Doesn't mean that I wouldn't prefer others. I have no problem recommending them to others. I would buy a used one long before I would consider a used Honda and the premiums they bring in."

It is akin to the link between alcohol and aggressive behavior. Not every alcoholic is violent, but many violent people are more violent after drinking.

I buy cars. I spend hours reading magazines about cars. I spend hours in here posting about cars. I go to dealer lots and deal with scummy (and some really professional) salespeople just to test drive cars that I will likely never buy, but may end up suggesting to others. I upgrade when I rent, just to get a better car. I considered working at the PHX Mini dealership, just so I could drive that car for a while. I once sold VWs and Saabs, so I could drive a different car to lunch every day. (This was back in the days of the Corrado VR6 and the 9-5 Griffin.)

I have opinions. I like what I like. Some don't agree. Most of the cars I have had have been good to me and I have lost more of my money to repairs, taxes and high interest rates then to depreciation.

I am scratching the itch to buy right now, because I can't pull the trigger for at least a few months and shouldn't pull it for a few years, unless I dump new for old and get a hoopty ride for a while.

185	July 7, 2004 10:00PM	jlawrence01	"There is one wise statement that a poster makes around there parts every week or so ...

""DRIVE WHAT YOU LIKE.""

We have our own goals. I like to buy vehicles that are unpopular but are reliable and drive them until the wheels fall off. I like to see how cheaply I can purchase a decent car, and see how long I can keep the car running reliably while keeping my costs as low as possible.

That means that I generally drive the oldest cars on the lot at work. So what?"

If so, I don't remember and I don't think we ""tangled"" this time either. I firmly believe people should buy and drive what they like and I have said so many times in these forums.

I only responded stating my opinion on their resale values."
187	July 7, 2004 10:48PM	brightness04	Sounds like the two of us will make a good team ;-) I own the car for the first 70k miles, then pass it onto you for good price. My line of work makes it necessary for me to have an extremely reliable car (plus a backup); being late or missing an appointment due to car breakdown is simply not an option :-( Otherwise, I wouldn't mind an old car either. It all comes down to how much marginal income additional car expense generates for you. I figure, a brand new $30k Toyota/Honda depreciates about $3k a year in the first 6 years when averaged out, with minimal repair cost; year 6-12 probably depreciates $2k per year, but probably another $500 a year repair bills; beyond year 12, it's anyone's guess what the repair bill is. If not having to visit the dealer on unscheduled basis is worth the extra $500-1k a year (with about $2500 a year on gas and insurance, that will be $5500 vs. $4500 a year), a new car makes sense; on the other hand, if a car breakdown means an opportunity to call in ;-), I'd keep the money myself. Also, depending on what state you live in, exrcise tax could be a deal breaker on new cars.
188	July 8, 2004 5:47AM	jlawrence01	"Let's get a few things straight. I have had very few breakdowns with cars up to about 150K miles because I am religious about my maintenance. For example, I replace tires after three winters with 40% of the treadlife left.

I bought my current car at 38k, hit 98k tonight coming back from Milwaukee. The car broke down on me once because I cancelled my appointment with my mechanic for the new battery and tuneup that I had. By the way, on my Olds, I have averaged under $500 a year total (LOF, tires, repairs, etc.) driving 18k per year. I budget about 0.06 per mile and i am running under that.

As many old cars as I have owned, I have never missed a day due to car problems. I have always had 2-3 backups ""just in case"".

In Cleveland, I had a close relationship with a Enterprise guy who would rent me a car for $18 with 10 minutes notice. I also had a guy (with a newer car) who owed me a few rides in casr. (At the time, I owned three cars with 120k miles.)

Here in Chicago, I have the Enterprise option, access to a bus or train (both require a mile walk each way). People who want to make it to work generally do.

In general, having a third car as a backup (with two drivers) is generally a losing proposition when you have the insurance, taxes, title, etc. Also, there is no guarantee that when one has problems, the other will follow.

I will admit that mytime is less critical. Where I work, we all work half-days and it doesn't matter if it is 6-6 or 9-9."

190	July 8, 2004 12:38PM	andre1969	"have you ever had a day though, when more than one car went down at once? It's been really rare, but on a few occasions I have. One really hot summer day, back in 1999 I'm thinking it was, my Gran Fury decided not to start. It would turn over, but just wouldn't fire up. Had my roommate drive me over to my grandma's house to get her '85 LeSabre to use, and damn if it didn't flood itself out too!

I'm guessing it was just because it was an extremely hot, humid day. Anyway, I finally DID get the Buick fired up, but I just thought it was funny that they'd both quit on the same day! The Gran Fury positively refused to start, so after messing with it for a few days, I finally tied it to my Dart and pulled it down to Kmart, which did auto service back then, and was actually fairly reputable (ours was, at least). Anyway, damn if it didn't fire right up for them!

I had another multiple-car catastrophe the following winter. I'd only had my Intrepid for a few months at this point. It had just snowd a night or two before, and there was packed snow and ice everywhere. Well, somehow I picked up a nail in my grandmother's driveway, and my Intrepid's front tire went flat...almost immediately. So out came the trusty Buick...which I promptly got stuck on the ice at the base of her circular driveway! Needless to say I was a little late that nite delivering pizzas!"
191	July 8, 2004 1:21PM	jlawrence01	"I had one day in Cleveland where ALL three vehicles were having problems. It was a January day in 1998. +10F during the day, -10F at night. I had a '89 Ciera with 135k, a '80 Topaz with 120k and had just bought my next door neighbor's '89 Corsica with 105k to keep her out of bankruptcy.

My wife came home complaining about the alternator light going on the Ciera. She had to be at work at 4:30am. I was fortunate to get the Topaz started (unheated garage). She took that to work and called Sears to get a new battery. I took the Ciera and was able to get it the one mile to my mechanic.

I walked the one mile home and took the Corsica to work. Two miles from work, the heater core went out. I took it to my mechanic near work and called Enterprise for a rental. This was a real PITA. However, it underscored the need to stay ahead of repairs with older cars.

After that fiasco, I sold off the Corsica to one of my wife's employee. After that, I worked with Enterprise wheneve I needed a short-term rental. He agreed to provide me with a vehicle on short notice if I agreed to take whatever he would give me. I ended up with an Aspire one time and a Ford F-150 pick-up the next.

The biggest problem with the third car approach is that when you have a problem, you don't move on it quickly as you have immediate backup."
192	July 8, 2004 1:26PM	stickguy	"One of my best excuses to get a new car and feed the CCB habit.

How concenred I get depends on which car. My car is generally local/commute (1 mile), so it isn't crucial that it be stone reliable (that is, I could get away with an english car if I wanted to). But, my wifes car (van now) if the family truckster, and takes all the long trips. And take my word for it, you don't want to break down on the Belt parkway or the Cross Bronx expressway in NYC at night.

When I'm doing a 300+ mile trip, highway, nights/weekends (which they usually are), it's not going to be in a car that I worry about making it.

In JLs case, sounds like a different story usually (more like my situation around town)."
193	July 8, 2004 1:28PM	stickguy	"since I bought a car, and I'm getting the urge again (at least thinking about it). Is this a problem?

Good thing I have plans to shop with the wife for a new family car in the next few months. That should keep me from doing anything for at lest a year or 2, unless I come up with some lame excuse first."
194	July 8, 2004 1:58PM	andre1969	"now that I rarely drive very far anymore. Back when I used to deliver pizzas, and lived about 13-14 miles from my regular job, reliability was much more critical, although to be honest I did most of my delivering in a '68 Dart, '79 Newport, and an '89 Gran Fury, and occasional stints in Grandma's '85 LeSabre. I'd only had the Intrepid about a year, when I finally got fed up and quit that job. I tried to go back twice...once for about 2 months, and once for one month. But it just wasn't the same, management was going downhill, business was dropping, etc.

But now, I'm about 3 1/2 miles from my job. The grocery store is less than 2 miles away, and there are two gas stations along the way. Reliability, while nice, really isn't that crucial anymore. I'm almost tempted to going back to buying clunkers once the Intrepid drops, or just start using up some of the ones I already have!"
195	July 8, 2004 2:22PM	stickguy	"Andre - get the HEMI. You know you want it.

Good article in the latest Automobile magazine about a road trip to Florida in a Magnum RT. Sounds like a really nice car, if you like big cars.

I have actually gotten tired of having 3 cars, largely because I only have a 2 car garage, and hate parking outside. That, and it's real expensive to insure a sports car in NJ. Kinda not fiscally prudent when I will barely put 1K a year on it (I only do 6K/year total on my cars).

If I ever move to someplace like New Hampshire, I'll buy a house in the country with an extra detached garage to stach toys in."
196	July 8, 2004 2:32PM	seminole_kev	If you know you're not going to put hardly any miles on a car, why not get an older car and get classic/collector car insurance. Really a good deal for a car that's not going to be a daily driver and will sit for most of the year. Saved a boat load of cash using one of these policies for my old car.
197	July 8, 2004 2:34PM	andre1969	"I definitely want the Hemi. I just don't want the car payment that would go along with it!! I just read in a recent C&D or MT though, that Chrysler is planning on offering a 2-door and convertible version of the 300, as well as a 2-door and 4-door version of the Magnum, and something else that will revive the Charger nameplate.

I hope this happens...I'd like to see a return to the days when car lines had a full model lineup to choose from, with coupes, sedans, convertible, and wagons."
198	July 8, 2004 3:24PM	jlawrence01	"In Cleveland, it was a PITA to break down as I commuted 25 miles out to the suburbs for my job. There was no public transportation. The situation here in the Chicago suburbs is a lot better in terms of the options.

As for long trips, when I get into a situation when my car is older, it is better IMHO, to rent a car. For example, I can get a $20 per day car for an overnighter from Chicago to St. Louis. Why put the wear and tear on my vehicle. And if I can rent at a suburban location, I pay a 5% sales tax versus the Boss Daley 24% tax that you get renting at O'Hare and Midway."
199	July 8, 2004 3:38PM	andre1969	"just renting a car whenever I need to go somewhere far away. However, the last time I looked into renting a car, I think for that trip it would've cost about $600! I would've been driving from DC to Houston and back, putting at least 3,000 miles on the car for the whole trip, and it would've been about an 8 day trip, total. The car I was trying to get was a Pontiac Bonneville, as I didn't think I could put up with a little car for that long of a trip...about 22-24 hours, if you drive straight through.

I did have a '91 Civic rental once, while on vacation in California, and I think I put around 1500 miles on it while I had it, but it wasn't all put on in one long trip!"
200	July 8, 2004 3:52PM	driftracer	"they don't charge mileage, so you're dealing with a weekly rate and that's it. I've done that recently when I went to the SEMA Show in Indianapolis in March. Rented a Cadillac Deville, cost me $129.00 for 4 days...got better mileage than my PT Cruiser by 5-6 mpg!

When I didn't have a brand new car, I rented cars for weekend trips all the time."
201	July 8, 2004 4:24PM	andre1969	"I can't remember who I called for the Bonneville, but I do remember that they offered unlimited miles on their cheaper little cars, just not on the nicer cars.

And my Intrepid ain't no spring chicken anymore. I'm pushing 94,000 miles, so my '79 NYer, with only about 88,000 on it might be the more trustworthy of the two now! ;-)"

203	July 8, 2004 5:22PM	stickguy	"giving my wife a beater and having to hassle with rentals when we travel (often on short notice) truly qualifies as a ""non-starter"", but I can see the attraction for city dwellers and single folks."
204	July 8, 2004 5:28PM	andre1969	was looking into renting a Chrysler 300 (don't know which series, so it could've been a base, C, touring, or limited), and they quoted him at something like $125 per day! I dunno which rental company it was, though. I'm going up to the Carlisle PA Mopar Nationals tomorrow morning, so maybe I should rent a 300 and put it on the show field! ;-)
205	July 8, 2004 5:37PM	driftracer	or National - they seem to be the cheapest around.
206	July 8, 2004 5:53PM	ghulet	"....last time I rented, which admittedly was four years ago, I did an internet check of some sort and National was had a deal on their full-sizers. I rented a Regal LS, including mileage and insurance, for a round-trip from Chicago to Phoenix (via St. Louis, Oklahoma City, the TX panhandle, with a stop at Grand Canyon), which also included out-of-the-way jaunts to Muncie, IN and Nogales, right over the Mexican border from Arizona. I was glad I bought the insurance, as I got a flat in Amarillo and had to trade the car in the next morning instead of driving on the mini spare; got a Bonneville for the remainder of the trip.

Anywho, we put a total of nearly 6000 miles on the two cars in ten days. Rental and insurance totalled ~$350, IIRC, which I thought was a damn good deal (and a lot better than taking the trip in either my '86 SAAB or my ex's '84 Accord). Both rental cars had the 3.8 V6 and got nearly 30 mpg highway, even with liberal a/c use and a very full car on the return trip."
207	July 8, 2004 8:04PM	jlawrence01	"1) Enterprise DOES charge for miles on some of its rates. They offer a $9 a day rate (based on a 3 day rental) on weekends that includes only 100 miles per day. When I rent from them, I always verify whether or not mileage is included.

2) Rental rates depend on the market. In the past year, I have rented a full size for as little as $18 (LAS, LAX) to as much as $45 a day. That does not include either taxes or insurance (which is covered by my current policy).

3)I rented a Olds Ciera for FOUR MONTHS in Orange Co. for $3200 in 1993 and drove it for 15k miles in SOCAL. They were not real happy about it but I liked THAT car. I let them do service every 3500 miles on the weekends when I went home.

4) National and Alamo in Las Vegas have the right idea. When you rent, after they get all the info at the counter, they send you to the canopy of teh size of car that you rented. You get to pick whatever car they have in stock. For example, rent a full size and YOU can choose from the 10-12 different models that they have at that time. THAT is a cool idea.

5)On my last road trip, the rental Impala averaged close to 34 mpg over the 3000 miles I travelled (mostly interstate).

6) For true car addicts, there are several agencies in Las Vegas that rent exotics. Have your wallet open as it tain't cheap."
208	July 8, 2004 8:12PM	andre1969	"I had to take a business trip to California, and the rental company sounded like JLawrence's #4. My company approved a car in what I think they call ""midsized"" class, and I had my choice of several Centurys, Grand Ams, and Aleros. I ended up picking a green Alero coupe.

I thought that was cool, being able to pick a car that I liked, in a body style I liked, and a color I liked!"
209	July 8, 2004 11:15PM	jlawrence01	"The ""pick your own car"" is a great idea. It costs the car company nothing incrementally and you eliminate the ""why does he get that and I get this"" argument at the counter.

Alamo in Las Vegas had a minimum of five different models for all classes. National had a lot of choice AT THE HIGH END. For compacts, they had whatever color Cavalier you wanted. They had an Saturn Ion that I wanted to try BUT they had a ""do not rent"" sign on it. I was tempted to wipe off the chalk and take it but knowing my luck, it probably had mechanical issues.

Under that system, had I been taking a road trip as opposed to just driving around Clark County, I would have upgraded 2-3 levels and chosen between the premium vehicles because their rates were in the low $30s for that week."

212	July 9, 2004 4:20AM	brightness04	Being in the city is definitely a big help in terms of backup plans.

Talk about being paranoid ;-)

We are about 50-60+ miles from the nearest Benz dealer and with so many ""specialists"" it would probably take us a minute to find one we trusted.

You are worried about a long shot, **potential** transmission problem in your under warranty Accord? A problem that will more than likely never occur but you are willing to take a chance on a 148,000 mile Camry or much worse, a trouble prone, high miles Mercedes???

Did I REALLY read this right???"
215	July 9, 2004 8:23PM	anonymousposts	"Difference is this, every mile I put on my Accord depreciates it. The warranty is nice, for now, but at the rate I am driving the Accord will be out of warranty before the end of next year. I have almost 19,000 miles so I am only covered for another 17,000 miles. In the unfortunate even that this Accord has a transmission failure out of warranty and with no recall to support it I am out several thousand dollars for a tranny. Now I know Honda would probably step up and at least cover half as long as I can show proper maintenance but even half would still cost me a couple thousand $$$. However, the depreciation I would experience from the high mileage and the thought of a possible transmission replacement combined with my desire to drive a manual anyways are all fueling this decision. I would rather part with it now than part with it later at a much higher expense. I have no problems with the Accord. I love it to death. Might even buy another one (manual transmission of course) when our 04 Odyssey goes back in 21 more months.

The Camry has a $15,000 window for repairs. Do you honestly think a well-maintained Camry will require $15,000 in repairs in the few months I would own it? The Benz I will admit is questionable. But I've always liked them and for $5000 I still have wiggle room should it need repairs.

Besides, I have moved on past the Benz an am thinking about putting our 94 LS400 on the road. Then we would only have 3 cars and be a little more ""normal"". We have only put 10,000 miles on it in 3 1/2 years so it's time it did some work."

There may be some truth to that. My husband and I have been happily together for just over 9 years. This theory may warrant an investigation ...."

229	July 14, 2004 12:26AM	andre1969	"I thought I had broken myself of this bad habit, but something just came along to tempt me. Back around the beginning of the year, a guy in one of my Mopar clubs had a 1980 Cordoba LS that he wanted to sell. The LS is the sportier model, which had a more slicked-back front end with a crosshair grille, and had (dunno if this was standard, but this one has it) bucket seats and a console/floor shift.

Well, we'd been emailing back and forth for awhile, but money's kinda tight on my end right now, as I recently moved, but ran into some problems getting my old condo rennovated so I could put it in the market.

Well, I told him that I really wouldn't be able to do anything until I got the condo sold, and he said he didn't mind. I just told him that if another offer came along, don't blow a sale on my account. I hadn't heard from him in awhile, so I figured he ended up selling it.

Weeelllll, today I checked my email, to find a message from him! He still has the car, still for sale. My sensible side is telling me to say no, but it's been almost TWO YEARS now since I've made any changes to the fleet!

Anyway, it's a 318-4bbl with a TF727 automatic tranny, and it has a 3.23 suregrip 8.75 rear end out of a '69 or '70 Charger. Dual exhaust, 15x7 copcar rims in back and 15x6 copcar rims up front. Body looks good except for one rust hole down low on the quarter, under the rear side window, and a broken piece of plastic trim in back. He has a replacement part for that, though. And one of the metal brake lines in back blew. I think the window arm in the driver's side door is messed up too, although he has a spare door. All of this can be mine for a $2300 asking price.

I'm 'fused! ;-) What should I do?"
230	July 14, 2004 1:30AM	stickguy	What, are yo looking for instructions on how to write a check? Can't help you there, since my wife won't let me near ours!
231	July 14, 2004 12:58PM	anonymousposts	"If you want the car and can afford it then you should go for it.

As for me, tomorrow I will be trading my 04 Accord with 19k for a 1997 Honda Civic sedan with 85k. Only paying $3500 for the Civic and they are giving me $17,500 for the Accord. I won't have to worry about the Civic dereciating due to the high miles we put on our daily drivers, it will get 40 mpg, and it will be paid for. Once the Ody goes back off lease we will probably buy a TL or TSX 6-speed with NAV."
232	July 14, 2004 2:16PM	michaellno	"The good news is that the registration goes down each year. The state has implemented a sliding scale for the personal property tax. Each year, the percentage of the taxable value goes down, so the longer you keep your car, the better it is.

 

Since we plan on keeping our current fleet for the forseeable future, the $1000 that we are paying this year to register 3 vehicles will drop by $100-150 next year, and so on.

 

Plus, the personal property tax amount can be deducted from your income taxes if you itemize.

 

Still and all, it's better than the $700 we paid the first time we registered our Expedition in 1998!"
233	July 14, 2004 7:53PM	lemko	...didn't DeSoto build a car called the Sportsman? If so, is it rarer than the Adventurer? What model name did the last 1961 DeSotos carry?
234	July 15, 2004 2:08PM	andre1969	"""Sportsman"" was just a name that DeSoto stuck on their hardtop models. I'm not sure what year they started it, but my '57 Firedome has it on it. It wasn't a separate model or trim level, though. Basically, all the hardtop models were Firesweep Sportsmans, Firedome Sportsmans, or Fireflite Sportsmans. I can't remember if the Adventurer had ""Sportsman"" on it, as well. And dangit, as many Adventurers as I saw at Carlisle, I didn't even think to look...you should've asked me that last week! ;-)

In 1961, the cars were just known, officially, as ""DeSoto"", and were only offered as a 2- or 4-door hardtop. I have heard that a few of them had ""Adventurer"" trim, which might have been from the 1960 Adventurer (which was really more of a slightly cheaper Fireflite than the ""real"" high performance Adventurers of '56-59). I've also heard that a cross-ram 383 with 330 hp was available in '60 and '61, but had to be special ordered.

Standard engines in '60 would have been a 295 hp 361-2bbl or a 305 hp 383-2bbl. In '61, the base engine was a de-tuned 361-2bbl with 265 hp.

As for rarity, I think the rarest DeSoto, post-war, at least (and not counting specialty stuff like limos, ambulances, hearses, etc), is the 1958 Adventurer convertible. I think only 82 were built."
235	July 15, 2004 2:25PM	lemko	"...are you familiar with the comic strip ""Shoe?"" The characters are birds and one, an old owl with glasses, drives a 1959 DeSoto."
236	July 15, 2004 2:55PM	andre1969	"I remember that comic, but I haven't read the comics in ages. I don't think the Washington Post carries ""Shoe"" in their comics section anymore. Around 1990 they did a little ""updating"", retiring some of the older comics, and I think that was one of the ones that got dropped."
237	July 15, 2004 3:08PM	stickguy	"A character in the ""Pirannah Club"" strip (formerly known as ""Ernie"") drives a Desoto also. They tend to rag on it quite a bit, but it's quite funny.

Only a true CCB would pay more attention to the cars in a comic strip than any other aspect."
238	July 15, 2004 3:27PM	andre1969	"that had a cop with a rabbit sidekick who drove around in a 1960 DeSoto, but I forget the name of that strip.

I also tend to remember when they mention/show different cars on tv. I'll never forget one episode of ""Too Close for Comfort"", with Ted Knight. In a flashback episode, Ted and Muriel were sitting together in his '55 or '56 Ford convertible, gazing up at the stars. He mentions that he's thinking about getting a new car.

""What kind?"" Muriel asks.

""Oh, I don't know,"" Ted responds.
""DeSoto..."" (no response from the audience) ""...Studebaker..."" (a little chuckle from the audience)
""...Edsel."" (bigger chuckle)
""You can't go wrong with one of those! (bigger laugh)

BTW, speaking of cars on tv, does anybody know what kind of car the sherrif on ""The Waltons"" drove? It was a big, 4-door touring car. Looks like mid-late 20's, and quite prestigious (although by the Depression it wouldn't have been!). I caught part of that show this morning, and they showed the car."

240	July 18, 2004 4:49PM	anonymousposts	I am off the wagon again .. just 3 days after trading my 04 Accord automatic for a 97 Civic it looks as if we are considering maybe possibly considering thinking about maybe taking the Civic back and leasing a 2004 Accord EX-L manual transmission. So far the dealer is saying $21,900 (before doc fee) for the car including spoiler, fog lights, fender trim, splash guards, and premium mats. Going to offer $21,700 including the doc fee and see what they say.

But...hey, it's your money!"
244	July 19, 2004 10:57AM	anonymousposts	"Well .. we did it. We leased the 04 EX-L stick. This car should hang around for a while because we all know you aren't going to get out of a lease cheaply.

The 97 Civic was nice and all and it got terrific gas mileage but it had some transmission issues. There was a rattling, grinding type noise every time you changed gears from 2-3 and it would reappear sometimes once the revs got up past 4000 RPM.

Overall, it was a nice car but when we combined the tranny problem with the car not having latch (we were using my husband's 03 Si as the daily baby carrier) the option of leasing a new Accord started looking more attractive. We had already started missing my automatic 04 and we considered almost every used option and kept coming back to another Accord. Here were the top contenders:

1995-2000 Volvo 850/S70: wanted a stick, sticks are hard to find in this car. Not sure what year they started using LATCH in these either.

1998-2000 Accord EX 5-speed: Didn't start using LATCH til 2001 and my husband didn't like the 2001 refresh

1996-2000 Honda Civic EX 5-speed: Again, they didn't start using LATCH until 2001 or so and my husband isn't too fond of the rear styling of the 2001+ Civic.

With the lease support the Accord will end up being about the same over the 3 year period as the cars listed above. I know we will have the residual in addition to payments but the way I see it, we would've gotten another car in 3 years anyways had we bought any of the cars listed above.

Am I making sense or am I just a hopeless CCB?"
245	July 19, 2004 11:00AM	anonymousposts	We have lost a couple of times but we have also made money before so it's probably a wash. This last Accord hurt more than usual but I blame us for putting so many miles on a 2004. Had the mileage been more in line with what they expect on a 2004 I wouldn't have lost that much money at all.
246	July 19, 2004 3:05PM	kyfdx	It is the latter.
247	July 19, 2004 3:35PM	harlequin1971	"I think I can understand and agree with your decisions.

You just bought the Civic, but discovered that it may have some tranny issues you did not expect? Am I following so far?

So, you went back to your Accord, but ditched the less desired auto for a 5-speed? If I was in the market, $21900 for an EX-L 5-speed sounds pretty tempting...(holds back urge to pick up a phone)...but I am NOT in the market right now.

Ughhh."
248	July 19, 2004 3:50PM	anonymousposts	"You are right about the Civic. It was a great car but the possibility of a transmission overhaul made it not such a good deal.

After all things were considered the Accord seemed like the best car for our needs. The dealer wouldn't take the $21,700 .. guess I can't really blame them considering invoice is $21,600 and we had all of the accessories added on. So we paid $21,900 and will be going to pick it up this afternoon."
249	July 19, 2004 4:28PM	andre1969	how much would a tranny overhaul on the Civic have cost?
250	July 19, 2004 4:44PM	anonymousposts	We were quoted $1200 by a Honda/Acura specialist.
251	July 19, 2004 6:04PM	perna	"is your obsession with LATCH. Sure, it's cool and all, but is the seatbelt really that big of a pain?

If it sounds like I don't know, well, it's because I don't. My 03 Max has it, wife's 01 Escape had it, and her new 04 Explorer obviously has it too. It's neat, but with most car seats don't you just sort of leave the whole thing in there (for the larger ones) or the base (for infant carriers)? I've only un-""LATCH""ed one of our cars, and that was when the Escape went bye-bye. Can't you just leave the seatbelt wrapped around the base/seat?"
252	July 19, 2004 8:58PM	nvbanker	is why you dumped the 04 Accord in the first place, given where you are now..... I think you may win the allstar CCB award for this move...

-Mathias"
254	July 19, 2004 11:02PM	harlequin1971	"in the end - cars can be looked at so many ways...

But I think the only way a CCB can look at them is as a monthly expense and any possible upside down destruction to bank accounts.

I look at motoring as a monthly expense, since I doubt I will be able to ""settle"" into a single car longterm until I can afford something a bit better than econocars and already 5-year old used gems. Once I get 3-years down the road, it has been too long.

I did a comparison with my friend a few months ago. He has owned nothing but low-priced junkers for the last 10 years. His purchase prices are next to nothing, he runs them as low-cost as possible, minimal repairs, etc.

In the last 10 years, my cars have always had nice stereos, got good gas mileage, didn't need too many unplanned repairs (except the Saab) and were safe to operate. None of those things could be said for his cars, except the mileage on a few (old-model Civics).

In the end, I spent an extra $150 or so a month on payments and maintainence and about $400/year more for insurance. But then, I never knew the joys of inserting screw drivers into the heater switch to turn on the heater, or using duct tape to plug up small leaks along the window seals. I did get to drive one of his junkers a few winters ago. I can say that if I was in that heap when the Durango rear-ended me, I would have been MUCH worse off.

I would love to learn the discipline of a 7-9 year ownership cycle, but I doubt I will ever make that. Too many upgrades to safety and convenience that keeps making it hard to backtrack.

Heck, I am mad that my car can't plug in a MP3 player into the stereo or receive satelite radio without significant upgrades.

I doubt they lost much on the used Civic. It was a low-cost temptor to begin with, IIRC. Now, if anon comes back next month with a trade in and rebuy scenario to dump the EX...it may be time for an intervention."
255	July 19, 2004 11:17PM	nvbanker	Ain't that the truth!~
256	July 20, 2004 12:55AM	anonymousposts	"We have 4 cars. Sometimes we may put the seat out of our Accord and into the SI and when we can flip the seat around it might end up in our LS400 once or twice as well. But it's more than a convenience issue. It's safer as well. It's more secure and there are less ways to make mistakes while installing the car seat. A seat CAN be properly installed without LATCH but it's much easier and more fool-proof with LATCH. There has to be something to it because as of Sept 1, 2002 it was mandatory in almost all passenger vehicles.

257	July 20, 2004 1:13AM	anonymousposts	"We traded my automatic 04 Accord for the 1997 Civic before we knew the Civic had tranny issues. The automatic 04 was gone, when I signed paperwork to sell it to the dealership I signed agreeing that it was a final sale whether I kept their vehicle or not. When I returned the Civic we were left with the Odyssey and the Civic Si as our daily commuters. The Ody is a lease and with the distance we drive it is not feasible to use it as a commuter. The Si is a great commuter but falls short in the baby-hauling department. With our rear-facing seat in the back behind the driver's seat my husband can't drive it and with the car seat behind the passenger the passenger front seat has to be pushed almost all the way up so it's almost impossible for anyone to sit in the front passenger seat.

I got rid of the Accord mainly because it was an automatic. I loved the car otherwise but thought it was foolish to spend money for something that wasn't exactly what I wanted. So I decided to minimize my loss and get out of it now while the miles were somewhat respectable for a 2004 car.

After we figured out we were not going to keep the 97 Civic we exhausted all of our acceptable options in the used car market and came up empty-handed. The cost of this 04 EX-L manual over 3 years is going to be $12,900. That won't buy you alot on the used car market, especially when we were limited to 2001+ because of our above-mentioned preference for LATCH.

However, I guess all the justification in the world can't hide the fact that our car addiction fueled this thought process. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel, both the Accord and Ody are leases so they will be with us at least another 36 and 21 months respectively.

258	July 20, 2004 4:07AM	lancerfixer	Just so's you know, LATCH actually didn't appear in Volvos until the new models (S60, new V70, S80) but they DO have these great built-in locking clips for the seat belts on the '98-'00 S/V70 that make putting the car seat in and securing properly a breeze. Of course, we've got two cars and two sets of seats, so unless I carry adult passengers (rare,) the car seats don't come out of the S70. You're right about finding a stick, though. Not easy to do. I finally gave up and bought an auto, which with the turbo actually works quite well; it actually shifts about 90% of the time when I would have anyway. Besides, if I'm ever jonesing to row my own, I can still steal Mrs. Lance's Accord. :-)

263	July 20, 2004 4:03PM	andre1969	"A lot of Ford designers and stylists bailed and went to Chrysler, before even Lee Iacocca did, so that's the reason that a lot of late 70's and early 80's Mopars had a strong resemblance to Ford products.

This one originally had a slant six which would have put out a whopping 85-90 hp in 1980! But it also has bucket seats and a floor shift, so it was still trying to be sporty! It now has a 318-4bbl (but I don't know what it came out of, or how much hp it has), a Torqueflite 727, and a 3.23 suregrip 8.75 rear end out of a 1969 or '70 Charger.

267	July 20, 2004 4:15PM	andre1969	"And proportionally, this Cordoba is probably about the same as a 1977-79 T-bird. Chrysler supposedly ""downsized"" them for 1980, which is the same year Ford downsized the T-bird to the Fairmont chassis, to compete with the Monte Carlo.

Still, I think those old personal luxury coupes were about 215"" or so and usually rode a 114-116"" wb, pre-downsizing. By 1980 the T-bird and Monte were down to about 200"" overall, on fairly trim 108"" wheelbases. The Cordoba/Mirada were still battlecruisers though, at around 210"", on a 112.7"" wb. So Chrysler's downsizing wasn't nearly as drastic as Ford and GM's, which is probably one reason they sold so poorly when the second fuel crunch hit."
268	July 20, 2004 4:17PM	andre1969	"yeah, it's a Cordoba, but it's the cheaper Cordoba LS model, which sported a more slicked-back front-end and a crosshair grille. The ""regular"" Cordobas had a much more formal, upright waterfall grille."

270	July 20, 2004 5:24PM	stickguy	Any problems getting that baby inspected, with the engine swap and emissions control ditching, or does MD not bother with inspections on stuff that old?
271	July 20, 2004 6:07PM	andre1969	"actually go back to 1977. Originally, I think they only went back like 15 years; I remember the first emissions test I had to go through, in late '87 IIRC, they said that 1973 and older models were exempt. And the next year it moved up to '74, but for some reason they got stuck at 1977.

Anyway, in MD, once a car hits 25 calendar years of age (for example, on January 1, 2004, all 1979 cars were eligible) you can get historic plates. Now with historic plates you don't need to get it inspected and you don't have to take it through the emissions test, but you're not supposed to drive it all the time either. But with something that age, it's not like I'm going to drive it everyday, anyway!

The guy who's selling it lives in MD, and he said that it passed emissions the last time he had to go through. I think as long as the catalytic convertors are there (and they are), the typical emissions station worker isn't going to be smart enough to notice the Lean Burn is gone, or the difference between a slant six and a V-8, just as long as it passes. And the test it has to pass by is pretty generous. I remember when I took my '79 Newport in for testing, with about 230,000+ miles on the clock, it passed by a wide margin. In fact, some of the numbers actually looked good by modern car standards!

Now the down side is that if I buy this car, I won't be able to tag and title it with historic plates until January 1, 2005. But the way this year feels like it's flying by, that'll be here before I know it!"
272	July 20, 2004 6:20PM	nvbanker	"(besides me) the Iacocca ad campaign that introduced the Dodge Mirada/Chrysler Cordoba twins? ""It'll drive you out of your Bird"" was the tag line. I thought it was pretty clever, as they were clearly redrawn 77 T-Birds."
273	July 20, 2004 6:30PM	andre1969	"but supposedly the Cordoba and Mirada got a lot of good press from the buff rags at the time. While they'd all probably be considered rather baroque cars when viewed from a modern standpoint, the Cordoba/Mirada was actually considered quite sporty, when compared to something like a 1980 Monte Carlo or T-bird. When I was a kid though, I really loved the hidden headlights on the '80 T-bird, and still remember the commercials showing the digital speedometer, which was way cool to my 10 year old mind. But looking back, there's just something frumpy about the '80 T-bird, and the '80 Monte is still just too French-curvy! In contrast, the Mirada and Cordoba (LS, at least) were probably about as sleek and sporty as you could make this platform, which was essentially a heavily rebodied Volare!

That year you could still get a high-output 360 that put out around 180-185 hp, which should have been able to get them from 0-60 in under 10 seconds. I know that sounds sad, and laughable by today's standards, but in 1980 things were so bad that the Chevy Impala 350 was actually disqualified from the bid process, either by the Michigan State Police or by the CHP, because it couldn't pass their minimum 0-60 requirement! I think it was timed at something like 13 seconds in 0-60.

The Mirada/Cordoba 360's were probably the closest thing to a musclecar that year."
274	July 20, 2004 6:45PM	driftracer	"got 2 new Malibus and a Z-28 in 1980, all with 305s. The chief got the Z-28, for ""pursuit"" purposes...yeah, right, in West Columbia, TX, pop. 3,350 !

Anyhoo...we dogged those guys with those gutless cars - all of the officers ended up flipping the air cleaner lids and they made some pretty cool sounds - one officer told me ""at least it sounds like I can catch you""!

The Z-28 got wrapped around a tree about 2 months after purchase. Seems the chief was trying to catch up with one of my classmate's '73 Z-28, big block, tunnel ram....Penske-style suspension..."
275	July 20, 2004 6:51PM	andre1969	"I've done the same thing with the 305-4bbl in my Granddad's '85 Silverado. Makes it sound SOOOOO much better!

Even with a 350, those downsized Malibus really didn't make very good police pursuits. I have a police car book that has some results of a test between a 1979 Malibu 350 and a 1979 Volare 360....
0-60: Volare 8.7 seconds, Malibu 8.9 seconds
0-100: Volare 22.7 seconds, Malibu 28.2 seconds (IIRC). So it seems they were close at first, but the 360 just had more top end oomph.

Supposedly the old Nova police package, which saw its last year for 1978, was much better than the Malibu that replaced it."
276	July 20, 2004 6:55PM	lemko	"...there were a few other car I may have purchased before sanity/fiscal responsibilty/ reality got in the way. I'm sure a lot of you guys can recall those cars that got away. The cars that got away from me are:

1950 Buick Roadmaster
1958 Oldsmobile 88
1975 Ford LTD Landau
1978 Cadillac Sedan DeVille
1979 Cadillac Fleetwood limousine
1979 Cadillac Coupe DeVille
1979 Mercedes-Benz S450
1984 Cadillac Sedan DeVille
1986 Ford LTD Country Squire
1986 Mercedes-Benz 420SEL

Does anybody also have family that consider you as a prospective buyer of unwanted vehicles? My Dad tried to convince me to buy his old 1991 Ford Aerostar and 1997 Mercury Mystique. Yuck!"
277	July 20, 2004 7:00PM	driftracer	"was lighter and quicker.

I still, to this day, don't know how the police chief of West Columbia, TX got city council to approve a Z-28 for the town. Of course, Bill Wiggins, owner of Bill Wiggins Chevrolet, was on city council...maybe they got a great deal, or Bill just wanted to see what municipal sales would do for his retail allocations.

I graduated with Bill's son, Jay, who now owns the place, plus the Ford store in town (a 100 car dealer group!), and Jay and I took the Z-28 out to play before the police department got it. We thought it was a dog, too!

See you in Macungie on August 7th!"
278	July 20, 2004 7:11PM	andre1969	"that I got from friends and family members. They were my:

1980 Malibu coupe (Mom held onto it when she bought her 1986 Monte Carlo, because she knew I'd be getting my license and needing a car soon)
1988 LeBaron coupe (bought from my uncle after I got married)
1986 Monte Carlo (again, Mom's)
1985 LeSabre sedan (Grandmom's, she gave it to me when she could no longer pass the eye test)
1967 Newport hardtop coupe (friend gave it to me after his grandma passed...the family just wanted that eyesore gone so they could get her house ready to sell)
1985 Silverado (Granddad bought it new, Grandmom gave it to my Mom a few years after he passed away, Mom gave it to me when she bought a new F-150)

I've also had a few that I wanted to/came close to buying, but let 'em get away...

1978 Pontiac Catalina, 400 (my 12th grade English teacher's; she only wanted $500 for it!)
1980 Olds 98 coupe, 350 (when I totaled my first Dart, this is one of the cars I was considering to replace it)
1980 Dodge Mirada, 318 (another car I was considering, but this one was ragged out)
1965 Buick Electra hardtop sedan, 401? 425? (found it in the auto trader when I smashed my second Dart's suspension, and would have bought it, except that I ended up being able to fix the Dart myself for about $75!)
1965 Chrysler Newport hardtop coupe, 383 (found it in the junkyard, just came in, pretty good except for a bum tranny. could've had it for $400)
1968 Dodge Dart GTS, 340 (the same junkyard had it for sale for about $1400. I would've bought it, except that I had just bought my second Dart about 3-4 months prior, and had already sunk some money into it)
1958 DeSoto Firesweep 4-door, 350-2bbl (for sale north of Baltimore, near the PA state line. Could've gotten it for about $800, but someone else beat me to it. At least I got to drive it,though!)
1983 Olds 98 coupe, 307 (a co-worker at Hecht's was trying to sell it, for something like $700-800. It was in good shape except for a bum heater. I would've bought it, but didn't want to get rid of my Cutlass Supreme, which I thought I was going to keep forever at the time. It blew its engine about 2 months later...)
1973 Travco 220 Motorhome, Industrial 440-4bbl (Saw it at autotrader online, fell in love with it. Thankfully, once I saw it in person, common sense got ahold of me... It really wasn't bad for $2900, but a 27 year old motorhome, or ANY motorhome, was the LAST thing I need!!)"
279	July 20, 2004 7:13PM	andre1969	"so you're going to Macungie again? Cool! Hard to believe it's been almost a year, already!

I dunno if this is true or not, but I heard that, when the CHP was considering using Camaros as pursuit vehicles in 1980, they got a test run of them, but the factory workers, who saw the black bodies with white doors coming down the assembly line and immediately identified them as Five-Oh, deliberately sabotaged them as a way of getting back at the police!"
280	July 20, 2004 7:15PM	lemko	...you've reminded me of another car that got away. When I first got out of college, I considered buying a used 1983 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency sedan. That baby was a beautiful Firemist Gray metallic - a very classy, stately looking vehicle. I ended up purchasing a new black 1987 Chevrolet Caprice Classic instead.
281	July 20, 2004 7:18PM	lemko	Are you guys planning on going to Macugie? So was I! I haven't been there in four years.
282	July 20, 2004 7:30PM	andre1969	Yes!! If you're planning on going, let us know if you want to meet up somewhere! Grbeck and I went there in 2002, and in 2003 we met up with Drift there.
283	July 20, 2004 7:51PM	jlawrence01	"Didn't they make the Camaros in GM's Norwood, OH (Cincinnati) plant?

Why would they care about the CHiPs speeding prevention program?"
284	July 20, 2004 7:52PM	driftracer	"lemko, drop me an e-mail and I'll shoot you my cell number.

Texas was famous for using Mustangs as state strooper pursuit cars - they were flat out mean. When the square body style stopped in 1993, TST went to Camaros, but the officers didn't like them as much - getting in and out of a Camaro with a flak vest and weapon/gear belt isn't something I'd want to do, either.

I was in and out of vehicles with more gear than that (infantry harness with 240 rds of ammo), but we used trucks for the most part in USAF Security Police..."
285	July 20, 2004 7:55PM	andre1969	I think they also made Camaros at a plant in California. I forget where exactly, but I think it was a plant that already had a rap for poor quality, and was ultimately closed down and then became the NUMMI plant when GM and Toyota tried that joint venture. I want to say Freemont CA, or something like that?
286	July 20, 2004 8:06PM	kyfdx	"I think you are right... Camaro/Firebird made in both Norwood and Fremont.

kyfdx"
287	July 20, 2004 8:09PM	lemko	...was Van Nuys. Anyway, I do know where the Malibu/Classic is built - Newark, Delaware. I wonder if the Olds Cutlass clone was also built there?
288	July 20, 2004 8:34PM	nvbanker	Was there a Mustang GT for 1980? I can't remember. How about an Z-28 Camaro?
289	July 20, 2004 8:36PM	driftracer	The Mustang GT didn't happen again until the 1982 model year. Dark times for car enthusiasts...
290	July 20, 2004 9:09PM	nvbanker	And IIRC, the Z-28 was really watered down with a 350, or was it a 305 that year, and a 2 bbl...?
291	July 20, 2004 9:09PM	andre1969	"there was still a Z-28, which I think put out 170 hp in 1980. And there was a turbo Trans Am, that had a Pontiac 301 that I think had 190-200 hp, and was decently quick for the time, if it didn't blow up!

Maybe by then the distinction was blurring, but I still considered those cars more as ""ponycars"" than ""musclecars"".

For the most part, I don't think GM did much in the way of building muscular downsized intermediates, at least not until the likes of the Grand National and 4-4-2 and Monte SS started hitting the streets in the early 80's. There was a Hurst Olds Cutlass from like 1978-80 that had an Olds 350-4bbl, but it only put out 160 hp. And the Buick Turbo V-6 started popping up here and there, in some Century, Regal, and even LeSabre coupe models, and the 1980 Monte Carlo, but it only had around 150-165 hp back then.

Heck, in the late 70's your best bet for domestic performance was buying something like a Pontiac Catalina, Buick LeSabre, or Olds Delta with the biggest possible engine, and ordering the towing package, which would give you a quicker gear ratio!"
292	July 20, 2004 9:15PM	driftracer	"According to one Camaro enthusiast:

http://www.nastyz28.com/camaro/camaro80.html

the Z-28 350 put out 190, but if you wanted a 4-speed car, you had to get the 165 hp 305...

The Mustang GT put out a whopping 157 hp...

http://www.mustanggt.org/82gt.htm"
293	July 20, 2004 11:05PM	andre1969	"I just looked it up in my old car encyclopedia, and the Z-28 in 1980 did indeed put out 190 hp, with the 350. Surprisingly HP on the 350 actually went UP a bit that year. In 1977, the first year Chevy went with no big blocks at all, it looks like the 350 had 170 hp, which I think was with a 4-bbl carb. In '78 it had 185 hp in the Z-28 and 170 in all other applications. For '79 it was 175 hp in all Camaros (standard on the Z-28) and 170 in everything else.

It also looks like they came out with a higher-output 305 in 1979, with 160 hp. Maybe that was with a 4-bbl carb? The base 305 was only 130 hp, maybe that was a 2-bbl? Anyway, at least it doesn't make me feel so bad about the 135 hp 318 that my '79 Newport had! ;-) I'm guessing that was an attempt to wean people off of the 350, which was dropped from everything but the Camaro and Corvette for '80. In the Corvette it put out 230 hp (optional) for '80, which is probably the highest output of any domestic engine that year."
294	July 20, 2004 11:13PM	driftracer	"and the highest output.

History from that time shows that if you wanted a 4-speed car, you had to settle for the 195 hp L48 - the higher output L82 only came with an automatic.

I remember a column from Car & Driver in 1979 after they tested the Indy Pace Car replica - Brock Yates commented that after driving a '67 big block, then driving the '79, it was like meeting your high school girlfriend, the homecoming queen, 20 years after high school, only finding out that she's now 350 pounds of jiggling double knit pants...."
295	July 21, 2004 2:25PM	kyfdx	"The cars from the late '70s weren't quite as slow as the horsepower numbers make them sound. I had a Cobra II that only had 135HP, but it was still a 302-V8 with gobs of torque. Pretty quick off the line, but redlined at 45MPH in second gear. Ran out of breath quick with only a 2-barrel. Not anywhere near muscle car fast, but would burn rubber all day (not that I did that at 18 years old).

regards,
kyfdx"
296	July 21, 2004 2:43PM	driftracer	with the same 302 a two-barrel. I smoked the tires on that car incessantly. Even more so when I swapped over to an Edelbrock SP2P (early emissions dual plane manifold) and a Holley 600 vacuum secondaries carb (electric choke, very streetable). I swear that change doubled the power of the car, and I guess that's not hard to do when you're starting at 135 hp...
297	July 21, 2004 2:48PM	kyfdx	There is one for sale sitting on a street near my house.. white with burgundy trim. vinyl roof and interior.. Looks almost perfect, with the original hubcaps.. I seriously doubt its a V-8, though.
298	July 21, 2004 2:50PM	andre1969	"was also about the lightest car in its class, starting as low as 2500-2600 lb for an unadorned 2-door. In contrast, the Chevy Malibu started around 3000 lb, and Novas and Volares were more like 3300-3400 lb, IIRC. One reason the Novas and Volares were chunky in base form was that they had inline 6es, which were much heavier than the Malibu's V-6. V-8 models were probably a bit more closely matched.

I'd imagine a Fairmont could be set up to be quite a little roadburner!"
299	July 21, 2004 2:53PM	andre1969	"but I think the last year you could get a 302 in a Fairmont was '79 or '80. Around 1980-81, they made that little 4.2/258 CID (?) V-8 the largest available engine, and I think for '83, the Fairmont's last year, the largest engine you could get was a 3.8 V-6.

Most Fairmonts I've seen have had the 200 CID inline 6. The Fairmont's heyday was really '78-79, as the Citation stole a lot of sales for 1980, and by '81, while still marketed as a ""compact"", it was viewed as still ""too big"" and archaic, compared to FWD offerings from GM and Chrysler."
300	July 21, 2004 2:55PM	kyfdx	"Except for the fact that its a piece of crap like every other late '70s Ford. I sold my Cobra II in '82 for only $1500 and with only 48K miles. It was already on its third clutch and the power steering box leaked, etc, etc.. The guy from the BHPH lot came and laid 15 Benjamins on my hood and I let him take it home. I think there was a reason the warranty was only 12 mos/12K miles.

kyfdx"
301	July 21, 2004 3:07PM	seminole_kev	"I remember a friend had an early 80's Ford LTD (was smaller than I think most LTD's had been if I remember right) that was actually a little swoopy (angular?) for the times that had a 302 in it. Had decent acceleration for the time.

Wasn't the LTD of that time based on the Fairmont? Seemed like that LTD was smaller than the big suckers that I remember."
302	July 21, 2004 3:36PM	andre1969	"the ""small"" LTD of '83-86 (all big LTDs were called LTD Crown Victoria starting in 1983) was based on the Ford Fairmont.

Initially the Fairmont was intended to compete with compact cars like the Chevy Nova and Plymouth Volare, but GM threw everyone for a loop in the late 70's with downsizing. First they did it to their big cars in '77, resulting in full-sized cars that were actually smaller on the outside and lighter than the typical 1977 intermediate (including GM's own) but were roomier inside.

Then for '78, GM launched the Malibu and other downsized intermediates, which were smaller and lighter than cars like the Nova and Volare, yet roomier inside. They ended up about the same size as a Fairmont, but heavier and a bit roomier inside.

Anyway, GM and Chrysler never really came out with ""true"" downsized intermediate platforms to compete with GM. Instead, they just guzzied up their compact platforms and called them intermediates. The Ford Granada and Dodge Diplomat/Chrysler LeBaron were originally considered ""luxury compacts"", but by around 1979 or 1980, they were trying to pass them off as intermediates.

In 1981, the Granada was moved to the Fairmont platform, and was passed off as an intermediate. Nevermind the fact that dimensionally, it was identical to a compact Fairmont. Well, for 1983, the Granada was re-skinned to look much more modern and less neoclassic/formal, and became the LTD. It was actually a good seller for Ford, although did nowhere near the same volume of GM's A-cars such as the Celebrity. I think it did outsell the Malibu in 1983 though, and was stronger in sales than Chrysler's RWD M-bodies or Chrysler's stretched out K-cars, which were called the E-body (Plymouth Caravelle, Chrysler E-class, now there's an imaginative name, Dodge 600).

Most of the '83-86 LTDs came with either a 2.3 4-cyl (I think it was the Brazillian OHC Pinto engine) or a 120 hp fuel injected 3.8. Some early models had a 200 CID inline 6, IIRC, or a carbureted 3.8 that put out around 105 hp. And there was a propane 4 option.

The 5.0 V-8 used in those LTD's was actually a special beast. It was supposedly only offered in '84-85, in a model called the LTD LX. It had 165 hp (in the T-bird/Cougar and full-sized cars, this engine only had around 140 hp, but the Mustang GT by that time was probably up to around 200-220), quicker gearing, and was supposed to be good for 0-60 in about 9 seconds. So it ended up being kind of an ""in between car"", not quite something like a Monte Carlo SS or Buick Regal T-type, but still a bit more than your everyday V-8 Bonneville, Cutlass Supreme, Monte Carlo, Diplomat, or Gran Fury.

Maybe the LTD LX could be looked at as an early attempt at a domestic ""sports sedan""?"
303	July 21, 2004 3:40PM	driftracer	was also available in a police package - in the summer of 1984, in Athens, Greece (Hellenikon AB), our Security Police unit got in five LTDs (the small ones) with an early 5.0 and a 4-barrel carb - the exhaust was dualed and had no cats to run on our leaded fuel. They flat screamed.
304	July 21, 2004 3:45PM	pontiacboi	"I certainly belong in chronic car buyers anonymous. I've been driving since '88, and here's what I've owned:

'81 Chevrolet Chevette
'86 Pontiac 6000
'90 Pontiac Grand Am
'92 Nissan Sentra
'92 Pontiac Grand Prix
'94 Mercury Cougar
'94 Nissan Altima
'87 Pontiac 6000
'97 Chevrolet Malibu
'97 Chevrolet Cavalier
'00 Pontiac Grand Am

So, in response to you, if you're a chronic car buyer, it makes sense to make that deal. I would do it just because I could, but only if you're not replacing one of your other cars in the near future. You probably wouldn't be able to hold onto the Accord for 10 years otherwise. I could only if I didn't drive it every day. The Accord will last you, and you won't get sick of looking at it if you're replacing one of your other cars in the near future."
305	July 21, 2004 3:49PM	andre1969	"in my police car book, to see how that LTD LX compared to the other police packages that year. I'm sure it was a screamer, especially compared to the likes of the Crown Vics, which never seemed to offer much in the way of performance as a police package, at least until they went aero for 1992 and got the 4.6 OHC engine.

Interestingly though, my 1985 new car guide from Consumer Guide tested a Crown Vic with a performance package that added $227 to the price of the car back then. It included traction-lok, dual exhaust, a quicker rear end (I want to say either 3.27 or 3.55, compared to the stock 2.73 or so), better tires and wider rims, and sway bars. That sounds like a great deal for $227, even way back then!

Anyway, in 0-60, Consumer Guide got it to do it in 10.5 seconds. In contrast, GM's V-8 cars, like a Parisienne 305 or a Delta 88 307, were only good for about 12. And honestly, not too many cars in that issue WERE able to break the 10 second barrier! I think one of the slowest was a Mercury Topaz, 0-60 in around 15.9! No wait, I think they had a V-6 Jeep Cherokee that was worse..."
306	July 21, 2004 3:52PM	driftracer	I'm sorry, but 20 cars in 15 years is a minimum to qualify - you only have 11, so you're almost normal. You can hang out, though - at least you're not one of those weirdos who have only owned 3 cars and keeps each one for 8-10 years!
307	July 21, 2004 3:54PM	driftracer	"compare the weight of the police package LTD LX 5.0 with the Mustang GT of the same year ('84-85)...interesting comparison - our police cruisers had a 3.55 rear gear, and the could dog my 1984 Supra or the V-8 Jag I built while stationed there.

This link brings back lots of memories - I'm suprised I wasn't caught in some of these photos - scroll down to 1978 and 1985:

308	July 21, 2004 5:56PM	scanty	"Drift, you are cutting me deep. Just because I've only bought three cars doesn't mean that I haven't wanted to change cars more frequently than J-Lo changes husbands. I originally leased the 300ZX for three years, thinking I would get a TT in '97, but Nissan decided to cancel it. How could I pass on buying the Z out of lease for $19,000?

I really want something new, but can't decide between the G35 Sport Coupe or the 350Z. Then again, I'm waiting to see what the '07 GT-R looks like. And a friend just got a S2000 that has piqued my interest. I'll probably show the 300 some love during the winter, get it looking shiny and new, and see if anyone wants to buy it next spring. My CCB addiction would be unleashed without the bird in the hand.

But I'm keeping the Pathy until it dies."
309	July 21, 2004 6:20PM	driftracer	"and a new member...I don't make the rules, in fact, no one does. I figure if you're always thinking about what you'll replace your current cars or cars with, you're hooked into Chronic Car Buyers disease.

Many people can buy something, live with it nearly forever, and lament when it goes away - I may love a car, but I'll always look forward to the next one. There are several I wish I'd never gotten rid of, as do many people, but I'd just have to add them to the stable now instead of replacing anything.

I bought the PT as a much-needed new car, knowing it would be temporary - that's a weird feeling, since I haven't put a lot into modifying the car like I normally do.

Now, the new truck and the Cobra, that's a different story..."
310	July 21, 2004 6:35PM	driftracer	"Last month, I got the itch again and looked at a WRX STi, then flipped over to getting my wife's truck early - the PT has a ding in the driver's rear quarter, and with the miles, the tradenumber looked horrible. I scratched the new car/new truck idea, sitting back, saving some money, gonna fix the PT, then sell it privately - that's still the plan.

The problem is, we need another car, so I started looking for a $1500-2000 car, like a Civic, Accord, Golf GTI - something with 2 doors and a 5-speed for me to drive. Looked at a few, then decided, again, to call off the search.

I kid at my son's work (Pep Boys) just bought a Dodge Raider in good shape, then talked about selling it - considering we get some winter here, I thought hard about it. I decided against it when the kid starting playing ""car salesman"" with me...

Final story, and I've already spent the money, is that I fronted my kid $2500 to get an engine swap in his 1990 Nissan 240 - we're doing a DOHC swap with an engine from a 1994 car, all the electronics, the better transmission, etc.

A buddy of mine, who owns a custom import shop, is doing the work and porting/polishing the head, port-matching the intake and header, rebuilding the engine with forged pistons and a Scat steel crank, etc - it'll be a real screamer when we take it out drifting.

Now that I've spent the money, I can stop looking for a month or two!!"
311	July 21, 2004 6:44PM	seminole_kev	glad you mentioned the Dodge Raider. I've always wanted to change out the grill to a Mercedes logo and see if I could sell it to someone as a Mercedes G-wagon. Seems like I could pull it off.....
312	July 21, 2004 7:08PM	driftracer	"in a 2-door model in Germany..

Think of how cool a well-done MB conversion could look on one of those..not radical, just really clean, with the big MB badge like you said."
313	July 21, 2004 7:13PM	seminole_kev	"oh I know, that's exactly why I'd love to do it. They always looked the same to me. Maybe pick up a Raider for $2,000 - get a custom Mercedes grill + change out some interior/exterior badging and see if I could sell it to so unsuspecting fool for maybe $30K as a well used G-wagon?

I guess I'm not that evil........maybe."
314	July 21, 2004 7:23PM	driftracer	"what happened, though!

More than anything, you'd be more welcome at the country club in that than in your Chevy..."
315	July 21, 2004 8:08PM	akangl	"Wow, its good to be in with my own kind. I admit it, I'm a CCB, I can't hide it anymore.

We are headed into town in a little while to hopefully buy a 2004 ZX3. How nutso is that?? Actually its not, we can pay the car off in 6 mos and keep the miles off the Titan. BTW, have had the Titan 5 1/2 weeks and its fixing to turn 7k miles. At that rate we will be at 50k on a 1 year old truck (150k on a 3 year old truck), can anybody calculate the depreciation on that?????

The ZX3 is a GREAT deal, MSRP $13,910, Price OTD is approx $10k. Can't buy a decent used car still under warranty for that.

Our problem is the Ram is a reg cab, so that leaves the Titan as our only vehicle.

Hubby says if he buys the ZX3 that I'm only allowed ONE tank of gas per month on the Titan. That's less than 400 miles!!!

Maybe having 2 vehicles to drive will keep my CCB at bay for a year or so."
316	July 21, 2004 8:18PM	seminole_kev	I have a Focus ZX5 and the misses has a ZTS sedan. Really like the hatchback. Fun to drive and practical.
317	July 21, 2004 8:19PM	akangl	We are looking at a base model, only option is ABS. Seems practical and not overboard. Although I'd rather have that SVT Contour, hubby says NO. *gasp* He actually told me NO.
318	July 21, 2004 8:26PM	seminole_kev	I seem to remember your screen name from around here in the past. Did you used to frequently post on a particular Edmunds topic awhile back?
319	July 21, 2004 8:34PM	akangl	Yeah, I'm a frequent poster, RWTV and a few other spots. I've been on edmunds for years.
320	July 21, 2004 8:40PM	seminole_kev	Just thinking back and I used to spend a good chunk of time on the Focus and Mazda Protege topics in Edmunds. Just was wondering if you spent a good amount of time there in the past. For whatever reason your screen name rung a bell.
321	July 21, 2004 9:03PM	anonymousposts	"""Just because I've only bought three cars doesn't mean that I haven't wanted to change cars more frequently than J-Lo changes husbands""

Even I'm not THAT bad!!

We are seriously DONE for now. I'm still trying to convince my husband that we should sell the 1994 Lexus LotsaSpiders 400. He says it's in storage and one day, just one day he is going to drive it again. Deep down I just think he would feel guilty for making that many spiders homeless.

akangl: If you are putting those kinds of miles on your Titan it makes sense to get a third vehicle. Depreciation is already steep enough on a new car but those kind of miles make it even worse. What about a base ext. cab Ford Ranger? You could still use it for trips to the local hardware store and with a 4 cylinder the gas mileage shouldn't be that bad."

323	July 21, 2004 9:18PM	michaellno	"I, too, have a Focus (ZX5, like seminole_kev), and if you can get 400 miles to a tank of gas, I'd be very surprised.

In the 8 months we've had our Focus, the most miles I've gotten in a single tank is something like 330-340.

But, I do agree that a cheap to own and economical vehicle makes sense given the number of miles you pile up. How about a 1 or 2 year old Corolla or Civic?"
324	July 21, 2004 9:21PM	anonymousposts	A 1-2 year old Civic would be way more than $10 OTD. Things can vary depending on where you live though so maybe that is not the case in some areas.
325	July 21, 2004 9:23PM	michaellno	"Possibly true -- I hadn't looked at any numbers, but was just throwing out some ideas.

The good news is that the Focus (still?) has the 5 year/100K warranty - at least, mine did when we got it last November.

Jolie, you looking at the '04 or the '05 model year Focus?"

331	July 22, 2004 3:31AM	akangl	"Picked up the 2004 Focus ZX3 this afternoon. That was the easiest car deal we've ever done.

Got there at 2:15, salesguy was MIA, located him 15 mins later. Drove the car, hubby said ""yup, this is the one"", I protested a little, but he put the old foot down and said ""NO, you CANNOT go to the Nissan dealer and look at the SVT"", I pouted, but he was right.

Did the deal up, sent it into finance, goofed around on the deck with the kids playing with radio control cars (belonged to the salesguy). Finance guy came out, we went back, signed everything, did our picture for the calendar, and left at 4:45.

Focus is a zippy fun little car, I'm surprised that I like it as much as I do. Hubby will take the Titan to drive back and forth to work (50 miles/month) and the Dodge will resume its position as strictly a business truck with the business paying its payment.

Its fun to drive a manual transmission. Topped the car off after coming through the hills (50 miles) and was right at 30 mpg. Should do pretty good me thinks. Lots better than packing 50k/year on the Titan."
332	July 22, 2004 7:46AM	andyman73	"Well, well, well... what do we have here. A wonderful gathering of souls suffering from the same illness. I have been floating around the forums for several weeks before I found this thread. Let me see, my car list..( in order of ownership)

86 Lincoln Town Car, signature series,
70 Mustang Grande(see foot note)
67 Mustang slant six swapped for 460
85 BMW 325e
88 CRX si
84 Datsun/Nissan 300Z turbo(automatic)
91 Civic DX hatchback
94 Civic EX coupe(plum purple/5 speed)Current driver

The Mustang Grand was ordered with the Boss 302 motor, from Canada. Paid 35 dollars to have the rust bucket haulled away. Sold motor for 3Gs, had GT-40 heads.

I learned to drive in a 78 Dodge Royal Sportsman van. Only had power assist brakes, no power steering or nothin', 'cept the go pedal. Had 318 and a 4 on the floor, and a posi rear end. Father ordered it brand new, picked up in Baltimore, June of 78, paid about 6,000, no radio either. Dad put his own in. Been all over, including a 3.5 year tour of duty in Augsburg, Germany during the late '80s. As far as Dodge quality, we got the only good one. It only took 19+ years to break anything. U-joint went,and that was that. Had over 300K on the clock. The motor was never touched, not even a single gasket, put bigger carb on it, and replaced clutches as needed. Did it himself. Only regret, not getting the 360. Big ol beast, not exactly quick, but not slow either. Had a nice 3 inch factory exhaust. My wife currently drives a 99 Ford Contour SE, with decent 2.5 V6. Looking to replace the Civic in 06 with the new Ford Freestyle wagon thingy, hopefully have the new 3.5 in it.

Just wanted to say some of you are totally sick wit it. And that's great!!! I am glad to have found you crazy bunch of car lovers.

336	July 22, 2004 1:59PM	tornado25	"Now I've got to start all over again, with a new date? Here I thought I was going out on a limb with an early January pick for akangl's next vehicle. Ok, let's see. The Focus is good for all the driving, but is it REALLY good enough to go on the day-long grocery shopping trip? I mean, how many groceries can you put in one, anyway? The Dodge is back in business and apparently, it's liked again, plus it's paid off in spring, so it's not going anywhere. The Titan, of course, is 100% beloved and miles are staying off, so THAT'S staying.

Hmmm....I'm saying April 6, 2005. After carting the kids around and trying to haul stuff in a ZX3 through an Alaskan winter, it'll be traded off for something that can go over road heaves, haul a week's worth of groceries and kids, plus get 25mpg.

(Ha! Just sort of kidding. It actually looks like, for once, you're exactly in the position you want to be, car-wise, akangl)."
337	July 22, 2004 2:08PM	driftracer	"Who can argue with that?!?

4 more, and she'll have one for each day of the week."
338	July 22, 2004 2:08PM	lemko	"...is a CCB. I've seen several vehicles parked in front of, behind, and alongside his house. These cars rotate positions. He has no visitors as he is regarded as something of a crank, so they can't belong to somebody else. They are all late model vehicles too. They are:

Chrysler Town and Country minivan
Ford Explorer
VW New Beetle
Honda Civic
Chevrolet Trailblazer (new).

Either he has a lot of disposable income or is up to his eyeballs in auto debt."
339	July 22, 2004 2:55PM	akangl	"I've got what I want, my toy (Titan) and my mizer (Focus). We went for the Focus ZX3 because that thing will haul so much. I was shocked at all the room, oh and the MOST important thing......our fishing cooler (huge) fits in the back with enough room for the fishing poles. That's all that matters. Its a 400 mile round trip to our fishing spot, now we can go twice a week instead of just once.

The Dodge is a good truck, only gets about 10k-12k put on it per year, less now that its strictly business. The Titan will go down to 10k-12k per year now and the Focus will pick up the other 30k or so per year.

It was kind of funny how we ended up with the Focus. Hubby and I were talking about buying a small car over coffee yesterday morning and started goofing around looking at rebates on cars. When I pulled up the Focus we were both amazed at the $3k rebate.

So he went outside to split wood, I started searching inventories. Found 3 cars in the state of Alaska that were close to what we wanted and only ONE had ABS which was important. Called the salesguy, told him we'd be there at 2 pm, by 5 pm we had the car. Was actually lots of fun, no stress.

Now I've really got to stay away from the car lots for a while."
340	July 22, 2004 4:14PM	isellhondas	Another month, another car for Jolie!
341	July 22, 2004 4:23PM	akangl	"We have been planning this for a while, was nothing new. Had been looking at $5k cars, but this was a much better deal for us.

At 7k miles in 5 weeks on the Titan we needed another personal vehicle, even with 2 vehicles in the yard, only one was for personal use (have to keep the IRS happy and account for the miles on the Dodge). We did have 3 vehicles until we dumped the Chevy again. Just remember, our business pays the payment on the Dodge.

So, what should I buy next month?? LOL"
342	July 22, 2004 4:26PM	scanty	"Akangl made an appointment for 2:00, actually showed up, and bought a car? You'll never make the ""Inconsiderate Buyers"" board with that type of behavior. You didn't even bobst the price around!

I'm going to pick August 31st for the next purchase. There's going to be too good a deal on whatever truck you were looking to trade the Dodge for.

Thanks for including those of us who only commit automotive adultery in our hearts in the CCBA support group."
343	July 22, 2004 4:39PM	akangl	"Darn right I showed up, always do. I told him I'd be there between 2 and 2:30, got there at 2:15, he was no where to be found. He came in a few minutes later, was out on a test drive, turned those customers and dealt with us. Didn't argue about the price at all either, I know there's only a $900 spread between invoice and MSRP on that Focus and $500 is eaten up in pack. Was a mini for the salesguy without me beating him to death. I paid what they wanted and left happy. They gotta keep the lights on too.

We aren't going to trade the Dodge, its only got 20k miles on it and is darn good at what it does. If anything was done with it we'd sell it privately, but I doubt that too since we want to pay it off and keep it. Contrary to popular belief, I really don't like car payments.

I need to quit this, its getting expensive, so will only dream from now on. (yeah right) Or maybe just buy radio control cars, yeah, that could be fun too."
344	July 22, 2004 5:30PM	boaz47	I know I am not one of you. I only buy when I am forced to. Thank goodness I am not like badtoy or nv. I have my habit under control. *S*
345	July 22, 2004 5:45PM	18fan	"I predict that Akangl will be sending that Focus packing as soon as the snow starts flying up there in the frozen tundra. I can just see it now... won't start in the cold... skids & slides like a skate.... heater doesn't work well enough.... almost landed in a ditch....

Will be looking at a Subaru with all wheel drive for the winter!

<;^)"
346	July 22, 2004 5:54PM	driftracer	"that Impreza Outback is a nice little car, and it's all-wheel drive...gets about the same mileage as a Focus...

December 15, 2004."
347	July 22, 2004 7:07PM	akangl	"I can't get winter tires for the Titan (unless I drop down a size) so it will sit this winter except for hubby driving it to work (50 miles/month).

I can, however, put bridgestone blizzaks on the Focus and it will handle the icy roads just fine (have done it before with FWD). If the Focus is anything like my Escort was it will handle winter just fine (Escort used to start at -25 with no trouble and not being plugged in) and the heater worked just fine.

I've had 2 Imprezas, nothing to write home about, gas mileage was low 20's in the summer and high teens in the winter. The 2000 2.5RS that I had was horrible in the snow, the 97 L wasn't too bad, but still nothing great.

You guys are killing me, I can't beat all these dates!!! I'm gonna run out of parking spaces in the driveway."
348	July 22, 2004 7:09PM	18fan	I think your choice of December 15th is way too generous. After all, doesn't the snow start flying in Alaska around Labor Day or so??
349	July 22, 2004 7:10PM	akangl	Usually around the first part of October, sometimes later.
350	July 22, 2004 7:14PM	driftracer	"her the benefit of the doubt of actually trying to stick it out for a couple of good snows before giving in to the car buying bug.

Did I say Impreza? I meant Jeep Wrangler...there's lots of snow tires available in a 235/75/15 size!"
351	July 22, 2004 7:38PM	akangl	"Oh gawd, I wouldn't be caught dead with a Wrangler, that is ONE vehicle I can honestly say I would NEVER own.

I think (ha, have thought before) that we have it figured out. We have the Ram as strictly a business truck (tax write off), the Titan as hubby's back and forth to work truck, my sometimes driver, our sometimes family vehicle, and the Focus as our do everything else car.

I'm gonna run out of parking spaces!! We have an 18' car hauler trailer and a pickup bed trailer, then the 3 vehicles in the yard, holy cow. Glad we live in the middle of no where."
352	July 22, 2004 9:17PM	nvbanker	Hey, wait a minute, boaz.....I can quit anytime I want to! In fact, I have quit hundreds of times! Usually right after I buy the car, I swear off new cars for weeks at a time!!! Don't lump me in with the rest of these addicts!!
353	July 22, 2004 11:35PM	stickguy	"what a minute, someone else used ""Bobst"" as a verb. Since I copyrighted it (having coined the term), that's another dollar for me.

Keep this up, and I can go car shopping again (hey, I have almost 500 miles on the last one I bought. Even have to get gas for the second time)."
354	July 22, 2004 11:39PM	akangl	"500 miles?? That's IT?? I'll be at that tomorrow on the Focus, has 200 on it right now. Going fishing tomorrow, that's another 400 miles.

The Titan has 6600 in 5 weeks, should go way down now, just hanging out looking pretty in the yard."

358	July 23, 2004 12:15AM	driftracer	"a friend of a coworker of my wife's called me tonight - we're drinking buddies, and I've helped her work on her car, and buy her last vehicle, a certified used Chevy Blazer LT 4x4.

She had a problem in that she was given a vehicle by a distant relative, put it in the shop for brakes all around and a radiator, and was going to give it to her youngest brother - it wasn't cool enough for him, so she offered it to me for the shop bill ($425).

I just bought a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer 4x4 (small one) 4-dr, red and black, grey interior, 87k miles, new brakes, new radiator, pretty danged sharp, no real scuffs or scratches...for $425...

I couldn't say no - I'm sorry. I was looking for another vehicle and was looking to pay between $2000-2500, but you can't gripe about saving that kind of money.

The thing looks great, was garaged, and I'll drive the wheels off of it until we order my wife's new truck, then I'll keep it around so my son doesn't have to drive his hopped up drift car on snow days."
359	July 23, 2004 12:19AM	akangl	"anonymousposts........ha, he's standing firm, you should have seen me pout yesterday. It wasn't about what *I* wanted it was about what *WE* needed, a small practical little car. I wanted so badly to go look at the SVT Contour, he said NO. I asked if we could go look at the Sentra, he said NO. He said ""our track record is we set out looking for one thing and end up buying something that's far more expensive, this car is perfect, its what we need and we aren't looking anymore, that's FINAL"" Try to argue with that, it don't work.

Isell.......the Dodge is religated back to the business truck, it can do whatever it wants. Its under its ESC for another 15k (about 15 months now that its being driven for business only). I don't drive it and I don't deal with it.

As for the Focus being too small, its small, but we can fit our fishing cooler in there and with a little manuveuring we can fit the fishing poles and tackle box. That's all that matters. Plus I can easily fit 2 weeks worth of groceries in it, its easier to get groceries with the Focus then it is the Titan, believe me."

364	July 23, 2004 12:24AM	akangl	Considering our credit isn't perfect and we have good history with Ford Credit we tend to stick with them. GMAC approved us on a 2004 Mazda Tribute LX for 60 mos at 20.9% APR back in January. Even our salesman thought that was outrageous considering Ford hit us at half that. Plus I don't think the Mazda 3 could have been had for $11k brand new.
365	July 23, 2004 12:24AM	anonymousposts	That might be the best deal I have seen on Edmunds. You sure there isn't a dead body in the trunk?
366	July 23, 2004 12:25AM	anonymousposts	"I thought Mazda Credit was a subsidiary of Ford Credit. I could be wrong though.

You are right about the 3 not being $11,000, especially the hatch. The sedan can be had for around $12,000 if I am not mistaken though."
367	July 23, 2004 12:27AM	akangl	Mazda didn't like us then, don't know why, we never did anything to them. The ford finance guy at the dealership said that our credit was actually pretty darn good considering. Hubby was a 650 beacon, tier 1.
368	July 23, 2004 12:55AM	andyman73	"Maybe we all will get lucky, and they will build a new derivative of the 323 GTX. Now I would definitly check that out. A little CCB side note, last year I convinced a female coworker to trade in her '97 Eclipse GST for something better. She is now finishing learning to drive stick in an '04 Evo. She has upgraded the shoes to a more userfriendly hi po allweather tread. And has undercar and incar neons, is shopping intakes and exhuasts. She absolutely loves it. Oh by the way, I put the first dent in it too. I paid for it, tho'. Sometimes her 60 year old dad takes it to work. He loves it too.

I hear they are talking about upgrading the 3 liter because of the upcoming shared Ford offerings. We are witnessing the revival of the muscle car movement. Just look how Nissan has gone, and now everyone is playing catch up. We can, to a point, have our cake and eat it too.

I can't say I'm exactly fond of the thing in general, but it has been reliable, if nothing else. Wow, $425, you flat stole it!!

373	July 23, 2004 2:28PM	michaellno	"Yesterday, some friends of ours traded in their 2 month old Hyundai Elantra GT for a Santa Fe (V6 AWD).

The wife called me this morning on her way to work and wants to go to the Saturn dealer tonight to consider trading in our '03 L300 V6 for a VUE AWD V6.

The L300 was bought 20 months ago and now has just over 30K on the clock. The original plan was for me to keep it 7-8 years.

Yeah, right!

Of course, the VUE would be the wife's daily driver and I would continue to drive the Focus -- at least, until my daughter is ready to have the responsibility of a car full-time (ie, she pays the insurance and has to get a job).

At that point (probably next spring) we will need to decide what to do -- allow daughter to drive the Focus (which is why we bought it in the first place) and get something for me

...or...

I continue to drive the Focus and the daughter gets a new Ion.

Decisions, decisions....

(note: this is not a plea for help or intervention, just needed to get this off my chest)

My name is Michael, and I've been reading Car and Driver since 1976 (when I was 13)."

379	July 23, 2004 4:06PM	michaellno	"may not be the right forum, but here goes....

how do you CCB'ers deal with the depreciation issue (specifically, Jolie and anon).

The used car manager called me - I had submitted some info over the net on my L300 to get the ball rolling.

They pegged my trade in at $11,500, which puts me massively upside down. Now, the fact that I would be trading it in for another Saturn has got to help me somewhat - let's face it, they want to turn over a new car sale.

Do y'all just have loads of cash lying around that you can use to absorb some of the hit?

Will keep everyone posted -- am supposed to hear from the sales manager from the Saturn store later to talk more details."

381	July 23, 2004 4:24PM	akangl	"My 97 Explorer for the 2004 we were even in it, not upside down at all (thanks to the paid off truck we traded in on the 97 Explorer). When we went to trade the 2004 Explorer on the 2004 Titan we were buried, so broke out the backhoe and started digging. We had a paid off truck that we were dying to get rid of, dealer offered $3k for it, Titans had a $1k rebate and we put $1k down. That took care of most of the neg, didn't have to over finance the Titan by trading the Chevy.

The Focus we had no trade, the Dodge we are married to for a long time (least until its paid for). Would need about $5k to get out of it, so we figure we'll just keep it.

I don't like trading when we are upside down, it bothers me. I think we will be keeping what we have for a while. I don't want to dig out of another one for at least a while.

I sat down and figured out that I'll be pretty close to even in the Titan at the 3 year mark on the loan, so will trade it then. Should only have 40k or so on it, warranty will be up and we'll move up to a 3/4 ton diesel.

The Focus will take the brunt of the miles, so will pay it off quickly and drive it until it dies. The Dodge being business only will probably stay a while, its only driven 12k/year.

I'm really trying to slow the CCB, maybe now that I have 2 vehicles to drive it will hold me over for a while. I'd like to keep the Titan for 3 years, its a good truck."

386	July 23, 2004 6:20PM	anonymousposts	"We have been lucky to get pretty good deals on our cars coupled with low interest rates which keeps us from being too buried in a new car. Then we can always find a clunker, fix it up, and make money so it evens out.

A lot of people think their old Accords, their old Lexi, and their old Civics are worn out at the 100,000 mile mark and will sell them for cheap. Clean them up nicely and a local college kid or someone who needs a second car will jump on a car if the price is right, it looks good, and runs strong.

Examples:
We bought a 91 Integra with 134,000 miles for $2500. It had a muffler that was falling off, needed a timing belt, had 3 different sizes/brands of tires on it, and looked like it had never had a bath in it's life. We put new tires on it, a new timing belt, a new muffler and drove it til 165,000 miles. Sold it to a co-worker for $3750.

We bought a 92 Integra with 120,000 miles on it for $2700. Needed new tires and a windshield. Gave it new tires and a windshield and had a neighbor begging to buy it for $5000.

Bought a 1995 GS300 with 135k for $5500. The car was filthy and needed new tires. Spent a day steam cleaning, washing, and vacuuming. Car looked like new afterwards. Drove it until 148,000 miles and sold it for $6800.

We have lost money before but due to other circumstances we have made it up. We had a 2000 Silverado, bought new, that was a piece of junk. MSRP was $25000 and a year later with only 7,000 miles trade value was $16,500 which left us $5000 in the hole. We bought a pristine 1994 LS400 with 113,000 miles for $10,000. We still have it 3 1/2 years later and could still get around $8,000-$9,500 if we sold it privately.

We also bought a 2001 Protege new and after our first road trip in it we discovered that it was definitely NOT meant for highway driving. So we found a 2000 Civic Si that we were able to get for $10,000. Drove the Civic for 6 months and then were able to get $12,200 in trade for it towards a 2002 Civic Si at $1500 below invoice. What negative was left from the Protege was wiped out when some woman turned out in front of me and totalled my Si less than 1 month after I bought it. Her insurance company paid the car off and we still had a few dollars to spare.

So some of it has been pure luck and some of it has been our ability to see a diamond in the rough."
387	July 23, 2004 6:56PM	nvbanker	"Yes, it's contagious - whenever someone I know gets a new car, and I smell it, and drive it, I get the almost uncontrollable bug for a new car myself.

No, we CCBers don't always have tons of cash lying around, some of us are up to our eyeballs in debt. But, most people have some vice - ours seems to be cars.

It's much better as a CCBA member to buy used. YOu take a lot less of a hit on the depreciation, and can satisfy your new car jones much cheaper. If you work it really well, and buy the cars right, you could actually even make money!! However, sadly, most of us aren't that focused, and tend to just impulse buy as often as possible, and therefore, keep the economy strong with our senseless purchases..... But, we're happy!"
388	July 23, 2004 9:50PM	michaellno	"yeah, if I gave in to CCB as often as I wanted, I'd be broke.

However, I do agree with you that you could stay even if you bought the right cars .. yeah, boring ones like Accords and Camrys.

(note: I'm not knocking either the Accord or the Camry -- I've had two Accords and my folks owned a Camry for many years -- it's just that they are not meant to be exciting.)

Even though those cars hold their value real well, I think the biggest issue with having CCB is buying fun to drive cars -- that depreciate like a rock thrown from the rim of the Grand Canyon. What really sucks is to have a boring car that depreciates that fast -- like my Saturn. Then you have the worst of both worlds.

Still working with the new car manager at the Saturn dealer to see if we can get out of the L300 and into a VUE."

391	July 24, 2004 6:21AM	boaz47	"First remember if you look at some of the cars they weren't brand new when they were bought. Till I got my first Honda Si I can't remember taking a beating on a trade. If you buy a good used car that only need cosmetics and you fix it up and drive it a year or two you can often get your money back out of it. The SI was too easy to damage because the front clip tended to be a weak point if you raced them. One good smack into a hay bale and the Little SI was front end toast. Therefore when I traded it I took my first real loss. Not bad considering all the fun I had and what my son had done to the car but we didn't break even. Plus even the worst of the CCBs may have a favorite new car that they just have to keep toying with. Much like the Winchester Mansion if you do a little at a time you can effectively keep it a lot longer. One year a intake and exhaust. Next year a lowering kit and body kit. Next year some engine work. Then some bigger rims and low profile ultra high performance tires. Yes you may get another vehicle and even sell it while you work on your project but it doesn't have to be new just different. When I had my Camaro and was working on it I had two rather stock Suzuki Samari and a Mazda 626 that I did very little to. After I sold the Camaro I got another Suzuki and turned it into a rock crawler that would surprise a Jeep club. First gear low range was so low you could tie off the wheel and get out and walk faster than the car would go. Secondary cars don't have to cost that much nor do you concern yourself with trading them. And when you sell a project car you aren't trading for the most part. Somebody wants it and is willing to pay for it.

subtone.

Just as a word of caution. German cars can be expensive to fix after warrentee. I am not saying the Audi is a bad car but if you are into wrenching I would suggest you look into the cost of upkeep of an older German car. Not a slam nor am I dissing German cars. But ask others about repair and upkeep costs."

I'm one of your friends who has seen that picture and I groaned too!"
396	July 24, 2004 7:26PM	andre1969	"I went up to Northern MD with one car, and I came back home with one car...and yes, it was the SAME car! ;-)

Sadly, this Cordoba needed more work than I'd feel comfortable taking on. Actually, I had myself talked out of it pretty quickly, until he fired it up. The 318 V-8 is out of a '75 or so Dart, which isn't exactly the finest hour of the 318 (although they'd get worse), but it was rebuilt, and had (IIRC) a Holley 600 cfm 4-bbl carb on it. Sounded VERY sweet!

But alas, there ws just too much rust. The quarter panels on both sides were rusted. As with most Mopars of the mid-late 70's, this one had a wide gap on either side where the trunk floor stopped, and then dropped down into a well between the trunk and the quarter panel. Just perfect for accumulating dirt, junk, moisture, rust, holes, etc. It was also rusting on both sides of the rear quarters, at the bottom, underneath the rear side windows. And the lower back bottoms of the front fenders were rusting. Both plastic end caps were busted, although he had fiberglass reproduction pieces.

Inside, the headliner was just starting to let go, and the dash pad was cracked, discolored, and a bit moldy. Otherwise though, the interior wasn't too bad. About as loose and rattly as it probably was when it left the showroom floor in 1980!

Underneath, there was a rear metal valance panel (I guess that's what you'd call it) behind the gas tank, and ahead of the bumper. It connected the inner parts the rear quarter panel, and also connected to the back part of the trunk well. It was pretty much shot as far as rust goes. Didn't look like as major of a structural part as, say, one of the sub-frames, or the front cowl, but still something that would weaken the car a bit, and only get worse as time went by.

Now I'll admit, this still wasn't an easy decision to make, even though the body was pretty bad. It's one of those things where, if I'd seen it maybe 5-10 years ago, and didn't have so many lawn ornaments already sitting around, I would've probably jumped on it. I don't think it's anything I'd ever want to do a full restoration on, as I could probably go out and find the nicest 1980 Cordoba in the world for what? Maybe $5,000? If that? But it's something that, in another time, I would've bondoed up the holes, put a fairly cheap paint job on it, cleaned it up some, and drove it around until something catastrophic broke on it!

It was a real pretty car in its day, though. This guy had pics of it from when it was younger...he'd had it about 10 or 11 years. All red body with a red/white vinyl interior...very sharp!

This guy had a ton of extra parts too. Extra driver's door, extra decklid, the plastic strips that run along the tops of the doors on the inside and usually break right around where the lock button is. Surprisingly, thhe piece on the driver's side was still virgin. The passenger side was broken though. Somehow, he'd found these NOS parts for it though, and 6 months after he replaced the one on the passenger side, the new one broke! Lessee, what else? Extra suspension parts, a front-end rebuild kit, and a whole back-end of a 1989 Ram Charger full of extra interior and engine parts!

Okay, lemme stop now before I talk myself back into it!!"

I keep trying to tell myself: just 4 months of payments to go on the Intrepid and I'm car payment-free! But when I see a 300 in Magnesium, which is the color I want, if I get one, all that logic goes out the window.
401	July 25, 2004 1:36AM	nvbanker	Are ya checking the 300C problems board? It's a little scary...you may wanna wait until they shake down the bugs in this unit. Maybe until the Intrepid is paid off???? But you usually buy them used anyway, don't you (like a smart man would)? I've been watching the board closely, for the same reasons, I'm interested in this bad boy, but don't want to pick up a first year with tons of gremlins. Of course, I'm a moron, and lease my cars, so I'll shoot for an 05 probably.

403	July 25, 2004 1:47AM	andre1969	"no, I haven't checked the 300 problems board yet, but on allpar.com, I caught whiff of a jab along the lines of ""The Hemi is being a lot less troubleprone than the Benz 5-speed""!

And yeah, I've bought or received most of my cars (very) used! The Intrepid is the only car I ever bought brand-new. And honestly, looking back, if I'd known how fast they depreciate, I probably would've picked up a 1-2 year old used one! But that's water under the bridge now, and if nothing else, there's the consolation that I know how this car was treated from day one!

But yeah, in the end I think I'm just too rational, or cheap, or whatever you want to call it, to justify the $500+ a month car payment that a 300C would probably run me. And even if I had the cash to pay for it in full, for instance, when I finally get my condo sold, I just wouldn't feel right putting $30,000 or so all at once into something I know is going to depreciate. I'd rather take my chances on the stock market!"
404	July 25, 2004 3:30AM	nvbanker	Yeah, I paid $33,000 cash for my 92 Continental, and regretted it for years - started leasing after that and left my cash in the market. Passive income actually outran depreciation on some of my leased cars! Not a bad idea. Anyway, I'm all for the 300C, and except for a rough idle, the Hemi pleases people. The cars generally pull to the right though, and have some other annoying, universal problems too. Eventually though, being a CCB, you're gonna have one, and you know it right now, don't you?

409	July 25, 2004 12:20PM	driftracer	"I think the ""pulling to the right"" is the most common problem I see in lemon law cases - I think that's because consumers expect to let go of the wheel and have the car go straight down the road, which is impossible. Roads are built with a crown for two reasons: first, water runs off, not staying in the road to cause a dangerous situation for drivers, and second, if you fall asleep at the wheel, your car will pull towards the shoulder instead of into oncoming traffic.

Cars SHOULD pull to the right, but between uninformed consumers, and technicians/service advisors who can't give a logical explanataion, there is a perceived problem which, for the most part, doesn't exist."

413	July 25, 2004 1:45PM	driftracer	"About 3 out of 4 cars, it seems, gets that ""pulls to the right"" complaint within the first few thousand miles. I see a bunch of these complaints, so I'm not about to judge the 300 in an ""ominous"" manner."
414	July 25, 2004 2:58PM	nvbanker	"I totally understand what you're saying driftracer - but how do we account for the fact that no other car on a problems board is complained about for pulling to the right, or left, or anywhere else - just the 300C? Furthermore, there is ""drifting to the right"" on a crowned road, which is what usually happens to any car when you let the wheel go on a crowned surface. Then, there's the ""pull"" that constantly requires wheel attention because the wheel wants to go to the right constantly. Freeways are not usually crowned noticeably, they're banked. If your car pulls noticeably on the freeway, it has a problem. None of my cars will pull on a freeway assuming no wind. So, people complaining about the 300C pulling excessively must have something going on. The roads are the same roads they drove in their old car, and evidently, the cars people sold or traded for the 300C, didn't have the problem so noticeably. Plus, Chrysler has issued a TSB on the problem. Evidence would suggest, this car has an aggravated issue with pulling. At the very least, the steering is so markedly different than other cars, it seems hypersensitive to the many drivers."
415	July 25, 2004 3:27PM	isellhondas	"The road in front of our dealership is a fairly steep grade with a heavy crown.

Quite often, especially on used cars, the first thing a shopper will do is take their hands off the wheel.

"" IT PULLS TO THE RIGHT"" I'll hear.

Ah...it's actually drifting to the right a bit as all cars should do.

Then I'll have to find a road with less of a crown and they'll try it again.

Big difference between a slight normal drift and a ""pull""!"

My family on both sides were in the Automotive business. I myself have been in the business close to 30 years. As a 4 year old I could identify every car on the road.
Since I have been old enough to buy cars in the early 1970's I have purchased over 50 vehicles. I started out buying basic transportation, and it evolved from there. I have done the Van thing, the Truck thing, the Sports Car thing, the SUV thing, the Collector thing, the Luxury thing, and back to the sedan thing. I enjoy the hunt, the research, the negotiation etc. After bringing the new car home I have this feeling of what do I do know? I plan for my next car! I have tried to grow up and put this into perspective, but there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about buying the latest new car, truck, or suv. Came close a couple times this year.

Of course there's the honeymoon period where you keep running back to the window or down to the garage to peek at it and everyone is looking at your nice shiny new car. Then reality sets in, the car gets dirty, needs gas, and some loser puts a ding in your door. Suddenly you start seeing other people with shinier, newer cars and it makes you reminisce about when you had a nice shiny, new car. So instead of doing the obvious and getting our cars washed and waxed we CCBs go out and buy another car that we just know will be THE ONE that we keep forever. Then it gets dirty, needs gas, and that door ding is just hideous ....

Kinda weird to even think about, we started this business 5 years ago. He's giving it until November, but things don't look hopeful.

433	July 26, 2004 5:12PM	tornado25	"""Ok, fine guys - I'm just saying, 50% of the complaints on the 300C board are related to pulling to the right""

Yes, but what does that mean, really? 50% of how many complaints overall? Don't know? So we get ""Gee, most of the complaints are for one problem, the car is junk""? What about this example: A car, pick a car has 100 complaints per 1000 cars, but the most any ONE problem appears is 10 out of that 100. Let's say the 300C has 80 complaints (both numbers totally made up) but the right pull is 40 of those 80 (as you said ""50% of the problems are related to pulling to the right""). What does that tell us? Nothing, except to my eye, the 300 is more reliable.

I'm not a stats major, but I know enough that if you throw out a number like ""50% of all complaints are x""--without telling me how many complaints there are overall OR what the average number of complaints are for other comparable vehicles, then that ""50%"" stat is absolutely useless.

To the point, Chrysler has recognized this as a problem (whether it's real or phantom) and provided a camber kit for dealers to install when customer complains. Several owners of 300s have stated on the main 300 board that yes, they experienced the problem, had the kit installed and now the problem is gone. It would have been nice for you to have mentioned that.

Don't like the 300C? That's cool. Drive what you like and you're entitled to your opinion that the 300 is unreliable. But, to make it sound like this quite possibly the most unreliable vehicle ever produced in its first year (words like ""ominous"") is unfair."

If you'll nose around a bit, tornado, you'll note that I like the 300C, which is why I'm following it. I'm considering it as a new sedan in my fleet. I'm the guy who started the ""Chrysler Turnaround"" topic here. I'm just very concerned about the unusual number of posts of problems on the board, and a very high number of them related to one issue. And it will likely put me off at least a year, to see if they get it corrected. If they don't, it will move me in another direction. That's what I use Edmunds for - research.

Here's a recent exerpt from the 300C board - take issue with him, why don't ya?

""#114 of 121 issue: pull to the right, MAJOR CAR DEFECT by jeqq Jul 26, 2004 (1:00 am)
I test drove two 300c's so far.

The second one initially had a immediate and rather severe pull to the right . However, it had no pull for the remainder of a 30 minute test drive. I am positive, and I repeat positive, it was not due to road crown.

I must say something that many of you may not like to hear. Even if this pull to the right is sometimes attributed to road crown,(and again I am sure that was not the case with me) there is a major problem with this car. No car should ever handle like that if road crown exists. I could have had a car accident, had I not been a good driver and concentrating on the road at that particular moment. I could see someone possibly having an accident if in that time frame they were not on top of their driving. All it would take would be one momentary lapse in concentration or your hand momentarily off the wheel and the car goes off the road, or maybe something worse. We all have had these moments. I would not trust this car, it could have a horribly deadly outcome.

Has anyone else experienced this severe momentary pull to the right?

P.S.

There is a post somewhere in the forums about a car accident attributed to this problem. I think 300c owners should start a class action lawsuit and have Chrysler recall and fix this steering problem immediately. Please do not wait until more cars are out there on the road.""

I'm very surprised y'all jumped all over me for mentioning this matter - I was recounting what I have read here only. Didn't realize we had some rabid Chrysler defenders here who can't handle a little concern over a new model. You'd think I have insulted the holy Honda or something."

I remember the ""post somewhere"". If you nose around a bit in the main 300 board, you'll note that I (and several other posts) roundly criticized that post. The person was leaning over or down to check the e-brake (because the light came on), the car veered and the driver crashed into a pole. I'm sorry, but THAT story was absolutely ridiculous--the rantings of someone who simply couldn't admit they screwed up while driving.

To be fair, I haven't driven a 300. I can't say whether that drift is there or not, or how severe it is, or if it's normal due to crowning. My main point, in my prior post, was missed entirely. There are NO reliable statistics that can be discerned from this message board. And looking at statistics--not what percentage of all problems reported are this problem or not what percentage of posts here report problems--RATHER--what percentage of ALL owners of this car have a problem or what percentage of ALL owners have drift?--is the only effective way to know how reliable this car is. Posts on the board are only anecdotal evidence of people seeking a way to complain.

It's always worth repeating. In very few boards do the majority of the posters come on simply to say how great and problem-free the car is and then go away. Many regular posters will hang out because they are enthusiasts, but I would say most people who come on briefly do so to simply complain. ""This is wrong, that is wrong, how do I fix it, do you have the problem."" Posters on a message board are NOT a fair or representative sample of all 300 owners, so it's IMPOSSIBLE to correctly draw any conclusions about the car's reliability from a message board.

Again, it's also worth noting that Chrysler came out with a fix for the problem and at least a couple posters who previously indicated they had the problem stated the car was perfectly fine after the camber kit was installed.

If you find the 300 interesting and find it might be something you'd like to buy, then I suggest you DRIVE one and see for yourself if it drifts or has problems."

445	July 27, 2004 12:31PM	andre1969	"as I'm a fan of the car too, and want one some day, but one thing I've noticed is that there seem to be plenty of them where the front fascia lines up very poorly with the hood. Almost like it's tilted a bit, lining up as it should on the driver's side, but then sloping off a bit on the passenger side, enough so that you can see a widening gap where the hood meets. Has anybody else noticed this?

It's not a big deal, as I've seen (and owned) plenty of cars with much bigger fit and finish problems than this, although I've never owned one where the front fascia (called the header panel on older cars, I think) lined up so poorly! To me it's just annoying though, since one goal of these cars was to improve upon the build quality/fit and finish of the cars they're replacing!"

Our office lead has a 300 with the 3.5 V-6. I think it's the Touring edition. He says it has more than enough power for him...and this guy once owned a 300M! One of my co-workers has a 300C, and positively loves it. Before the C he was driving a Dodge Ram pickup, so he has nothing but praise for the C's power and economy! His father was a former Chrysler bigwig, so their family gets their cars ""at cost"", whatever that means...he's always been kinda vague about just how good of a deal he gets. I think his mother got a 300 as well, but I'm not sure which model."
448	July 27, 2004 1:30PM	lemko	"...the 2.7 V-6 isn't as bad as I thought it would be. It moves the car with enough authority for everyday driving, but I wouldn't race people at stoplights. I don't know how it compares to the 3.1 in her 1999 Oldsmobile Cutlass or the 3.4 in the 2001 Impala. I'd have to see the specs side by side if anybody has them.

I was telling a co-worker about the car this morning. He refers to the 300 as a ""Bentley for poor people."" Indeed the car's styling does remind me a bit of the Bentley."
449	July 27, 2004 1:39PM	andre1969	"the last time I saw specs, the 300 with the 2.7 was supposed to do 0-60 in about 10.5 seconds. In contrast, in the older LH, I've seen times anywhere from 9.0-10.2 seconds for the ""regular"" 2.7, and around 8.8 seconds for the 2.7 that had the variable intake, which was standard on the earlier Intrepid ES models (finally replaced around 2001 or 2002, along with the 3.2, with a de-tuned 3.5).

In contrast, I think I've heard 0-60 in around 8.8-9 seconds for an Impala 3.4. And I'm not sure about the '99 Malibu/Cutlass, which had a 155 hp 3.1, but the '00+ models, which had a 170 hp 3.1, I think could do 0-60 in about 9 seconds as well.

On the older LH cars, one thing that really held back the engines was the transmission. They upshifted too soon, so you couldn't get the full effect of the lower gears. Although I did find that if I held my 2.7 to around 5,000 rpm, which is about where peak torque is, instead of just punching it all the way, it would hold the gears longer and take off a bit quicker. I dunno how the newer cars act, though. I know the 2.7 has been retuned and actually lost 10 hp in the process, down to 190 now. And torque is the same, at 190 ft-lb, but it's supposed to be a much broader curve than it was in cars like my '00 Intrepid."
450	July 27, 2004 3:21PM	gee35coupe	I haven't been to the dealer to check em out yet. But Chrysler has done it again styling-wise. Now lets see how it hold up over time. I've even been seing Vipers with clouded-over headlights lately. Youd think they would have higher quality lighting on the halo car. With the huge front end of the 300, I hope the chrome trim and paint holds up over time.
451	July 27, 2004 3:28PM	andre1969	"how the front-end of the 300 is going to hold up in a mild front-end whack with another car! It just looks like it's begging to be broken, with a huge repair bill to go along with it.

As for clouded-over headlights, I noticed about a month ago that my '00 Intrepid is just starting to get that problem. Looks like it's on the inside of the lights, too. Figures, just as I get to the point that it's just about paid for!"
452	July 27, 2004 3:34PM	andre1969	"I went to the autobytel website to see if they had any used 300's listed yet. Only found one within 500 miles of my zipcode (actually it's only 38 miles away), a midnite blue C with 1200 miles, for $38,000!

In contrast, I found 3 GTOs listed already, within 500 miles. All of 'em around the $30-31K range."
453	July 27, 2004 4:02PM	seminole_kev	are those headlights sealed or can you remove them and get the the back side of them? If so, I've heard that Brasso can clear up the yellow/cloudy problem.
454	July 27, 2004 4:07PM	andre1969	"I've never had to replace a bulb, but I'm guessing they're just the normal type of composite headlight where the bulbs screw into the back? The deterioration actually looks like there's a thin layer of something that's burning off, kinda like how those clearcoat paints did back in the late 80's/early 90's.

I don't think it's an assembly that you can actually take apart though, so the only way to get inside them, I'm guessing, would be the holes where the bulbs go into?"
455	July 27, 2004 5:55PM	lemko	"...that toothpaste will clear yellow or cloudy lenses. Fortunately, I haven't had this problem. Headlight assemblies for the Cadillac Seville are very expensive - $385 each via the bodyshop. They're probably a lot more for the poor slob who just goes to the dealer's parts counter.

I miss the days of $7.00 sealed beam bulbs at your local discount mart!"
456	July 27, 2004 6:03PM	andre1969	"my buddy bought a new headlight assembly for his '95 Grand Marquis. The passenger-side had not only yellowed out, but had cracked along the bottom. He bought a new one from the dealer for about $230.00. Between the two of us, we couldn't figure out how to get it on, so he ended up paying another $65-70 or so to have a repair shop put it on. So basically, that headlight job cost about $300!

Now to be fair, that headlight cluster was fully self-contained, and housed the low-beam, high beam, and turn signal/side marker light, not to mention all the little trim, backing, etc. If you were to go and buy all that for an older car...not just the bulbs but also the lenses, trim, all the junk it mounts to, etc, you wouldn't be looking at a cheap replacement either. So in an accident where all that stuff got smashed, it would probably be about the same, either way. But if you just got a headlight broken out, like from a rock, then you're talking $200+ versus $7-8.

And to make it worse, since most cars nowadays have unique headlights, it's not like you can just go to the junkyard and easily find a used part. And because of the contouring, the left side is going to be different from the right side, as well."

466	July 28, 2004 9:33PM	akangl	Kenai is BEAUTIFUL, we are looking at buying property down there, but its spendy. Anchorage is very expensive, Wasilla isn't too horrible but is getting up there with Anchorage.

473	July 28, 2004 10:29PM	anonymousposts	This time around I told my husband that we should buy a used Volvo but after looking for all of 1 day he became convinced that an acceptable one couldn't be found and decided he wanted another Accord. I did help by giving him the numbers to negotiate with though so I am not entirely without blame.
474	July 28, 2004 10:33PM	akangl	Mine is pretty savvy when it comes to numbers, he knows where to look and what to pay. Normally though I go pick out the car and he just signs, this time he knew what he was after and was on a mission. His mission was NOT going to be scuttled by a whiny wife who wanted a sports sedan.

476	July 28, 2004 10:59PM	akangl	Sounds about the same with mine. He's on a new mission though, so I kinda doubt I'll be getting a new car anytime soon. He wants (and so do I) a travel trailer and a boat. Even if it means selling the Dodge and driving the Titan for 2-3 years.

Only Saab I've ever owned was given to me........after it blew the engine.

Oh no, it's not like that. You are Code Orange, a High Risk of Car Purchase. A team will arrive at your location to prevent this purchase. Duct tape and plastic sheeting will be used, if necessary. Once the team has determined the threat has passed, you will be at Code Yellow, an elevated risk of car purchase.

akangl, OTOH, well, she's at Code Orange all the time. However, there's a team stationed nearby for the near weekly Code Red.

I have checked with a used car lot about consigning the Dodge for us and they were VERY interested when they found out it only has 20k miles on it. Will find out tomorrow what's going to happen with our business.......my vote is for jumping ship, but hubby wants to hang on until the last moment.

Right now all I can think about is getting the car paid off, that's a HUGE goal."

She can afford it, so didn't mind my encouragement, and she was looking for a sporty AWD to drive. Then, she had to learn to drive stick in that thing. What a blast to drive! Very stable at 120mph in the rain, I can attest to that! She loves it so much, but her 60 year old dad takes it to work just as much! He loves it too! Maybe I'd be a bad influence for anonymous. I had tried to convince my wife to get a 2000 SVT Contour, but she didn't want to learn to shift for herself, so settled on a 99 SE V6, not a slouch, either. A new purchase, the SVT would have been about 1G cheaper. Dad-in-law is a retired Ford emp. so has discount purchase plan. Still has under 40k miles. I keep telling my wife, that if my ship ever does come it, we'll need a nice pole barn to park all my cars in. Some how the only ship to come my way has been a rowboat. ;>)

It's already starting ... a few days ago it was ""drive the Focus til it croaks"" Now we are already hearing about the next car

I do't think it's the car mags feeding the addiction. I think you have to already have the addiction to subscribe to all those car mags in the first place.

I do agree that car magazines are like sports announcers in that they make the game seem more interesting than it is.

We already have 1500 miles on it in just a week from going fishing.

Hubby is supposed to be having a little *sit down* with the logging guy and see what happens, but it sounds like the Dodge will be sold soon. I told hubby that we aren't buying anything else until the Focus is paid off."
498	July 30, 2004 5:50PM	gee35coupe	That suzbamitsu sounds a lot like my SI. It rides like a roller skate with the roll bar and springs but still gets great gas mileage and is dependable as the sun. It's just that I'm pushing 35 and my LS400 seems too old while the SI is too young. That's why I wanted that Viggen. It seems just right. It was cheap too. Now the Volvo Cross Country...I don't know what was on my mind.

544	August 1, 2004 5:44AM	anonymousposts	"The bad part about working at a dealership when you are a CCB is you are tempted by every good deal you find. The good part about it is that if you are going to go through cars often anyways at least you will get better deals, theoretically anyways.

akangl: If the dealership does pretty good business you should at least give it a trial period. If you know the product you should do OK. If you LOVE the product you will do even better. That was my downfall while in sales. It was hard to get excited about cars I really didn't like. Someone would ask me if I would buy that purple 1997 Suzuki Sidekick with 100,000 miles and it was hard to not tell my true feelings. I should've given a Honda dealership a shot given my love/knowledge of the product but I never did and now I just don't want to deal with being in sales.

I guess you should ask yourself if there is something else that you would rather do. If you like what you do money isn't always the most important factor. If you and your hubby are doing OK without you working then like I said just give it a 60 day trial."

I'm not sure how much volume they do, but from what I understood talking to Kelly today (she's a salesperson there) they are more into volume than gross right now. In other words, you can sell a lot of minis.

My biggest problem is what to do with my rugrats, they start school in 3 weeks and the dealership is 100 miles away. So, if we can work that detail out then I'm going to give it a shot I think. Hubby and I are headed out fishing on Monday, so will talk a lot during the 6 hours of driving. We want to make sure its ok with the kids too.

I have an amazing love of selling cars, I have the gift of gab (gee, does it show??), and can deal with just about anyone. Oh boy, why do I have a feeling I'm gonna be selling cars again??

 He had an '89 Taurus SHO that mysteriously caught fire last week. It was parked for several days when this happened. But wait...there's more. The headlights came on, the wipers were going, and it started cranking... never started(lookout ""Christine"")but the starter pulled the car along, dragging the rears, pushed sister-in-laws Civic out of the way, and stopped 50 yard down, against a neighbors drive, that contained an '04 Volvo S60 and '04 G35x. Nothing but the Ford and Honda were damaged.

He also owned or still owns a warmed over '96 Suburban 4X4, a mid 70s Honda motorcycle, a 67 El Camino, and an early 70s CJ. And he has brought home and fixed and sold about 20 cars in the last 3 years.

574	August 4, 2004 3:21PM	driftracer	"<soapbox mode on>

I'm not defending Wal-Mart, I'm defending jobs in general...

""Most revolve around low pay, terrible benefits, and they are VERY strict when it comes to schedule adherence""

Many people are part-timers, so they get paid what they qualify for - if you want more money, get more qualifications and get away from retail - everey retailer pays poorly, because they can, and you don't have to have a PhD to work a cash register.

Most part-time positions in the nation don't give many benefits - that's what happens with part-time jobs - go full-time, or..

VERY strict on scheduling? I hope so! Why not - if you're scheduled to be on the job at a certain time, be there! You had a week's notice, and in my opinion after working in retail, only the death of a family member or having yourself involved in an accident are excuses that would keep you from being fired the second time you're late.

I need you to be at work so someone else can go home - be there, or find another job.

<soapbox mode off>

Final note: If you want to support your CCB habit and you can't afford it with your part-time job, ask for a raise, or go back to school and get some qualifications to get a better-paying job."
575	August 4, 2004 3:24PM	kyfdx	"I've noticed it is the other way around.. Getting the second job causes your CCB to increase, even if that wasn't the original intent.

577	August 4, 2004 3:45PM	andre1969	"for about 9 years. When I was in college I had a part time job at a department store, but then got hired part time as well by a government contractor my last year in college. That went on to a full time job, but I kept the part time job anyway.

Then I bought a condo and got married, and that part time job didn't cut it anymore, so I started delivering pizzas. For awhile I was actually working THREE jobs, but phased out the department store job pretty quickly. I think I was making $7.86 an hour when I left that job, whereas deliving pizzas, well if I brought home less than $15-16 an hour, after taxes (including paycheck) well that was a bad week!

In my case though, the second job didn't contribute to my chronic car buying. It did get me out of debt pretty quickly once my ex-wife sunk me financially, though!

Sometimes I've thought about trying to pick up another part time job, but I've just gotten to the point that I think my free time is more valuable. Plus, when I delivered pizzas, I was mainly working with kids who were around 16-20. That was one thing when I was 25-30, but now I'm 34, but most of the employees are still gonna be around 16-20, and I'm even further removed from that age bracket. I just wouldn't have the patience to put up with the BS anymore. From employees or customers! Although I'll hand it to them...the vast majority of my customers were great people. There were just those chronic few who went through life being miserable and nasty. They'd do it to me, the lady at the checkout line at the grocery store, the person who sold them their last car, the waiter that served them, etc."

K-mart seems just the opposite, though. This past Sunday, I took in an old car battery for a core charge refund, and the lady at the counter was nothing but nasty. Probably didn't want to be working on a Sunday, and hating her job, and just taking it out on the customers. Now normally I'm very nice to retail people, having worked it myself for so many years. But get nasty with me, and you'll get it returned. And she did.

I've seemed to notice that with K-mart in general, though; this was not just an isolated incident! In fact, I had friends waiting in the car while I ran in, and they were laying odds on whether I'd come out of the store pissed or not!"

And then one time, I took a delivery to the EconoLodge, and, well, for lack of a better term, I think it was a ""Daddy"" and his ""Boi"". Let's just say that they were both wearing an awful lot of leather for a hot summer night!!!

I'd run into a few freaks here and there, but that whole time delivering pizzas, I never encountered anything really dangerous. Well, once I did have a guy cut me off and when I honked my horn at him, he flashed a badge. So I called the cops and said there was a reckless driver in a purple S-10 blazer flashing a badge, who might be trying to impersonate a police officer. And I did have a teenager run a stop sign in the parking lot and T-bone my '86 Monte Carlo. And once, in the Gran Fury, I had a teenager stand in the middle of the road and try to block my exit (dead-end road). But in all those years, never anything TRULY dangerous. But then, one night over a year after I had quit, I got mugged right outside my own front door, so go figure. It can happen anywhere :-("
583	August 4, 2004 6:17PM	andre1969	"at least when I worked for Papa John's, just about everything was done by computer, and we had a database with everybody's address who had ever ordered from us. And I had been working there long enough that chances are, I knew who I was delivering to before I even left the door, so there weren't going to be TOO many surprises.

That computer database helped out alot, too. For instance, that drunken teenager who was blocking the road and being an annoyance? Well, I looked up the address of the house he had come from (right next door to where my delivery had been), and found that they had odered from us before. So I called the cops, and gave them the address AND phone #!

It also came in handy when one night, I saw some kids in the bushes shining a laser pointer into people's eyes as they drove by. While it was really just an annoyance to me, it could've scared the hell out of some little old lady, or given some Vietnam War vet bad flashbacks. So I figured I'd give them a scare. I made a u-turn up the street, and just as I was about to pass by the spot, I cut the wheel, hopped the curb, and stopped with the car right at the edge of the bushes. They ran their little hineys back to their house with record speed! I hollered a few obscenities, when I saw this thing that looked like an iceberg in a Mu-Mu standing at the sliding glass door, silhouetted by inside light. I hollered up that their kids were shining a laser pointer in people's eyes. She simply shot back ""WELL THEY'RE NOT DOING IT ANYMORE!"" That was it. No apology, no nothing. Well, they had ordered from us as well. And got a little visit from the police, as well!"
584	August 4, 2004 7:16PM	harlequin1971	"I spent my 3 years working delivery and inside for a major company...

In the end, the risks got too high (crime had jumped and we served a poor neighborhood) to accept. I quit.

Several months later, a boy that I had trained in (first delivery, first pizza, first close, phone script and upselling, etc.) was delivering a pizza to one of our less favorite complexes. He was shoot 7 times in the back (leaving the delivery) by some drugged out low-life from a second story window. He ended up paralyzed for life but he did survive. The low-life said he did it because his friend dared him to.

I stand by my reasoning and timing to get out of the pizza delivery business. Most waiters don't have to worry about people cutting them off, running red lights into them at midnight, or shooting them in the back...not worth $.50/delivery, minimum wage, and a tip."
585	August 4, 2004 7:37PM	andre1969	"the guy who was our manager at the time when I finally quit had been driving once for another location, in a bad neighborhood. He dropped off the pizza at an apartment complex and got paid, and as he was leaving got held up at gunpoint. He gave the guy his money, but the guy then pulled the trigger! The bullet went through the side of his shirt, and out the other side. At that point, he felt he had nothing to lose, so he rushed the robber, knocked the gun out of his hand, and beat the holy hell out of him.

Cops show up a few minutes later (a miracle in this county), and tell the manager to get up and get his hands behind his head! Then they ask him where all the blood is coming from. He said probably because he's been beating the &%#@ out of this low-life who just shot at him, but then they said ""No, that blood from your side"".

Turns out, the bullet HAD hit him, but with the fear and adrenaline, I guess he didn't feel it.

Well, in a sick twist of fate, this would-be robber had the nerve to take my manager to court and try to sue HIM! Thankfully our legal system, while hopelessly screwed, isn't THAT hopelessly screwed. That case got thrown out, and my manager countersued and one a judement of $56,000.

At the time, they were still waiting for this guy to get a job so his paycheck could be attached!

Looking back on things, if I needed money I think I would try to get a job waiting tables, instead of delivering pizzas. Just too much risk involved with driving.

It was also about 3 years ago when I finally quit, so in my neighborhood things could be totally different. I actually quit 3 times. First time I quit in November 2000, mainly because I was fed up. But my manager, whom I thought was pretty cool, coaxed me back and I started working again in January 2001. I was working fewer hours though, by choice, and not bringing in nearly as much per week, although it was still probably around $15-16 an hour. But I got fed up again and quit again in April, while he was on vacation.

I decided to try coming back that fall. By this time though, I didn't really need the money, although I thought some extra income would be nice. Well, by this time they went through a management upheaval, and had some buffoon from corporate trying to run things. We never could keep a manager for very long at our store, and every once in awhile they'd put in a corporate lackey to try and figure out why, and he'd make things more screwed up than the regular managers did! Well, I went back to work on 9/10/01. Then 9/11 hit, which, looking back at my records, we actually did fairly well that night. But after that, our business sunk. I worked there 3 more weeks after that, decided it wasn't worth the aggravation, and that I really enjoyed my newfound freedom that came from quitting the second job, and bid it a fond farewell.

I still know a few people who know people who work there, and they say that there still has never been a good manager in there, and they don't do nearly the business volume they did back in the day. So who knows? Maybe I got out just in time, too!"

Having said that, here is my log of events surrounding the car's purchase...

7/29/2004 &#150; I sign documents to lease the car and agree to pick it up July 30. I am offered gap insurance for $395 and a tire protection plan for $495. I only want the gap insurance, but am offered both together for $495, which I agree to. However, the $495 is listed only as &#147;tire protection plan&#148; on the lease. Later, I obtain information noting that they marked up the money factor and failed to inform me that I could significantly lower my payment by placing a security deposit. I also discover that all BMW Financial Services leases include gap protection at no additional cost (my lease was a BMWFS lease). Upon reviewing the tire protection plan, I discover that the plan is fully refundable within 45 days. I decide to obtain a refund of the $495 charge through the insurance company instead of telling the dealership I no longer want it.

7/30/2004 &#150; I inform the sales manager that there is something awry with the rent charge on the lease, and quote the 0.0022 BMWFS lease money factor from Edmund&#146;s. He admits that the lease charge was marked up, that&#146;s how the finance department makes money, etc., and that the rate I noted would require one security deposit of $500. I reply that the *dealership* has made *plenty* of money on this sale, and I would be willing to provide a security deposit but not a down payment. They agree to change the terms of the lease if I agree to pay the retail charge for acquisition fee instead of them giving it to me at cost. Because this is a significant net savings for me, I agree. I get all the paperwork necessary for my father to cosign the lease, and agree to return it by Monday.

7/31/2004 &#150; My father comes into town to sign the paperwork (they wanted it notarized if he didn&#146;t do it there), and all seems well. I note that I did not receive a copy of the lease paperwork, they retained all the copies.

8/2/2004 &#150; I receive a call from the sales manager explaining that they did not include sales tax in the lease due to a computer error. The docs need to be signed again, and he wants to send a courier to do it. I explain that I will be returning to town Tuesday night, and offer to handle all the transportation of paperwork myself. He explains that they will only count the sale in last month&#146;s sales for my salesman if I don&#146;t have to handle it, supposedly to minimize my inconvenience. He offers me a free tank of gasoline. I reluctantly agree, and he says that my salesman will be in touch. I tell my dad about the paperwork fiasco, and he says he has no problem meeting the courier as long as it&#146;s not tomorrow. I promise him not to have the courier sent tomorrow.

8/3/2004 &#150; I receive two voicemails from my salesman and return them within an hour. He explains that he has already spoken with my father (the cosigner), and a courier is already on the way to obtain his signature at his place of work, and estimates his arrival at my house at 1:00. At this point, it is prudent to note that I never agreed to have the courier come on this date, nor was I asked if I was available, just told that he was on the way, and I then agreed that I would be home around 1:00. At 2:30, my dad calls and tells me he has not yet seen the courier. I tell him not to wait up, he has to leave work by 3:00 and it&#146;s not his problem. At 3:00, he calls and tells me that he just met the courier. I explain that I have somewhere else to be, and am walking out the door. He obtains the phone number of the dealership so that they can tell the courier to go back to Lexington. He calls the dealership and rips the salesman a new orifice after finding out that they sent a geriatric courier on a ~300 mile roundtrip with no cell phone, also informs the salesman that he hopes they aren&#146;t counting on a favorable satisfaction survey. I receive a voicemail at work from my salesman and return his call, agreeing to come sign the papers before lunch tomorrow. He doesn&#146;t tell me what transpired on the phone between Dad and himself. Later, I receive another voicemail from my mother, who informs me that she has signed the paperwork because the courier got all tee&#146;d off that he had driven all that way for nothing. My father and I discuss the situation that night, and agree to do nothing until we think about it. As far as I&#146;m concerned, I am not (yet) a lawyer, but they have a falsified contract on their hands right now, possibly signed under duress or coercion.

8/4/2004 &#150; I have received no communication from the dealership, presumably because they have written off my satisfaction.

Did I mention that one of the worst things you can do to me is lie to me? And the two most common lies I am told which really, really get under my skin are that someone will call, and doesn't, or that they will show up at a certain time, and they don&#146;t.

I could have played dirty with them like they did with me. I could have tried to grind the price down after the fact by saying that my dad wouldn&#146;t cosign because he says I paid too much. I could have done any number of other things that would land me a subject of discussion in the &#147;Inconsiderate car buyers&#148; topic. I suppose I could still, like telling them that I no longer want the car due to their incompetence and deception.

I might have expected this from a Hyundai dealer, but I expect better of BMW, the world&#146;s greatest car company, and its dealer network. The selling dealership was Don Jacobs BMW in Lexington, Kentucky. They say they pride themselves on customer satisfaction, but as far as I&#146;m concerned, they&#146;re just another sleazy car dealership. For those of you who have made it this far, thanks for listening. What should I do?"
589	August 4, 2004 9:02PM	kyfdx	"All I know of Don Jacobs is that they seem to be high on price... and, being the only BMW dealer in Lexington, they have very little competition.

I would just look over the final lease paperwork very carefully, before taking delivery. It seems they tried to extract the last penny from you. $500 under MSRP at this time of year is just pitiful, even with the incentive deducted. All in all, not a bad lease for a $32K car, though.

590	August 4, 2004 9:06PM	kyfdx	"If you really want the car, just make sure the paperwork is correct, and take it... Do you live in Lexington, or will you be getting it serviced somewhere else?

If you are just completely fed up, you can start over and probably save some money, now that you have a little more knowledge, but you have to decide if its worth the hassle. In my experience, BMW sales is not much different from any other dealership.

However, based on what I have read and heard about Walmart, I would never recommend that someone get a job there if they have other alternatives. Fact is, their benefits and pay lag behind other retailers.

http://www.ufcw.org/press_room/fact_sheets_and_backgrounder/walma- rt/wages.cfm

Yeah it's a great job if that's all you can get. And if came down to working at Walmart or being on public assistance I would work at Walmart. However, again I say that it is not the choice for someone with better options.

As for the schedule adherence, I agree that you should be at work when scheduled. We have several chronically late people where I work now and it drives me insane. However, stuff happens and you shouldn't be fired if you have to take your child to the hospital.

I actually delivered pizzas for about 3 months after turning 18. It was a pretty low-crime area so I never ran into any trouble nor did anyone I worked with. Most crimes are property crimes with only 8.0% of crimes being violent. My biggest problem is that the women I delivered to didn't really tip that well. There were exceptions but on average men were much better tippers.

After 3 months or so I became a manager-in-training. It just wasn't worth it. Dealing with kids who were my age but much less mature, the hours, and sorry upper management led me to other pastures."
592	August 4, 2004 9:42PM	driftracer	"""However, stuff happens and you shouldn't be fired if you have to take your child to the hospital""

The problem is that with SOME folks, they've got a late excuse or the need for a day off 2-3 days per week - that, I don't tolerate.

I would never fault someone who had a legitimate emergency - who could you? But after you have 5-6 ""emergencies"" in a month, or your aunt died for the third time this year, it's time to move them on out to pasture.

If they're spending that much time thinking about ways to get out of work, they can't be doing that good of a job for you to begin with.

A tattoo? That goes beyond car junkie to downright crazy.

The information on that site mirrors what I have seen in the paper and what I have heard from people who work there. It could all be hogwash for all I know.

Unions have their issues. They are putting a big dent into the profits of GM and Ford. Same goes for other companies and industries as well.

We have one of the ""my kid stumped his toe so I need to leave"" mothers in my office right now. If I were the manager she would have been fired long, long ago. She leaves early at least once a week and calls in once every two weeks. This creates more work for everyone. We have another girl who is late in excess of 2-3 times a week for no reason other than she overslept. More than once when she was scheduled to open the office she came in 2 hours late. Even though I am a supervisor of sorts I do not have the authority to do anything beyond pull them into the office and slap them on the wrist and say ""no-no"". I stopped bringing it to upper management's attention because they are inconsistent when it comes to discipline.

On the Walmart Tire & Lube, a co-worker (the same chronically late one mentioned above) had her oil changed there and they over-filled it which caused the oil to spray all over the engine, etc. After arguing with the manager for a couple of days they agreed to repair the damage. She took the car to them to get it fixed and they over-filled it again."
596	August 4, 2004 10:16PM	driftracer	"drop me a line and I'll send you a photo of the NOS tattoo...

I had pretty good luck with Wal-Mart TLE until the last time I went - about 6 months ago. I always use Castrol Syntec synthetic oil and do the full blown deal for around $30 - most of the time, they forget to vacuum and clean the windows, but I don't make a stink.

This last time, though, my car was done and I was paying, and I noticed that the ""new guy"" had selected bulk 5W30 regular oil instead of synthetic - I asked about it, and he said ""that's what I give everyone"".

Oh, my God. I asked for a manager, and informed him that I use synthetic, and that I'd been charged extra, but got cheap junk instead - how many people specified a particular brand, weight, or type of oil and got bulk that day? Or the week before?

They pulled my car back in and changed the oil, using the 5W30 Syntec like I originally requested. The manager offered me a free oil change for next time. I didn't take him up on it - burned once already.

Like I always do, I double check the dipstick and make sure all of the oil and reservior caps are secure - sure as heck, the oil cap wasn't, and had fallen down beside a motor mount, and oil had blown all over the motor.

Lucky I checked it, because I had a 32-mile drive home on the turnpike, although I'm thinking my engine would have gone south by the time I hit the main road...

They steam cleaned the engine, changed the oil again, and cut me loose - a quick conference with the store manager netted me a $100 gift card. I spend $250 a week there, that's the least they could do."

600	August 4, 2004 11:08PM	anonymousposts	I had an oil cap left off of my car one time. I kept smelling oil but assumed they had spilled oil on the engine and it was just burning off. Well by the time I pulled in my driveway there was smoke coming from the engine. Popped the hood and there was no oil cap. Worst part is I had it changed where I work. They reimbursed me for the lost oil cap, cleaned the engine, and gave me a free oil change which I used only because it was free. Since then I have not let them work on any of my cars.

So, we'll see, I hope I get it, then my mom won't have to work a second job anymore because we will pay her car payment and insurance in exchange for her staying with the kids 3 nights per week (sometimes less).

I stopped by the Nissan dealer today and as much as I really want to sell cars I've decided that its not a big enough volume store to make any real money. They run 50-100 units per month among 10-12 sales people. The store I worked at 5 years ago was a HUGE volume store (at least for Fairbanks), they ran 300/400 units per month among about 15 to 20 salespeople, easy to make money there."
604	August 5, 2004 3:00AM	kyfdx	"By ""start over"", I meant with another dealership.. But, if you are in Lexington, that may not be much of an option. Actually, Don Jacobs service dept. has a decent reputation, and they actually host some events for the Bluegrass chapter of the BMW CCA, which is based in Louisville, but has many members from Lexington.

I've shopped Swope in Louisville and the two Cincinnati dealers and haven't had much luck in getting a bargain. Voss BMW in the south end of Dayton seems a little more flexible on price, but thats a long way to go.

If you made a deal that you were reasonably happy with, don't let a couple of goofballs at the dealership ruin it for you. If you live in Lexington, you'll want to take your car there for service, as there really aren't many other options. Just go over the paperwork closely, and make sure it reflects the deal you agreed on.

I figured out a long time ago that ""premium brand"" doesn't mean diddly when it comes to sales or service, except that the coffee and doughnuts in the service department at my local BMW dealer is a step up from the Honda dealer.

I was at my parents house in NE Pennsylvania and Walmart was the only place open on Christmas. I have no complaint about the job they did as the tire was patched in an hour an never gave me any problems afterwards.

Even then, the next time I go, it could be all new people.

I have mine changed at the local dealer. $17 and they fill everything. Yeah, it might be a doofus-in-training they kept hid in the back that does the LOF, but the head mechanic there is my next door neighbor and the other mechanic has been doing the job as long as I've known him. Both ASE-certified. (And I KNOW it doesn't take an ASE-certified tech to change oil, but hell, if I take it somewhere where all the guys are goof-offs, I might as well do it myself).

I'd love to take it to the C-D-J dealership where my roommate works. 9.95 for LOF/fill everything, plus they wash the car. Can't beat that.

As far as Wal-Mart and UFCW goes, neither one of them are winners of any PR prizes, IMO. I just don't go to Wal-Mart out of priniciple and well, let's just say I've got a principle on unions, too and leave it at that. There are no fewer 7 or 8 massive, full-service, non-union, non-Walmart supermarkets in Green Bay. Any one of them is more or less price competitive with equally good selection as Wal-Mart.

They did leave a note so it wasn't a hit and run. I made a copy of the case number and note to give to the dealership. The sales manager who agreed to allow the return of the car wasn't there yet, so I put everything on his desk. I called him later to make sure everything was okay--he said they would take care of it. Neither one of us was surprised at the latest development, given everything else that happened. I'm glad that's over with!

Right now, I'm cleaning up my Altima since I'm still going to try to sell it. The body shop repainted the off-color bumper, although it still doesn't fit perfectly, most people wouldn't notice or be bothered. Lessons learned: Use OEM parts, and referrals for sales and service are different than those for bodywork (this dealership has great sales and service, and a crummy body shop). If I sell it, I will just borrow my parents' GMC Canyon until I make a decision. I will miss having four doors, but that's about it. Just having that change of pace ***may*** tide me over for 3/6/12 months, but I can make no promises, I'm a CCB...

I can get any new Ford/Lincoln/Mercury or Pontiac/GMC (or anything used from those manufacturer's auctions) at a fair price with no haggling, but I can't bring myself to like any of those other than the X-Type and perhaps the S60 (if those aren't separate from the Ford auctions). The Maxima, Grand Prix Comp-G, and TL all look nice on paper, but the torque steer on those would probably land me in the median on the first rainy or snowy day each season.

Let's see........I paid $11k for my car ($3k under invoice) and get 35 mpg hwy. He paid $23k for his car ($1k over MSRP) and figure he'll get 50 mpg hwy. Granted his car has leather/sunroof and is a sedan. Ok, so I could have bought that in a Focus for probably $4k more than what we paid for the ZX3. Anyway......what I'm giggling about is he's going to have to drive that car for 300k miles to make up the difference between a comparable Focus and the Jetta.

I tried to steer him towards a Corolla, 40+ mpg and a $16k price tag, but he was adament that the Jetta was *cheaper*. Hmmmmmm.......having owned 2 Jettas I KNOW what the repair costs are when its out of warranty.......can we say OUCH!!!

624	August 8, 2004 5:22PM	akangl	The demand for the TDI is high, there's apparently a waiting list. Then again there's only one dealer so that could be why. I think everyone pays over MSRP for any VW up here. Personally I'd head to Seattle and buy there before I paid over MSRP for a Jetta.
625	August 8, 2004 6:03PM	driftracer	good move on the lady's Jaguar...

Ditto, and I'm from Kentucky... Can you say ""road trip?"" I'd never pay over MSRP for any car. There are some clowns on another site trying to take preorders for their allocations of the new M5, noting that ""there will be a premium."" We all know that any M-series is a kick-[non-permissible content removed] car, but I'd never pay silly money for anything.

I looked at the TSX at the auto show, it's nice, but the interior is kind of cheapish compared to the TL or even the Accord. I'll give Courtesy Acura a try, they are only showing 22 cars on their lot on their website. I absolutely love the blue TL with the tan interior, though.

Mom has an S80, which is the reason I am not hot on Volvos anymore. They flat killed their flagship when they went to the new platform. The old 960/S90 was a great car in its day, though."

Yeah, I think it's kind of short on the electronic gizmos that keep you from losing control... ABS and airbags weren't even available until '96 or so. I've driven an E46 M3 (the high-output, later US version), which was very controllable, although I know it would at least get me into trouble with the law."

630	August 9, 2004 3:23AM	stickguy	"plenty of torque, it just steers frm the other end.

I used to have a Maxima 5 speed, which was noted for torque steer. But, you really had to get conditions just right for it to really become an issue, and even then, you really just needed to hold onto the steering wheel (with more than 2 fingers preferably).

I must admit a few years back I was of the opinion that by the millennium or very soon after they would no longer be selling cars here without A/C. Since it is so tied into the defrost now on most cars, and is in such high demand by consumers. And yet, they have proven me wrong!

As for the p/w, I only wish there were still more cars made with manual wind-down windows...but I would not buy a new car today without A/C, because I would fear for the difficulty of selling it later on...it's hard enough selling the stick shift cars I usually buy! :-P

648	August 10, 2004 4:56PM	stickguy	"Yup, I remember it (from Toyotas early ""C"" phase). Basically, it was the larger, more up-scale sedan in the 70's (not sure if it made it into the '80s or not). You had the Corolla, and the Corona was the big brother. Probably the closest equivilant is the Camry today, although conceptually it probably would also cover the Avalon.

It was probably equivalent to the Datsun 810 (later Maxima) in those doays, but maybe slightly smaller.

Edit: Actually, the Cressida was closer to the 810/Maxima, so the Corona basically morphs into the Camry."

Ironically, it was the last new car my parents bought until they purchased their '03 Hyundai Sonata GLS V6 18 months ago.

Unfortunately, I totalled the Corona one day on my way to school in 1982. Broadsided some lady in a large American sedan when she made a U-turn in front of me ... she took off after the accident.

Our next door neighbor had a 2 door Corolla ('70 or '71, IIRC) in the same color.

I think the last model year for the Corona was '83, since I believe the Camry was introduced as an '84 model. In it's last years the Corona was available as both a 4-door sedan and as a 5-door hatchback."

The other thing to keep in mind is that an SR5 is probably a better buy than an AE86, since they don't have the cache but are still RWD. Assuming you're going to build the car beyond all reason anyway, this is easily the most economical way to go. I highly recommend it (or a 240, whichever appeals to you more)."

We were in Ohio for a family reunion. The Odyssey did splendidly. It carried 3 people, a baby, 8 large duffel bags, a baby bath tub, and a baby stroller with lots of room to spare. Our average speed was 75 MPH or so and she gave us 24MPG over the 1400 miles we drove even with the AC being on most of the time. I can't believe we have been traveling in cars all of these years. A mini-van is definitely THE choice for long interstate trips. The van is supposed to go back in about 19 months. While I don't think we want to buy this one (the new Ody will have a sunroof and XM supposedly) I will definitely consider a 2007 Odyssey when we send the Accord back in 3 years."

At least I finally get to put my new car (Scion tC) in the garage. I hate having to park outside, and in a few days I won't.

My daughter at least figured out the secret plan. Once the Miata is gone, it gives me an excuse to look for another toy, just one a lot cheaper than a 10K + Miata (should have bought a 3K early model instead).

Actually, the wife has been semi-patiently tapping her foot waiting her turn to get new wheels. Once the cehck for the Miata shows up, she can start looking seriously (at least once the new models come out in September). Pretty soon we may be a dual-2005 family, although consolidation may mean no payments if I can keep her away from Acura and Volvo.

I still believe that buying my Scion was fiscally prudent, since I sold 2 cars and spent less than the total amount received on the new one, which in theory (wink wink, don't tell my wife) will keep me out of the market for a number of years.

Anyway, Eric said he has a clip from a turbo Starlet with an auto trans. Usually gets only 5-speeds (which I would actually prefer), but since the auto is harder to sell, will give me a good price on it. Says Toyota is more aggressive with their turbos on their automatic cars, so it's a good choice in that regard. I'll keep you posted on the results (we're talking 180 hp minimum, up to about 250).

The Legacy was most impressive of the bunch, but after driving ""everything,"" now I know that the 3-series is the perfect car for me. But, I start law school orientation Friday, so there's no time to do another car deal.

Last week I was rear-ended in the Canyon. No injuries, but I was really upset because this is four wrecks in six months. Also, the wreck wouldn't have happened if the van behind me had ABS--it slid on drywall that I and the traffic in front of me didn't.

I just realized that if I keep the Altima three years until I finish law school, I could give it to my (10 years) younger cousin who will be getting his driver's license about that time.

You know, I thought part of the Jaguar appeal was the refinement, and I don't see that coexisting with a small-block... With a recent Jag, you can just find a nice CPO for peace of mind and know that you will probably sell it long before the 6/100 warranty is up.

That statement couldn't be any more true. Hopefully, we will have saved money in the long run by leasing the Accord and Odyssey. It's much harder to be a CCB with leased cars. Although we still have one that's paid for (lexus) and one that we have some equity in (civic si)."
717	August 18, 2004 2:50AM	badtoy	yep -- the same one that's in the new Lotus Elise bound for the US. It does low 13s, and it weighs the same as my Paseo, so anything close to 200 hp will make it a rocket. My only concern is torque steer, but since it's a JDM motor, I should be able to buy any steering or suspension components available on the Starlet (the Japan version of the Tercel).

The stupid popup broke the second day of our trip, couldn't get the furnace to turn back on. So, I took it to the dealer yesterday, they say nothing was wrong, just had to flip the reset, uh, I did that, TWICE. Good thing it wasn't all that cold out, just a bit chilly. Stove broke too, they fixed that yesterday. Just frustrating, but I'm thankful for the warranty on the dumb thing.

The Titan is flawless as always, I love that truck. I can honestly say I can't imagine getting rid of it, usually by the 2 month mark my eyes are wandering again. Not this time, turned 9k last night and I enjoy the truck as much as I did when it was new.

To answer your question, no, I'm not aware of a kit (yet) to install a 2ZZ in a Tercel/Paseo, although installing one now in a Corolla should be cake, since they're doing it at the factory now.

I've already talked to EL Prototypes about it, and they recommend simply installing a JDM turbo Starlet motor, since it's a bolt-in and is capable of up to 250 hp reliably. They're also pretty cheap now, so that's a real plus, since a 2ZZ engine alone would probably run me around $4-5k. The Starlet option should run about $2k out the door, and although it presents problems with smog certification, it will certainly fulfill all of the performance parameters. I'll keep you posted."

alloys shod with some decent thread left, AC to freeze your kiwis, and
cruise control. I swear he musta special ordered it to get the LSi with
crankers, but what the heck.

And yes, the clutch IS shot, definitely needs new wear parts -- a $600 job
as per my mechanic. Maybe the master cyl as well, maybe that's why it went
bad...
Dealer had offered $700 trade-in against his new Vibe on some GM
Family&Friends deal, that sounds about right.

Anyway, I offer -- and he accepts -- $1001, $101 down, $900 when I get the
car this weekend. I'll let the pros attack the interior, new clutch, a few

I've eaten at a five-star restaurant and it was worth the price... that said, I can only afford to do it on very special occasions. It is dropping the $50-$60 to eat at a place like Longhorn or Outback that I can't stomach. The steaks from my butcher are better and cheaper, even at $11.99/lb.

I can't stand paying some bloke ten bucks to park my car illegally on the street two blocks away so I can eat said $25 meal.

At the same time, I have no problem dropping $50 sitting at a bar all night so a bartender can twist the caps off my Miller Lite that I could more easily drink at home @ 75 cents a pop. Guess that tells you something about my priorities, eh?!"

It is amazing.. I don't want to spend a 5% markup to buy a car, but I'll pay a 300% markup for the beer at the bar.. I guess I like the atmosphere better at the bar, than the car dealer.

786	August 26, 2004 9:06PM	michaellno	"I've worked in downtown Denver for 11 years and, for the first 6-7 of them, parking was a benefit paid for by my company. Then, my company was bought by a large multinational organization and the benefit went away. On top of that, I switched jobs and now come into the office every day (before I travelled out of town 1-2 weeks per month).

Granted, it's only $4 per day ($7-$10 when the Rockies have a day game), but it still grates on me to have the cash available to ""rent"" a piece of concrete for 9 or 10 hours.

For a couple of years I was assigned to a different location on the south side of town (closer to where I live) where parking was free. Needless to say, I was not happy to be transferred back downtown and have to start paying again! Not to mention that the commute effectively doubled in length and time.

Grrr!

PS Is it Friday yet?

PPS On a more positive note, we will be paying off our VW New Beetle this month, which frees up the cash to get my wife a new car when we're ready.

787	August 26, 2004 9:19PM	jlawrence01	"You are right, they did not have the stars out front. I lived/worked in a resort town where nearly every restaurant was a white table cloth place where the entrees were $20+. At the time ~20 years ago, I was making $300 a week.

If you want to go to a family restaurant, you drove 20 miles. You want to go to a fast food place, it was closer to 40. It was a real PITA so on weekends, I headed to and spent the weekend in Newport News with friends.

Coming from the town you currently reside in, it was culture shock not having the ability to eat out occasionally during the week."
788	August 26, 2004 9:25PM	kyfdx	"Yup.. if you are a ""foodie"", this is the place to be. Even if your price range is sub-$20, there are dozens of really good places to eat around here. I live three miles from downtown.... so, just about anything I want is within 7-8 miles at most.

I tranferred to a rural town (oxymoron?) for eight months about 15 years ago... I begged my boss to take me back. Somehow, eating at the ""Bun Boy"" on Saturday night just didn't cut it.

789	August 26, 2004 11:24PM	anonymousposts	"I'm in total agreement with those who say anything over $20 PP is pushing it. The atmosphere may get nicer but the food rarely gets better. I can spend $15 at Macaroni Grill/Olive Garden and be perfectly happy. Heck, I can spend $5 at Taco Bell or Quizno's and be happier. The company you are with is usually what makes or breaks the meal anyways.

Gee and I are used to the drive now. It's only 25-30 miles to the closest Olive Garden. Super Target and Walmart are about 15 miles away. Fortunately, our area is still developing so much of the commute is done on a 4 lane highway with no lights (yet) and a 65MPH speed limit. It REALLY helps that we like what we drive."
790	August 27, 2004 12:08AM	steine13	"...is it even possible to be off-topic in CCBA?
I'd say not.

It's fun to hear people arguing that $xx dinners are PLENTY good enough for them....
Or people arguing that $xx cars are good enough...

'Cuz it's exactly the same thing. One gets the job done, the other has that little extra, the je ne sais quoi. You makes your decisions, you spends your money.

I can appreciate quality in both cases, I just don't need to have it all the time... the best deal my wife and I ever got on dinner was $100 at the little Italian Restaurant on the main drag in Carmel, CA. Yeah it was a lot of money, but the food was wonderful, everything made from scratch, and tasted great. Can't do it every week, but to me, it's money well spent.

With cars, well, I love driving high-end cars, but it's really not worth the $$ for me. Still and all, fenster's E320 I might have bought, had it not been clear across the country... those are great...
It's all a matter of taste.

791	August 27, 2004 12:32AM	anonymousposts	"Best dinner we have had was probably ... at a restaurant in Kansas City. The Bristol was the name I think. It's been about 8 years ago or so. It was $70 or $80 for the two of us and it was worth it. A close second was our first experience at Maggiano's .. second time wasn't as good as the first though. We've had a lot of good meals but I'm not sure if the places above could even be described as exceptional. They were just ""darn good"". Now we don't have enough time together to go out to eat so we usually eat at places like Quizno's when we do the baby swap so I can go home and he can go to work. Good news is, we have plenty of cars so we probably won't have to worry about how to get there when we do get time to eat at a nice place again"
792	August 27, 2004 12:58AM	andyman73	"to join in on the food binge. Just last week I was in the OC, Maryland area at Whiskey Joe's/Bay Cafe, 6 adults and 1 toddler= 170 before tip. Service was great, food was absolute garbage! I couldn't tell where the flounder ended and the crab stuffing began. Now the best prime rib I ever ate, was at Silk City Diner, outside of Ephrata, Pa. Just so happened to be the 12.95 special of the night, for a 20 ouncer! I have eaten 30 dollar prime, and that 13 dollar special absolutely takes the cake. It tasted like you imagine it should. Wonderful!

Oh here's the car bit, was at my rental storage unit the other day. They also have a 2nd hand car lot. On the high end side, there was a sharp black Merc AMG 500 (SL500 I think) parked next to a red Viper, and black 911 turbo. The drool was nearly running down my chin.

To be brutally honest, I could still be driving my old 1968 Buick Special Deluxe station wagon which would probably have well over 400K+ miles today. The body would probably be ready to fall off the frame but that powertrain was darn near bulletproof. Heck, ever replacing the entire powertrain in that car would be less than the cheapest Kia on the market. The only true kiss of death would be metal fatigue."

796	August 27, 2004 3:34PM	kyfdx	"2-speed automatics were never ""fabulous"". LOL What did Chevy call theirs? Powerglide? I never got the reason for not adding another gear."
797	August 27, 2004 4:01PM	andre1969	"because GM was just behind the times, but also because they had to have some kind of justification for moving to a bigger and more luxurious car. What better way to do that than stick 2-speed automatics in the Chevies and 3 or 4-speeds in the nicer cars?

FWIW, a 2-speed tranny isn't that bad if you have a big enough engine. I once drove a '58 DeSoto Firesweep that had a Mopar 350 (one of the earlier displacements of the 361/383/400 block, and only offered in '58). It had a 280 hp setup, and just a Powerflite 2-speed automatic. It didn't seem to hold that car back much at all.

I also once drove a 1960 Olds Ninety-Eight hardtop coupe that *should* have had a 4-speed Hydramatic in it, but I swear this one only had some kind of 2-speed! I only felt it shift once when accelerating, and it seemed to be over-revving at highway speeds. But considering it had the interior of a 1960 Bonneville, it's not too hard of a stretch to imagine that it didn't have the original tranny in it, either! It also had a 394 (IIRC) 4-bbl, so again, it had no trouble accelerating, despite that 2-speed tranny!

Another area Chevy was really behind the times with was oil filters. Mopar went to a spin-on oil filter for 1958. I think Pontiac's first year was 1959. Well, my '57 DeSoto still uses the old fashioned drop-in cartridge that's inside the metal cannister. There's the cannister, filter, a bunch of gaskets, and it's all held together by a really long bolt, and makes a big mess every time you change the oil. Well, under normal circumstances, a 1957 DeSoto oil filter would probably be almost impossible to find, except for the fact that Chevy was still using that same part in 1967!"

For the Mustang it's the live axle and for the 300C you can't get a manual transmission."
799	August 27, 2004 5:09PM	lemko	"...had a 230 hp 350 V-8 mated to the two-speed tranny. I guess that's why I never had any complaint about it. There was a saying deriding the old two speed, ""Slip and Slide with Powerglide.""

Andre, there is no aftermarket maker for those cannister oil filters? Did you stock up on a lifetime's supply of 1967 Chevrolet filters? I think by 1967, the Chevrolet V-8 was using the spin-on type of filter. The six must've had the cannister filter for my Dad's 1961 Chevrolet Biscayne's inline six used a cannister filter."
800	August 27, 2004 5:19PM	andre1969	"it was 1968 that Chevy switched over to the spin-on filter, at least looking through Fram's online catalog. Another thing I noticed is that the part number for the Chevy filter is different from the DeSoto filter, at least in Fram's book! Oops. About 4 years ago, I found half a case of AC Delco filters for a Chevy, and the guy at the parts counter said that the number was the same for DeSoto and Chevy. At least, with Delco! And eyeballing them, they looked identical to me! Fram does still make the DeSoto filter, but over the past few years it was getting harder to find in the auto parts stores. When I first bought that car in 1990, I could actually go to Trak Auto, and they had them...in stock! No need to special order. They also had the proper accessory belts, which I thought was a shock. Now radiator hoses, that's a different story...

But it was common to convert the older Chevy engines so that they could take the spin-on filter like the '68 and newer engines.

Also, I'd imagine that a Buick 350 wouldn't be too bad with a 2-speed tranny, in an intermediate car. 230 hp might not sound like a lot of hp for a 350 (a Mopar 318-2bbl also had 230 hp, and I think a mild Chevy 327 had like 250 hp?), but that Buick 350 would have plenty of torque."
801	August 28, 2004 12:27AM	andyman73	Since we're talking of the 60s, I had an A** kicking experience. While in the Marines, a fellow Marine was selling a 65 Olds, full size 2 door, with the 425 Rocket, and 4 barrel. She was asking only.................500.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And it ran very smoothly, no smoke from dual exhuast! I hemmed and hawed too long, and her husband(also Marine) was returning from Japan, and had decided to restomod it. Doggonit!!! Oh well, that's what happens when you sit on your thumbs. With today's gas prices, it wouldn't be very gas pump friendly, still, would be neat to run around in, in good weather.
802	August 28, 2004 1:15AM	lemko	...only had the two barrel carb. I'm not sure what the hp rating was on something like the GS350 which likely had the 4 barrel. You could get a 250 cube inline six in a Special Deluxe but I'm sure one is rare.
803	August 28, 2004 2:37AM	andyman73	I was wrong, as I was remembering that 65, I realized it was 4 door. It was white with dark blue interior, cloth. The only thing I am sure of is the Rocket 425 w/4 barrel carb, and dual exhuast. IIRC, also had Olds varient of Posi rearend. I remember opening the hood, that motor was huge, could eat a picnic off the top. Plus all the room around the motor, for more motor, I suppose.

It was kind of a teal/bluish-green color, with a matching interior. Pretty upscale interior too, with cloth and carpeting on the door panels. For that timeframe, that was pretty upscale, as most cars just gave you vinyl, with the more upscale ones giving you carpeting on the lower door panels. To actually have cloth must've really been upscale in a mainstream family car like that!

They only wanted $800 for it. I should've bought it, or at least investigated a little more closely!"

813	August 28, 2004 11:21PM	seminole_kev	"Just popped by a couple of new car lots today on a whim.

Looked at the Dodge Magnum. Ehhh. On paper I should like it, but the Dodge truck front on it turns me off and man-O-man does that sucker have some blind spots. Probably better off with a periscope to look out of it. Didn't drive it. Just looked.

Test drove a new Pontiac GTO. Road nicer than I thought and the interior was nicer than I expected as well (except for really cheap feeling AC controls). Only thing is...really is just lacking something. It is fast, that is sure, but it just is lacking in character I guess. Really the intake and exhaust could be louder and it could be a little more ""rowdy"" in my opinion. Just didn't strike a cord with me. Odd. Although to be fair, this is becoming more of a problem with any modern car. Just seem more and more ""disconnected"" from the fun.

Also looked at a new Scion tC. It looks about what it cost inside and out, but for the market it is in, it should work. Not bad. A little more generic looking in the flesh than in photos to me. Nothing special, but at that price break, they should still sell a boat load of them. Side note: I thought Scion had to have a seperate showroom? They were sitting mixed in with the Toyotas and were in the same showroom.

Oh, and the wife hated all three ;-)

*Sales person score card below.

Scion/Toyota dealer - slightly slimey.

Dodge dealer - ultra slime ball-ish.

Pontiac dealer - pretty darn good. I'll have to follow up with this guy when the Pontiac Solstice comes out."
814	August 28, 2004 11:29PM	badtoy	and interesting what you said about the GTO. Allow me, as a hard-core Toyota guy, to pass something along...CUSTOMIZE it. All you have to do to make the GTO rowdier is add an aftermarket exhaust, and maybe lower it an inch for a nastier look and crisper ride and handling -- maybe add a set of custom wheels while you're at it. That's it! We Toyota guys do it all the time, cuz that's the only way you get a mass-market car to act and look the way you want. If it's good in all the right departments -- power, handling, build quality, etc., and it just lacks that extra something -- add it yourself. The other obvious benefit to this is that you won't see yourself coming down the road at you.
815	August 29, 2004 12:07AM	seminole_kev	"customize? Never heard of it. Glad you Toyota boys invented it.... ;-)

Seriously, that's fine for used cars, but I'm not going to drop decent change on a new car that already, out of the box, doesn't do anything for me. That's not ""Grand Prix"" or ""Tempest"" printed on the side of that thing. It says G...T...O...

Obviously I don't think it lacks character, but badtoy's right, there are TONS of mods and customization options for the car. Everything from hoods, headers, intake, PCM mods, superchargers, body kits, spoilers, exhausts, mats, et. al. GM boosted the exhaust sound over the Holden (the GTO wouldn't pass Australia's strict noise-pollution tests), and they spent 20 million $ recreating the exhaust note of the '64.

Not sure if you test-drove the stick or the auto, but hope you turned off the traction control - it's like Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde when you do that. Also love the ""launch mode"" where the car squats down 2"" when you put it into drive - sure gets the adrenaline flowing :-)

819	August 29, 2004 12:12PM	anonymousposts	It's hard to believe GM ommitted a sunroof in the GTO. It's a performance bargain but at $30,000 most buyers expect to have a sunroof at least as an option. $30,000 with only 2 doors and no roof makes the 04 Acura TL 6-speed look mighty attractive.
820	August 29, 2004 1:05PM	jksledson	"My list starting in 1985:

1978 Chevy Monza - first car, shaked uncontrollably over 55mph
1980 Dodge Omni - Always having issues, sold back to dealer.
1978 Chevy Caprice Classic - everyone should inherit their grandmother's V8 once in their lives. Even in the ugly green color, I loved it.
1985 Chevy Cavalier (hatch)- decent reliability to 115K.
1992 Honda Accord DX - first real job, first real car, drove like a dream as a M5.
198-? Dodge Colt - I'm sure it was a deathtrap, but hey, I lost my job and have to give up the Accord. This was another decent performing and reliable vehicle, except for the weird stalling when raining issue.
1990 Mitsubishi Montero - Loved it until the dealer robbed me for a new tranny at 65K for $3500! Could pack a whole studio apartment for a move!
1992 Honda Accord EX - Yes! Bought it at 110K for $6000, sold at 145K for $6500!
(marriage now included...)
1995 Subaru Legacy L Wagon - Should have kept it past 145K, bought that darn Exploder instead. AWD in snow was a dream.
1998 Nissan Pathfinder SE - Bose stereo, sunroof, we both loved it until gas skyrocketed.
2001 Honda Civic LX - gas saver, but too small
2002 Honda Accord SE - just right size. 50K with one minor issue. Compare its resale to my Explorer.
2002 Ford Explorer XLT - Nightmare program vehicle that stabilized over the past year. Live in constant fear of breakdown and continually can't reach an equity level even with a decent initial down payment. This will turn into an Odyssey or Highlander.

And I get the fever once per month that I must replace one or the other... with:
2004 Honda Odyssey
Used SAAB convertible
2004 Subaru Outback
Another used Pathfinder
A Volvo... any model
2004 Toyota Highlander
A Land Rover... just want one
Any beatup pickup... need it once a month...

Please medicate me! The Subaru went 7 yrs, but I get the shakes after 1.5...."
821	August 29, 2004 2:19PM	hammen2	"just not from GM (Webasto).

Bob ""decontent"" Lutz already removed a bunch of stuff from the GTO (climate control, Holden Assist/OnStar, side airbags) to get it to the U.S. at a reasonable price (bless him for at least getting that accomplished). The costs to build the car in Australia and ship it the U.S. aren't cheap. Having said that, the North-American built GTO coming in out '07 or '08 will likely have more options. Besides, the GTO heritage ain't about luxury... it's a ""sleeper car"" with a big motor. You want leather, Nav, sunroof, you're supposed to look at the 'Vette or CTS-V... or the Acura you mentioned. The Acura is not the same kind of car, not playing in the same league, much less ballpark."
822	August 29, 2004 2:33PM	gee35coupe	"But at $30K most people expect a roof and some luxuries. The car is a sales flop so far.
http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/columnists/ch- i-0406020288jun02,0,2129457.column

I mean after you finish romping on the gas pedal you want to open the roof and cruise for a while. At $30K the lack of a roof is a achilles heel.

And an aftermarket roof isn't the answer. They cost you at trade in time. And they look ""aftermarket"" because they all have to have a rigid frame for support."

Just this year I've had a 2004 Explorer XLS Sport V6/4WD (bought new in January, traded a 97 Explorer Limited V8/AWD, wish I hadn't), it was an ok truck, but a major gas hog (14 hwy) and the tranny was goofy.

Traded it for a 2004 Nissan Titan CC SE 4WD (bought new in June). LOVE that truck, but with gas prices and our other truck being a reg cab 99 Ram 3500 V10 (bought used in Nov 03) we bought a 2004 Ford Focus ZX3 (bought new in July) to drive most of the time. I get a kick out of the Focus, very fun little car, but I miss driving my Titan (which is still here just doesn't get driven much).

I'm working fulltime now so will have 120k on the Focus by the time its 2 years old, then I can get what I want for a commuter car. I'm already thinking about what my next car is going to be and the temp tag isn't even off the Focus yet."

825	August 29, 2004 2:52PM	gee35coupe	That's like saying I had a 5 speed Accord that sold quicker than automatics at one dealership. No one knows the specifics of that deal. Generally speaking aftermarket equipment does not add value.
826	August 29, 2004 3:11PM	driftracer	"of aftermarket equipment adding value - it's a matter of whether an aftermarket roof is the kiss of death when compared to a factory sunroof.

To some appraisers, like Terry and I, it matters significantly. Some used car managers don't care, generally because they don't know better."

828	August 29, 2004 3:24PM	gee35coupe	Since you have all that go-fast equipment on board you have reached a point where it would be too expensive to add any of the necessary luxuries that people desire at this price point. I bet the Corvette drivetrain ain't cheap.
829	August 29, 2004 5:39PM	driftracer	"drivetrain, not really. Sure, the LS1 engine is similar, but the transmission is a completely different layout than the 'Vette.

The rear differential, transmission, and driveshaft are very close in design to and could easily be leftovers from the Camaro Z28 and Trans Am."

833	August 29, 2004 6:39PM	driftracer	"trying to keep in it under $35k, I'm assuming - with luxury googaas like a sunroof ($1,000), NAV ($1,500) and others, it would be easy to break out of that price range.

Comparing that car to the Mustang Cobra, Subaru WRX STi, Lancer EVO, and things like that, they're in (pretty much) below $35k.

That is, unless you do the Mytsichrome package on the Cobra (right at $4k) or go nuts with optioning out the STi or EVO with WAY over-rpiced factory options - like over $3,000 for BBS wheels and tires (option on the base WRX) that would cost you $1,300 from the Tire Rack!"
834	August 29, 2004 6:46PM	hammen2	"FYI, I believe that the Webasto sunroof is sold/installed by Holden in Australia on the Monaro. Installed properly (i.e. no leaks), I wouldn't think it would impact the resale value that significantly.

gee35, you're right - some things had to give to get the car here (especially from Australia), and the lux features were it. I expect they'll be at least options on the next-gen. Up here in Cheeseland, a sunroof is useless 6 months out of the year, so it doesn't matter that much to me. Of course, my GTO will probably be garaged for most of those 6 months...

Since the GTO was engineered and assembled in Australia, and is based on an older Opel platform, I'm pretty sure there are extremely few parts in common with the Camaro/Firebird (except for the LS-1).

There are other forums to discuss why the GTO wasn't a sales hit out of the blocks, but they are starting to move now (read in another discussion they're on track to sell 1100-1200 this month - a lot closer to the 18k/yr. they were hoping to sell/produce than the 4500 they've sold so far this year. Of course, putting incentives/financing on the '04's, plus dealers removing the $5k-$10k ADM and allowing test drives, also is helping. The '05 will be higher priced, but offer hood scoops and a new tail, revised brakes, and 400 hp(!). We'll see how THAT car sells, and if the dealerships have learned from their mistakes.

For a car that's not a sales hit and is compared to a Cavalier or Grand Am, it sure turns heads (doing the break-in, I sometimes find myself cruising at the speed limit or slightly below, as I vary the speeds and baby the car). Lots of stares - one kid just about did an ""exorcist"" 360 head spin as he passed me by :-)"
835	August 29, 2004 6:55PM	gee35coupe	"It ain't nothing to write home about. No leather, or anything resembling luxury. It's just as easy to see where the money went on those cars.

As far as the GTO. When I saw the first pics of the car I was all over it. But I HAVE to have a roof in any car like that. If they add one in the future, it would make a great G35 replacement. Speaking of G35, that's another car where they obviously put the money somewhere other than the interior to get the base price below $30k.

If ASC sunfroofs effect resale, I doubt Webasto would be any different. ASC is THE company for roofs."
836	August 29, 2004 6:59PM	driftracer	"all the time - first was with the first Z06 Vette - it came out with 375 hp. people climed all over each other to get one - some people paid $10k over MSRP.

The next year, it had 405 hp, making the first year cars much less desirable, basically shooting those owners in the foot.

Now, this year the GTO has 350 hp. For 2005 it has 400 hp and Ram Air - on the used market, the 2004s will get slammed because of this huge difference."
837	August 29, 2004 7:02PM	kyfdx	The ultimate example was the ZR-1 Corvette.. That was in '91(?), I think.. $25K extra for that model.. even had special tail-lights... A year or two later, they all look just like it, and are within 10-15 horsepower of it... Buyers were paying almost $60K for that car...

839	August 29, 2004 11:36PM	ghulet	...anyone familiar with GM would be smart to avoid a first-year model based on quality issues alone. Yes, I know GTO is essentially a Holden Monaro (sp?), but since those have never been sold or dealt with by any U.S. dealers, it might as well be considered a first-year here. Patience in dealing with GM is always a virtue. Second year out, you get more power, less dealer greed, better service.

843	August 30, 2004 3:22PM	michaellno	"For the past few weeks, my wife has been talking about the Chrysler Pacifica ... how, every time she sees one on the road, how much she likes it. So on Friday night, we decide to take a closer look. Perhaps an '04 AWD, with all the rebates and discounts, could fit into our budget.

The dealer we visited only had one '04 on the lot - black with ebony leather, AWD, and pretty much loaded (nav, sunroof, heated seats, HID, chrome wheels, etc.).

First impression -- it's BIG! Not tall, just substantial, pretty long, too. Nice stance to it. The inside blew the wife away - memory seats, adjustable pedals, reclining (and heated) rear seats.

So, off for a test drive. Power wasn't too bad, said the wife (I disagree, but since it would be her car I wisely decided to keep my mouth shut) - if it has enough go power for her then all is well and good. Nice ride, but the blind spots could be a potential issue. Wife commented (negatively) on the nav - being in the middle of the dash is distracting, she says. Easy to see us taking this car cross-country.

The only reason we didn't buy it that night was the wife thinks the lighter colored interior might be a better match for our animals - we have two dogs, one yellow and the other brown, and the yellow fur particularly shows up on black carpet and is almost impossible to remove.

So, went home and started to search inventory. Found a few, but they were either fully loaded ($38-$40K MSRP) or stripped ($33-$34K MSRP).

Decided, finally, to hold off, and take a look at the Ford Freestyle when it comes out this fall.

So close!"

I have three basic drifts that I am fighting and fussing over:

Flash - cash - and substance

Flash:
used SLK Mercedes Convertible
used BMW Z3 or 323 Convert.
used BMW 323 or 325
Volvo S40
Mustang
Saab 9-2X/Subaru WRX
hold out for Solstice

Cash:
used Saab Convert
Used Saab 9-3 (steel top)
Honda Civic HX Coupe CVT
keep the Elantra
used Jetta TDI

Substance:
Honda Accord
Acura TSX/TL
VW Passat TDI
Suabru Legacy
Infiniti G35
Lexus IS300

of course, all this means some wild swings in costs/capabilities/risk/responsibility.

It is nice to be single, since almost anything from a 2-seat convert to a station wagon will work as a daily driver. Of course, the occasional purchase from Home Depot and Target could be much easier in a wagon...but I have been wanting to survive a convertible for a while now."

846	August 30, 2004 7:40PM	michaellno	"The Pacifica discussion with my wife started me thinking about other potential candidates.

The wife wants (in no particular order):

A. AWD/4WD
B. Some ground clearance - at least, more than a standard ""car""
C. Utility
D. Luxury features - which are unspecific in nature and can change from one car to the next
E. ""Get out of its own way"" performance - measured by the ol' ""butt-ometer"" and not overly specific

What I came up with:

A. Pacifica
B. Freestyle
C. BMW X3
D. Subaru Legacy Outback 2.5XT
E. Volvo V70
F. Audi allroad

Problem is, the wife rejects certain vehicles for what I consider to be the silliest of reasons.

--> The Subaru has ""hard seats"" - she sat in a couple of Subie's at the auto show for less than 30 seconds and made this proclamation.

--> A BMW/Volvo/Audi is too ""pretentious"" - she works for a school district and is sensitive to the perception of what she drives on a ""public"" salary. For instance, the superintendant drives a Subaru (model unknown), while one of the elementary school principals (a peer of sorts) just bought an '04 Saturn VUE AWD V6. The wife and I talked about this on Friday and we simply agree to disagree on the point.

--> She absolutely refuses to drive a minivan, but has no problem with an SUV or ""wagon like"" vehicle.

As the CCB'er in the relationship, every car we have bought or leased - 6 in 8 years - has had my heavy hand of opinion on it in some way or another.

I've promised her this time to be ""hands off"" - this is her car, and I'll have minimal input on it. Basically, if I can fit comfortably behind the wheel, I'll do my best to stay out of the way with regards to style, color, options, etc.

SHUT UP while you still have a chance. Holy cow, how about being nice, she did nothing to you to deserve being attacked. I had a bit of respect for you BEFORE, you seemed nice, now I can't say what I think without getting banned.

Heck, me and hubby have owned 30+ cars in the past 12 years, so what? If someone can afford it what does it matter to you? We currently own 3, plus 3 trailers (popup, 18' car hauler, and a firewood trailer). Oh and YES, we do own our home."

Currently have a fresh solicitation from Mazda to drive anything, and get a $25 dollar Best Buy gift card. Actually good timing, becasue the wife wants a new car, and I want her to look at the MPV.

On the bright side, the car now has 53k miles, although I've had problems with an engine misfire and PCM programming - I've replaced all of the ignition components with MSD stuff, and replaced the PCM (major culprit) with MOPAR's Stage 1 turbo upgrade (includes injectors and a few other small things).

So, she is thinking smaller ... and fully loaded.

Aztek, xB: nope, no way, not in a million years

Element: actually, I kind of like the looks of them, but the wife calls it the ""Duplo Car"" (for those of you who don't know, Duplos are larger versions of Lego blocks).

Saab 9-2x Aero: we test drove a WRX wagon a couple of years ago (before we bought my Saturn). Loved the power, the wife wasn't sold on the looks. She likes the WRX sedan more. Perhaps.

Actually, I'm interested in taking a close look at the Volvo V50 T5, with the 218HP engine. I can tell her it's the same platform as the Focus that we drive (well, updated, of course), AWD, plenty of power and lots of goodies.

The reason for the ground clearance is that she works in a town where not all of the roads are paved, and they can be a bit treacherous in the winter. She almost high-centered the Saturn once last year. Plus, she likes the view of the road from something a bit higher."

She's told me that my Saturn has to be kept at least 2 or 3 years after the payments are done. The Focus will go to our daughter so she'll have something reliable for her college years (she is a HS junior now).

Fine by me - my plan (and hers, too) is to get something with a drop top a few years down the line to have as a fun weekend toy. I'm thinking used Boxster; she prefers the Ford Thunderbird. Hmm; looks like a potential debate when that time comes."

890	August 31, 2004 3:20PM	michaellno	"You know, I talked to her a bit about the X3 -- wasn't aware of the sweet lease deals. Do you know how well loaded they are?

The only downside to the lease is the mileage restriction. I'm guessing the BMW has a 10K/year limit, which is not nearly enough miles. I know I could get more miles put into the lease, but it would bump the cost up. But, a call to the local BMW dealer couldn't hurt, could it?

No, we don't put Jolie numbers on our cars, but the Focus is 9 months old and just turned 13K; we've had the Saturn 21 months and it has just over 33K on it. Our VW that the son drives is almost 6 years old and has just under 70K on it, I think.

I don't dislike the T-bird, just a lot of car for only 2 people. The wife, however, likes her creature comforts. When the time comes, a few years down the road, we'll take a close look at what's out there."

Element: actually, I kind of like the looks of them...

I think the intent there was to say, ""Drop in a few clunkers as her choices, when she says 'yuck' then you come back with your real choice and it suddenly becomes her choice.""

It is a common ploy, like why ""average"" looking people like to go to the bars with ugly people - so they look better. (sad comic joke)

Saab 9-2x Aero: we test drove a WRX wagon a couple of years ago (before we bought my Saturn). Loved the power, the wife wasn't sold on the looks.

OK - now we are talking. Saab's new front fascia has received some rave reviews from the 9-2X board. One thing they did very well was to allow the WRX to ""grow up"" a bit in the transformation. That is the selling point, a more mature WRX for people who don't go to raves and get tattoos...yada, yada.

Actually, I'm interested in taking a close look at the Volvo V50 T5, with the 218HP engine. I can tell her it's the same platform as the Focus that we drive (well, updated, of course), AWD, plenty of power and lots of goodies.

The new V50 is a real nice looking vehicle with lots of power (in T5 form) and I would say it is a better car than the 9-2x for luxury. I think they use the Ford Focus II platform from the European Focus (and current Mazda3)...but a platform is just the starting point. Luckily, it is a good one.

I do need to get out and drive a few cars this weekend. Would be a nice relief.

The reason for the ground clearance is that she works in a town where not all of the roads are paved, and they can be a bit treacherous in the winter. She almost high-centered the Saturn once last year.

Fair enough. I had a heck of a time driving in MN winters in my low-clearance 318ti. A few icy ruts and some bad potholes and it does suddenly make Hummers look reasonable - for about a second.

The Outback would be my choice for your parameters and limitations. The X3 would be great...but I have heard that the ride is very harsh. Something to look for when you test drive one.

Good luck."
899	August 31, 2004 6:13PM	michaellno	"Yep, yep, yep. I see where y'all are going with this. Unfortunately, I'm too much of a car freak to try to distract her with ""clunkers"".

I've been checking out the X3 boards here at Edmunds, plus the BMW website and checking a local dealers inventory - 18 2004 X3's on the lot at the moment. If I can get over the ""prestige"" factor, it looks as if the lease deals being offered are pretty good.

V50 - not sure about the ground clearance, but I really like the looks of them. Will need to check into it further.

9-2x - yeah, a WRX for grown-ups (I'm 40, the wife is 39). I read the review in C&D on the 9-2x but cannot remember if they did anything with the engine management system or turbo plumbing to minimize the on/off feeling at about 3K on the tach. Mind you, it was a blast to drive, just difficult to drive smoothly.

Outback - I've seen quite a number of the redesigned models on the road already, and I really like the looks of them. I'm thinking the Outback 2.5XT Limited with the 5-speed auto. But again, the wife thought the seats were too hard. I'll need to get her back to a Subie lot and try them again.

FYI, we're not in any hurry to pull the trigger:

First, we're waiting for the daughter to get her license. She turned 16 in July but still needs to get her driving hours in before she can take the exam. Here in CO it's 60 hours total, with 10 of them having to be night driving.

Second, she needs to get a job so she can pay for her own gas and insurance. We're thinking that this will happen around Christmas.

So, we've got a few months to test drive and evaluate."

A whopping not-quite 200 miles each way. Not sure which vehicle we're taking, his Blazer has baldish tires and the Check Engine light on, so we may take a roommate's Wrangler or the neighbor's Protege (good choice for comfort and gas mileage).

904	August 31, 2004 11:13PM	andre1969	"I got my bbq tool kit! It was a pretty nice setup for a free giveway, and even came in a plastic case. Plastic, that I might add had a nicer texture than the typical Chevy interior! :-P

Anyway, I drove a gray Magnum SXT. SXT's were all they had... the gray one, a magnesium one, and a silver one that had these $2200 bling bling 20"" rims and tires.

I really liked the car, but it wasn't without its faults. I don't like the transmission at all. At several points during acceleration, it felt like it just disconnected from the car. Now I didn't go stomping it flat-out, because it only had 17 miles on it, but at one point, accelerating onto US 301, it got up to about 40 mph and then seemed to stop and level off at that speed for a second or two, before accelerating further. Maybe you have to really stomp on it though, to get it to shift through the gears more smoothly.

And some things just take getting used to. Like the accelerator pedal; felt like it had too firm of a cable or something, so you had to give it a little gas to get it to move. And don't even get me started on rearward visibility on this thing! Were station wagons that bad back in the day?!

That being said, though, there was a lot to like. This sucker had plenty of legroom...I dunno where they get that 41.8"" figure in the official specs, cuz I fit in this sucker better than I do my Intrepid. In some ways, it almost feels like getting behind the wheel of my '79 NYer than it does any typical modern car. Storage space is excellent, with a big bin in the center console (I liked the flip out cupholder on my Intrepid better than the stationary one here, though), a big glove box, and storage pockets in all 4 doors. My Intrepid only has them in the front doors. And, while I don't smoke, it was still a pleasure to see this car equipped with a cigarette lighter and ash trays! You had to pay something like $19 extra for that in the Intrepid.

The interior definitely has a retro feel to it. The whole dash is big and blocky, and bears a strong resemblance IMO to the dashboards that used to grace plenty of full-sized cars back in the day. And the door panels, with their long, simple, linear designs and full-length armrests, make me think of an old upper-level sedan like a '60's Electra, Ninety Eight, or NYer. Cheaper though, because back in the 60's they hadn't learned how to use that much plastic yet!

And overall the car had a nice, solid, stable feel. Doors had a nice feel when you closed them. If you really tried, you could probably pull the interior apart with your hands, but I have a feeling it would fight back! Nothing shook or rattled, and it's amazing that a car with tires this low-profile can still ride this good!

The one I looked at had a sticker of around $26,400. Sales guy said I could probably get it for $24K. The Magnesium SXT they had was a demo with about 400 miles on it, and had leather. He said I could probably get it for less. Is that a good price for them? I didn't think they'd be marking that much off of them already!

I guess it's a good thing I went down there in my NYer and not my Intrepid, because it would've been awfully tempting to do a trade! Although I really do need to wait until I have the cash flow, and spring for the Hemi! With a sunroof! ;-)"

My first car memory is riding as a three-year old standing up in the front seat of a new 1956 Pontiac (it was 1956 afterall!) with the neighbors who had ""adopted"" me as their own. I went everywhere with them, as I found out later they could not have children, and with two older brothers, well, my parents were most happy to parcel me out! I remember my ""adopted father"" Larry always pointing out new cars and I think he helped me start down the path...

First car my parents owned I remember was 1957 Chevy BelAir pillarless? four-door in a beautiful copper/bronze-like color. I remember helping my Dad clean that car all the time (I was in charge of the whitewall tires!) It was totalled when hit from behind by drunk doing 50 mph while we were sitting at stoplight! We had just returned from my Dad's Navy tour in Hawaii--welcome to the mainland! First night off the ship we were all in the hospital--nothing serious thank goodness.

Replacement car was 1959 Chevy stationwagon in strange brownish color. Dad hated that car, and he bought 1960 Mercury Comet four door right before we were shipped back to Hawaii. Had an AM radio, and a heater! It was a light brown beige-like color.

He traded that car for 1964 Comet right before we shipped back to the mainland. This car, like the other Comet it replaced, had just an AM radio, but because it was bought in Hawaii, had no heater. Upon return to the mainland, we lived in SoCal (Port Hueneme navy base) but visited my brother who was Deputy Sheriff in Lockwood Valley, where it could get very cold, especially when the sun went down. Heater was installed after first visit!

Then came the 1967 Chevy Malibu station wagon. I learned to drive on that car. I had three ""minor accidents"" in that car in first six weeks! Then they bought a 1970 Chevy Nova as a commuter car (living in MD by this time) with 3-speed on the column, AM radio, that's it. This car was a challenge for me as I learned that my left and right feet, coupled with my right arm, just do not work well together! Every car I have owned except one has been an automatic because of this. I will post my list IF accepted into this most prestigious forum."

908	September 1, 2004 9:00PM	bryan	"My first car was 1972 Chevy Nova, I bought new in April 1972. It was beautiful bronze metallic with beige vinyl roof with the sliding sunroof that was only available that year IIRC--leaked like a sieve! Had small V8 (307?), and would it go. However, really wanted a convertible, so in August 1972...

Mom bought the Nova, and I bought a 72 Malibu convertible (red over black, 307V8, auto, ps, pb, AM radio w/rear speaker!). Loved this car, but saw 1974 Buick Regal on the road, so Dad bought the Malibu and I ordered a Regal from the factory February of 74 with every option (including seat belt upgrade to get color that matched the interior!). That car was just beautiful, but was POS mechanically. So...

Traded that car year later March 75 on 1975 Caprice Classic Convertible off the showroom floor. Gorgeous car--white on white with red dash, carpet--loaded with every option. White top was difficult to keep clean, so...

Traded that car in May 1977 for 1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass. Had contracted to purchase 1977 Gold Cutlass Supreme Brougham, but when I went to pick it up after the new car was cleaned up and ready, saw the Salon parked next to the one I had bought and cancelled the Brougham and bought the Salon instead! White over burgundy with burgundy vinyl roof. Beautiful car, and never had a problem except the clock in the passenger side dashboard could not keep time. So...

Traded that car in June 1978 for 1978 Pontiac Grand Prix, burgundy over beige cloth. Great car, absolutely beautiful, but gas prices were going up, and first time I had to pay $20 to fill up, well--sold it to good friend and bought...

In March, 1981, new Datsun 200SX. Blue over blue. Paid way too much, and stupidly bought five-speed (forgot earlier experience with feet and arm). Great car on the highway once I grinded through the gears to 5th, but, I burnt out clutch in two years, so...

Dad retires and gives me back the 1972 Malibu convertible. It's now painted Earl Schibe bronze (ugh!) Still runs well, and the interior is as immaculate as the day car was bought new! Becomes my weekend fun car.

In March 1984, bought used 1983 Oldsmobile 98 four door Regency Brougham. Triple medium/dark blue. Beautiful car, but soon learned why it was traded in first time by original owner, so...

In August 1985, I bought new 1985 Pontiac Parisienne Brougham, triple burgundy. Spent lots of time on the bus or catching rides getting to work while that car visited the Pontiac dealer, so...

In June 1987, bought 1987 Pontiac Bonneville, grey over grey. Great car, kept it the longest of any car up to this point, but got the fever for a new convertible, sold the Malibu to a neighbor in its ugly bronze state for $2K and the Bonneville to a good friend, so...

In March 1991, bought new Chevy Camaro RS Convertible, Teal over grey leather. Every option except CD player. Bought this car over the telephone! Great car, kept this car until I started having lower back issues, finally realized that this car was exascerbating the pain so I sold it to a good friend, and...

In April 1996, bought 1996 Oldsmobile LSS. Beige over beige leather with every option except sun/moon roof, which dealer had installed at my request. This sun/moonroof has NEVER leaked and has features that were not available on factory roof--auto closing feature is one. Best automobile bar none I have ever owned. Not ONE problem for first five years--nothing! Still have this car and it now has 90K miles. Because I am fastidious about regular maintenance and cleaning my cars, it looks almost new today. Still get compliments.

Not happy without a convertible, in 1998 I bought a used 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Convertible; first time I owned two ""regular driver"" cars at the same time. Teal over beige leather with 22.5K miles and according to some paperwork left in the car, a Doctor had leased it. Reeked of cigarette smoke, but had to have the car. Car spent many sunny days sitting in the driveway with the top down to rid it of the smoke smell, but it worked. Kept this car until this past May, when...

I traded it and bought #363 of the final 500 Collectors Edition Oldsmobile Alero. Awesome car so far. Still two cars, right? Well, I missed one purchase...

Missing in here is the 2003 Oldsmobile Aurora I bought over the internet from a dealership in Delaware on February 28, 2003 (last day of 0% 60 month financing). Drove through snow and ice from VA to get the paperwork done. Bordeaux Red over beige leather. All options except CD changer. Even has the gold package, which looks good on this color. Got the extended warranty to 5 years/60K miles at no extra charge. Good thing, as this car has had several warranty issues, none mechanical in nature thank goodness, all of which have been handled in an outstanding manner by Delaware Olds/Chevy/Pontiac dealer.

Most recent purchase was 2004 Pontiac Bonneville GXP I bought one week after the Alero! I literally ""stole"" this car with the discount and rebates and GM certificate I had. Bought from the Delaware GM dealer. One warranty issue has been sunroof rattle--fixed to perfection on first try. Car is absolute blast to drive--graystone over gray two-tone leather--every option except CD changer. Will never have another car without XM satellite radio! Now I have four cars! My insurance guy just loves me.

Please forgive me for the lengthy post--but I love cars. Like others, I am already plotting my next car, most likely a Cadillac in 2006, but have to pay off one of the most recent purchases first! Thank goodness I bought my house in 1977!"

I find it interesting that you have stuck with big US steel all the way through (except the Datsun). Safe to say you either grew up in Michigan or just hate Japanese and German cars in general. Not a single VW, Saab, Volvo, or even a Honda/Toyota in the bunch, even with all the reliability issues you had.

(So help me, if you say ""one"" then I'm gonna ... I'm gonna ... well, I'm gonna congratulate you on single handedly keeping the American industrial base alive and well)

Welcome!

PS is the Alero a 2 door or a 4 door? I'm trying to figure out your rationale for having 2 (or 3?)large domestic sedans in your driveway/garage/car port."
914	September 1, 2004 9:29PM	bryan	"Knowing what I know now, I would have tried to keep a few of them (the Malibu and the Caprice for sure). When my neighbor resold the Malibu, he had had it repainted to its original factory red, and sold it for $6K. Nothing else was done except a new carborator (sp?) and other minor mechanicals. Car had 80K when I sold it, he resold it after putting on additional 40K!

Sometime I fantasize about the cars I considered and didn't buy, like the 55 original immaculate TBird for $5K in 1975!"
915	September 1, 2004 9:31PM	anonymousposts	3 cars for one driver is not that bad. We have 4 cars for 2 drivers. At on point we had 5 cars for 2 drivers (this was about 6 years ago).
916	September 1, 2004 9:38PM	bryan	"The Alero is four-door--the only way the final 500 were configured. All are Dark Cherry Metallic over beige leather, GLS trim level. I am the primary driver on all four vehicles I own (96 LSS, 03 Aurora, 04 Alero and 04 Bonny GXP). My 66-year old uncle lives with me and he drives the LSS and the Alero whenever he wants. He's afraid of the Aurora and the Bonneville (too much power with those Northstar V8s he says).

As I tell my parents, who think I am certifiable, I am doing my best single-handedly to keep this economy going. Plus, I must say, I have become a savvy car buyer since the Camaro--I understand dealerships have to make money to stay in business, but I do my research and homework like most here in the Edmund's forums. I have tried to maximize rebate and financing incentives to my best benefit. I have yet to leave the dealership with regrets, even when I knew I could have saved a few more $$$. Life to me is too short to sweat the small stuff. As several others have said ""Buy and drive what you like"". I have."
917	September 1, 2004 10:01PM	bryan	Appreciate your kind words. Your posts are one of my favorites. I can picture most of the cars you describe, as I am a domestic car guy too. I too thought the Chrysler/Dodge Cordoba/Magnum body style from late seventies/early eighties were almost perfection. Style over substance was my mantra in some of my purchases, which I, rather than regret, just got rid of. Took me a while to figure out why I always had a car payment! Still didn't help once I knew--now I just have more than one payment!

919	September 1, 2004 10:35PM	andre1969	I had an Olds Alero coupe for a rental for a short business trip I took to California. It was the 2.4 OHC 4-cyl, and I thought it was a hoot to drive! I normally have trouble saying this about GM cars, but I actually liked the interior of this one! Maybe it was the color scheme: a bright green exterior with a beige interior, but I thought it was really tasteful. I've never been a fan of the Malibu or the Grand Am, but I always had a soft spot for the Alero.

922	September 1, 2004 11:17PM	akangl	"Let's see if I can remember his cars:

First car was a 1965 Ford Fairlane (his baby) bought in 1983 I believe, was totalled a few years later.

Next was a 67? Pontiac Lemans after the Fairlane, not sure when it was sold.

Then he had a 1985? Ford Tempo bought used in 87 I think. Traded that for a 1988 Ford F-150 bought new in May of 1988.

Traded the F-150 in May of 1997 (OMG 9 years!!!) for a used 1992 Ford F-250 (needed 4WD).

Sold the F-250 (that was so stupid, was a great truck) in November of 1999.

Bought a 1996 GMC Sierra K2500 diesel (ok truck, but no F-250) in November of 1999.

Traded the Sierra in February of 2002 for a used 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 (horrible awful transmission eating truck).

Traded the Ram in April of 2002 for a new 2002 Dodge Ram 2500 V10 (good truck, same long story as the Jeep, was gone by November of 2002).

Bought a 1994 Chevy K3500 diesel in June 2003 (that was the WORST decision we EVER made, spent $7k in a year keeping it running)

Bought a 1999 Dodge Ram 3500 V10 in November 2003 (good truck, works hard).

The 94 K3500 was traded in June of 2004 on my 2004 Titan, we were NEVER happier to see a truck go.

Starting in 1995
1989 Ford Probe (my first car)
1982 Toyota Tercel (my now husband's commuter)
1991 Toyota MR2 Turbo

That's how it started ... then in 1996 ....

Traded the 82 Tercel for ..
1987 Toyota Celica GTS

Then traded the 91 MR2 for ...
1993 Acura Vigor GS

Then traded the 87 Celica for ..
1997 Toyota RAV4 2 door

Sold the Probe and gee bought ...
1987 Toyota Corolla FX16 GTS

So we now have the 97 RAV4, 93 Vigor, and the Corolla FX16. The RAV4 is a lease and we want a car to keep the miles down so we buy ...

1990 Acura Integra LS hatchback

Then we want to upgrade so we sell the 90 Acura Integra and buy a ..

1994 Acura Integra LS hatchback

Gee finds a 1989 Tercel at a junkyard that's ""caling his name"" so he buys it, puts an engine in it, still runs like crap, so he trades it for ...

1988 Corolla FX16 GTS

He then sells his 1987 Corolla to a pizza guy (who is still driving it BTW)

So we now have the 97 RAV4, 94 Integra, 93 Vigor, and 1988 Corolla FX16 GTS.

We decide we no longer need the 94 Integra so we sell it and then ....

Gee finds a 89 Civic wagon with a brick through the window and a broken timing belt that's ... you got it ... ""calling his name"". We buy it for $800. Fix the windshield and the belt. Car takes us to Canada, VA, Ohio, FL, and Ohio again.

Then my sister needs a car so we sell her the Civic wagon. This is late 1998 and we have the 97 RAV4, 93 Vigor, and 1988 Corolla.

Then I start my job at the car dealer.

The Vigor never gets driven so we trade it for a ..

1998 Honda Civic EX. Notice something odd about the rear trim underneath the tail light so Honda helps us get out of it and we buy a ...

1999 Honda Accord EX .. this is now Jan. 1999.

In the meantime the head gasket in the 88 Corolla is starting to leak so gee sells it and buys a ..

1991 Acura Integra LS in burgundy

Then he finds a blue ...

1992 Acura Integra LS that ""calls his name"" a little louder than the burgundy one.

The he finds a 1991 Nissan 300ZX TT for cheap so he buys it.

So we now have the 99 Accord EX, 92 Integra, and the 91 300ZX.

Then he doesn't think he is mature enough for the 300ZX so he sells it and buys a ...

2000 Chevy Silverado (biggest pile of gas-guzzling pretty junk we have owned)

Then he finds another car that ""calls his name"" so he dumps his 92 Integra for ...

1993 Honda Civic EX coupe.

We are now in late September 2000 with the Accord, Silverado, and Civic. The freshened 01 Accords come out and the coupe sure is sweet so I buy a ...

2001 Honda Accord EX V6 coupe in black with black leather and some nice 17"" Konigs Tantrums thank you very much (this was one of my favorite cars to look at but I hated the tranny).

Then Gee realizes the truck just isn't worth it so he trades the Silverado and buys a ..

1994 Lexus LS400 (this is March 2001 and we still own this car believe it or not)

We find a nice 1991 Accord EX 5-speed that needs a good home so we buy it as a fourth car.

Then we decide that as pretty as my coupe is we just don't like the indecisiveness of the tranny so we sell the 01 coupe and buy a ..

1993 Honda Accord EX 5-speed.

That makes the 91 kind of redundant so we sell the 91 Accord in the mean time.

We now have the 94 LS400, 93 Accord, and 93 Civic. If we still had these cars we would be friggin rich by now.

But us being us we decide we want a new car again. I am ready for something non-Honda so we buy a ...

2001 Mazda Protege ES. Loved the car till we took it on a road trip and realized what a dog the engine really is at higher speeds so we drop it at the first opportunity.

The first opportunity turns out to be a 2000 Honda Civic Si. Boy is this car a screamer. Then we come across a ...

2000 Honda Civic Si .. this time in Electric Blue Pearl ... so we buy it with the intent of me driving the blue one and selling my black one. BUT I can tell from gee's face as we drive the blue one home that I will be lucky to see the driver's seat again. So he sells his 93 Civic and we keep both 2000 Si's.

We are now in summer 2002 and have the Lexus and the two Civic Si's. Well gee sees a lowered 02 Si hatchback on a website and wants to go take a look at one. We go to ""look"" and end up with a ..

2002 Honda Civic Si hatchback in white. Got the car for $1500 off invoice and got $2200 more than we paid for the black 2000 Si.

Some twit turns out in front of me in a Grand Am and totals the Si. So we buy a ...

2002 Honda Civic Si hatchback in white.

Then the 03 Accord coupes come out and Gee just HAS to have one because they ""call his name"". So we buy a ...

2003 Honda Accord EX-L coupe

So we now have the 03 Accord, the 94 LS400, and the 02 Civic Si.

Well gee comes across a 95 Lexus GS300 Touring that, believe it or not, is ""calling his name"". So he decides that since I want his 03 Accord coupe anyways and the 02 Si seems to be cursed (new windshield, rolls down hill twice into mailbox the first time and construction area the second, and gets hit by a shopping cart at the grocery store in a 6-month time span)he will give me the Accord coupe and we trade the 02 Si for the 95 GS300.

Then we move to a larger house with a larger yard and we decide we need a truck. We find a good deal on a ...

1997 Dodge Dakota Club Cab 5-speed

So we now have the Dakota, the GS300, the Accord coupe and the LS400. Then we find out we are about to have a little gee and anony so ...

Time to rethink our driveway. I COULD drive the GS but we don't think it's large or safe enough and the gas mileage stinks. Since we know we are going to have to get rid of the Accord anyways and even though we look at other options we still like the Accord more than anything we buy a ...

2004 Honda Accord EX-L sedan

So since we never drive the truck anyways (so much for that idea) and the GS guzzles gas and has never seemed to drive the same since gee cleaned the engine with a water hose .. gee trades the truck and buys a ...

2003 Honda Civic Si in Vivid Blue Pearl .. yes this is just like the 2 white Si's we had, no we're not crazy .. OK yes we are but still ...

Then we sell the GS300 so we are left with ...

94 LS400, 2004 Accord, and 03 Si.

Well the baby comes and suddenly the Accord doesn't have as much room as we though it did and getting the baby in and out of the Si is a royal pain so we see the great lease deals offered and buy a ...

2004 Odyssey EX-RES. It's only a 24 month lease which should get us through the time where we need to carry the most stuff with Little Gee."
925	September 2, 2004 12:15AM	anonymousposts	"Uh oh, we both start to wish we had bought the Accord in a manual because it doesn't seem like it will make that much of a difference. But it's silly to trade it this soon so we decide to keep it then ... Honda issues the recall on the V6 automatics and that's all the excuse we need to dump it.

First we bought a ...

1997 Honda Civic LX .. good idea due to price and gas mileage but it's kind of slow and no where near as nice as our 04 EX-L was (what did we expect for $3500 though) and the manual transmission is making funny noises and movements. So we return the Civic and buy a ....

2004 Honda Accord EX-L. This time red and this time it's a manual.

So that's how we got to where we are today which is:

1994 LS400 (owned since March 2001)
2003 Honda Civic Si (owned since October 2003)
2004 Honda Odyssey EX RES (owned since May 2004)
2004 Accord EX-L (owned since July 2004)

That's how you end up with 36 cars since 1995 and that's how you become a CCB professional."
926	September 2, 2004 12:33AM	ghulet	Either that, or you have mid-six-figure incomes and a hell of a lot of time on your hands to buy cars. I thought my thirteen or so cars in my nineteen years of driving was a bit excessive. I tend to buy badly used beaters, and usually end up keeping them six months to a year, eventually giving up after 'taking a bath' on most of them. I will say, the best car I've owned thus far would be my '90 Mazda Protege LX 5-speed (stolen, replaced with an '89 VW Golf), with my '77 Chevy Caprice a very close second.

I feel my list is inadequate, and I'm definitely not a CCB'er, but here goes:
Got my license in 1998, had local Pontiac dealer procure a 1997 Grand Am GT coupe. It was a nice first car *but* I learned to drive on Mom's 1995 Volvo 960 (super nice car, wish it was still in the family), so I traded it in 1999 for a 1999 VW Jetta GLS VR6. The Jetta had the typical VW problems, and expensive repairs, but I loved that car. Purchased a 2002 Nissan Altima 2.5s in fall 2003, sold the Jetta shortly thereafter.

I never had a wreck until I bought the Nissan. The Nissan is still my daily driver, I bought a 2004 BMW 325i and returned it a week later because, after five or ten tries, the dealer couldn't get the paperwork right. Some kook backed into it in the lot outside my apartment the night before I turned it in. That plus the other three wrecks (none my fault) and speeding ticket (okay, my fault) I got in the past six months... Let's just say I have really bad luck with cars lately (after a run of about five years with decent luck)... Did you know in Great Britain, you can register a tank and drive it on the roadway? I'd be all over that if we could do it here!

So, do I qualify for probational membership? Once I get my law degree, maybe I will be able to join the platinum club!"

Only thing with the Focus is they don't have an SDF filter for it, so I'll still have to change the filter every 5k. The other two they have filters for and the Dodge had Amsoil in it until the oil pump went and the dealer drained it.

I drive the Focus about 1000 miles/week back and forth to work. Its a good little car, but it ain't no Jetta 1.8T."
932	September 2, 2004 3:35PM	nippononly	"five new cars in my life - all bought in the last decade - but despite two being Toyotas and one being my current RSX, my favorite of the five was my Subaru OBS, which I kept five whole years - truly a record for me. Since then, the two Toyotas (a Celica and a Matrix) came and went in two years combined, and the RSX now has about six months. This may turn into my favorite of the group if I can still my roving eye for a few years.

Of all the multitudes of used cars I have had, my overall favorite has to be my 1988 Mazda RX-7. There is just nothing quite like a rotary, and if it hadn't been for shockingly poor gas mileage (for such a small car), highly time-consuming maintenance, and constant emissions difficulties, it probably would have become my all-time fleet champ in terms of how long I kept it.

Drove it until 1994, and traded it to get a CD player in car #2, a 1994 Nissan 300ZX Convertible. Leased it new for 3 years, then bought it off of lease. Used for a daily driver until September 2002, when I bought #3, a 1999.5 Pathfinder. So Pathy is now the daily driver and the Z only comes out on the sunny days.

That's three cars in 17 years, and I still have two of them. But I can't count the number of cars that I've wanted to own in that amount of time. Hundreds."

944	September 3, 2004 9:31PM	ghulet	...based on the prices for the new TL and the old RL, I'm guessing these will push $50k fully loaded. A bit dear for most of us, no?
945	September 3, 2004 9:37PM	anonymousposts	$50,000 financed for 60 months at 4% is $900 per month. Yeah it's alot but I'm sure some people who have 2 (or 4) decent cars that they financed are close to that $900 mark as well. So you can buy one RL and drive a clunker every day or 2-3 decent cars but no RL. And not to mention the RL can be leased which may help out the monthly payment.

Looks like the Titan is going to spend its winter under a car cover, can't find winter tires in an 18"" and to drop down to 17s even with cheap alloys or steel wheels is going to run me $2k.

960	September 5, 2004 3:39AM	tornado25	"Well, it looks like it's put up or shut up for me start cracking on the CCB membership.

Right now, my sister drives my car to her 60 mi RT daily commute. I walk the 6 blocks or so to work. However, I recently resigned and will be done on 9/15. I will need a vehicle if I want to look for jobs and such and my sister can't walk 30 miles to work. Much less 30 miles back (ha).

So I've begun the search for vehicles, focusing on the Steiner philosophy (Prizms, Corolla, Proteges, etc). I'm very torn--I could spend $1000 on a beater that gets me around, but chances are it'll die, cost more to fix than I paid and I start looking for a $1000 ride again. Not good, IMO. Plus, I wouldn't think of taking it out of town. So, I considered spending up to $5000 on a quality, if boring, car that I could sort of pound away on and once a new job comes along, buy what I want.

So here's cars I want/sort of look at/could have all at the same time:

Cadillac Catera: found 97 w/ 83k mi on the internet asking 6,200, which is probably worth my 5000 ""limit"". I know it's been deadpanned, but I've always sort of liked it.

Chrysler 300M. In love with the car since introduction. The only models that come CLOSE to my limit are 99s or 00s with WAAAAY high miles. No thanks, I think.

Olds Intrigue/Aurora/Alero. Depending on my mood, I've liked all these cars. For what you spend on the Intrigue, though, you could find a nice Aurora. The Alero, I've always kind of liked as nicer Grand Am-ish type car.

I have found 3000ish Proteges and Sentras and may consider them. The thing is, I owned a Neon and have a Sunfire now. I'm not sure I want another 4 cyl buzzy little car.

So...strangely, I found myself on a local lot Friday night and found a 99 Buick Century (I know! Shut up.) with 91k mi. It's listed for 4900, but the sales guy and I know each other very well, I think I could at least get it down to 5000 OTD. On one hand, it's a Century. Enough said. OTOH, it's a nice, comfortable car with a V6 (never owned a V6--oh wait, had a 94 Acclaim with an engine they called a V6--I never noticed since the tranny refused to use any of the cylinders), lots of nice comfort features. It be a good car to get around in for a while.

I think I might just use the off time to cruise lots in Green Bay. Good deals on cars have way of just showing up. Plus, it can't hurt to offer 5k for the Catera! Maybe it's been for sale forever..."
961	September 5, 2004 4:26AM	corvette	"I've always heard bad things about the dependability, especially the earlier years. Four-cylinder cars aren't always buzzy. The 2.5 in my Altima is a little raucous, but I bet a Corolla (1.8?) has less rotational mass and thus less things to resonate. Don't know specifics on the cars you're looking at, though.

If you kind of like the Century, you might try a Lumina. Equally uninspiring but a little more road feel, plus they also seem to hold up well mechanically. I think the 3.8 and 3.4 GM motors have more headgasket/intake manifold issues than the 3.1.

Whatever you decide, I don't think you'll hear anyone here advise you not to pony up and buy another car. No excuses needed!"
962	September 5, 2004 5:07AM	anonymousposts	"my sister is in need of a cheap car and this is what I have found ...

1998 Saturn SL2

I am going to pick it up for $1800. Not a bad price. Carfax is clean, no evidence of paintwork, and it runs pretty well. Kind of buzzy but that is a Saturn characteristic."
963	September 5, 2004 1:26PM	driftracer	RUN away from that Catera! I've done bunches of cases on them, and they have HORIIBLE electrical and engine management systems. Even the CTS that replaced it isn't much better.
964	September 5, 2004 2:42PM	hammen2	"The CTS which replaced the Catera, isn't on the same chassis/platform (built on the new Sigma platform in the new Grand River plant in Lansing). I've periodically read the CTS forum here on Edmunds and not seen many complaints. The first year CTSes, and all stick models up to '05, have an Opel 3.2L engine which is a relative to the one in the Catera which was problematic).

In addition to the GTO, I also own a '98 Aurora. Build quality and problems are hit-and-miss - mine has had several issues that others on Edmunds have experienced (AC compressor, Northstar rear engine seals failing, multifunction switch failure), while my mother-in-law's '98 has been gas, oil, and tires. I'm lucky in that I purchased an extended warranty which is still alive and has paid out much more than its cost.

I generally wouldn't recommend a luxury car if you're sensitive to expensive repairs (unless you're a good shadetree mechanic and have a parts connection somewhere). Someone recommended a Lumina - I had a '96 LS (3.1L) for almost six years, and it was a very reliable car, if not a ""driver's car"" - kinda like an appliance car. The '95 through 2000 bodystyle is the more reliable one (and I'd avoid the first model year on general principle). and 2000 was fleet-only. The LTZ (loaded-up models) had the 3.4L ""Dual Twin Cam"" model for the first couple years, then they put the 3800 in, which may or may not have head gasket issues. I had the 3.1 (160 hp) and it never gave me any grief through 70+k miles (my wife's aunt in Michigan is driving it now, has over 100k and has been ultra-reliable, though the body is starting to rust out (rear quarter panels)). The interior (my LS was a rare model with ""leather"") is reasonably decent for a mid-90's GM product (had a rental Impala once and though the Lumina was better).

Good luck with whatever you decide,

I grumbled about the manual tranny when we bought the car, but hubby wanted to save money and not buy the automatic. I've never been one to drive a manual for very long, the Focus is only the 5th car we've ever bought with a manual tranny (and the longest lived was only 10 months).

Drift, thanks for the heads-up. I trust your experience and your job gives me an excellent insight.

The thing about the Century is that it indeed is simply an appliance. I just want something to run around in. So maybe the $3000 Sentra/Protege isn't a bad idea. I'm still considering getting a small pickup, too. Around here, they have a lot of utility. I've already got a car (that I don't use, but I DO pay for), so it might be nice to have something else.

I'm just thinking once the job is done, I'll just drive around looking at car lots all day. It'll be a fun little treasure hunt...hmm, but I gotta find somebody's car to use first."

I loved it at the time, but then we had a cool manager. I didn't start off there, but in the summer of '92 they tried a little downsizing, and my position in Mens accessories got cut. So I got put on the 3rd floor of the children's dept. I thought I was going to hate it, as there wasn't much else up there...childrens, lingerie, dresses, etc. But it ended up being pretty cool. And I was the only man working the 3rd floor, which kinda had its advantages ;-)

She hardly ever went home, often working from 4-5 in the morning until 9-10 at night, sometimes sleeping at work because her husband's schedule conflicted with hers - she was always talking about getting a NICER truck, paying the house off early, etc, since they have no kids.

They wanted to pay off the trucks and the house before having children...

She worked too hard, and at 34, she had a massive stroke.

I don't have to work tonight or tomorrow, my feet are loving the time off.

I test drove a Vibe back in January and yup, its a dog, about as much of a dog as my Focus.

After the accident I saw last night I'm having major second thoughts about driving a small car and am seriously thinking about using the Titan to commute. Had I left at my regular time (I was pokey and left 30 mins late) it would have probably been me involved and I highly doubt I'd be here to talk about it.

Was a 3/4T Chevy reg cab truck, just came off the Dalton hwy (telltale dirt), looked like he'd been hunting. He hit a cow moose, hard. Mangled the truck, the roof was nearly at the back window. Very scary, made me think long and hard about what I drive."

If I do that I'm going to have a light bar put on the car and 4 offroad lights on it, 2 pointed forward and 2 pointed to the sides. Then maybe I can see the hairy things before they jump out at me.

In all seriousness driving a truck doesn't necessarily mean you will live. A friend of mine was headed to her summer cabin with her boyfriend (he was driving), she took off her seatbelt for just a moment to turn around and get something, at that moment a moose jumped out in front of them. He couldn't miss it, it hit the pass side of the truck, the truck rolled, Judy was thrown and the truck landed on her. She was killed. The truck was a 2003 Chevy Tahoe.

Another friend was driving her Lincoln Continental and hit a moose, she lived, but is a quadraplegic.

It all rolls down to HOW you hit the moose, I know with the Focus if it was inevitable I would aim the pass side of the car at it and hope."
1006	September 8, 2004 3:09PM	driftracer	we don't have moose (meese?) in Texas or PA, and I've never seen one in NY or NJ. I'm thinking that they were there before we were, so it's either drive a D-8 Cat Dozer to work or move to the Lower 48...

http://www.napsnet.com/auto/61516.html

""As for the new technologies for improved safety protection, many have been explored in the world's most sophisticated indoor car-to-car crash test facility. The facility, owned by Honda, is made to aid research of vehicle-to-vehicle collisions and explore ""real world"" crash safety. The research conducted at Honda's state-of-the-art crash research center led to the development of a new body design called Advanced Compatibility Engineering body structure. Three key points of the ACE structure:

1. Crash forces are distributed over a wider area.

2. The possibility of a misalignment with other vehicles, such as with pickups that have a higher bumper, are significantly reduced.

3. Highly efficient energy absorption is provided by polygonal-shaped mainframe members with greater load-bearing capacity."""

My little Focus weighs in at about 2600 lbs.......hardly a match for a moose. I did see an Echo that hit a caribou (about 500 lbs), totalled the car, was an interesting mess."
1011	September 8, 2004 4:20PM	harlequin1971	"wow...you are a CCB if ever there was one.

it's all good.

funny, didn't you buy the Focus as reasonable transport to and from work? Now, it is the cause of frustration and you wish you hadn't bought it...mostly because it is a pain to drive (manual) and you don't feel safe enough in a small, economical car?

Am I keeping up on this one?

Sounds a little like me:

I was driving around in my cute little BMW 318ti, manual. The stick had been a big hassle when I used to commute to and fro for work, but became much less of a hassle when I started working from home...

I had decided to enroll and go back to school (opportunities were not popping out at me, given the sluggish economy) for my master's. Well, time to get a cheap ride with a good warranty and high economy. I bought an Elantra GT. I wanted an auto, but after driving both, the manual was just too much more satisfying to drive.

Then, three months later, I get recruited into my current job. The money was enough to put school on hold for now. I go from working out of my house to a 35mile RT that takes me through the #3 worst highway section in America (the Stack in Phoenix).

So, while I finish up the papers on my new condo, I have been dreaming about what I can do to change wheels. I want a smooth auto, or a much more powerful manual. I like my car just fine...but if I am gonna work and spend an hour in my car everyday, I want something with a nicer stereo and more ooomph from the engine.

I have a laundry list of choices, from dreams to frugal replacement killers. But I am also trying real hard to tell myself the ""two years"" mantra. (No helpful spouses to fill that role for me.) I may be changing jobs, and who knows what that might bring.

But it is hard. Jaguar is deeply discounting the X-Type. I always wanted a nice luxury convertible and Mercedes SLK/BMW 3-series converts are within reach on the used market. The new Acura TL is lovely, as is the Volvo S40. There is always the Jetta/Passat or the Mazda 3. Maybe an RX8 or G35 Coupe...

Arghhh.

I need more friends in AZ, so I can take them car shopping and cool my triggers."
1012	September 8, 2004 4:26PM	akangl	"We bought the Focus before I started working. We bought it to offset the miles on the Titan and to commute to our fishing hole 2-3 times/week (400 mile round trip). Also to just have a 3rd vehicle (which has proved to be wonderful especially when hubby's Ram was down for 2 weeks) and have a cheap car to run to town with (town is 90 miles away).

Then I started thinking, well maybe I should go back to work since we have this cheap car to drive. So I did. I grumble about the car, but I won't get rid of it, nope, won't allow my CCB urges to overtake me. Haven't even looked at a new car since I bought the Focus.

Have had the car for 6 weeks, it turned 6k yesterday. The Titan will be 3 months old on Saturday and will turn 10k sometime this week.

I like it, I just grumble about the manual trans and the size of the car. Gotta have something to grumble about. However, I do have to say that the seats in the Focus are MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH more comfortable then the Titan. I noticed that big time yesterday after driving the Focus a lot and not driving the Titan for quite a while."

You would not have belived the amount of damage.

Trying to avoid hitting a moose or deer can be even worse. The police often arrive at an accident scene where a car has swerved off the road and hit a tree killing the occupants.

In these cases, they automatically assume the driver tried to avoid an animal.

Jolie, I don't know how you do it. Be careful!"

Speaking of moose, hubby went out logging yesterday and saw 3 bulls, he killed one. Thing was so big we gave 1/2 of it away to his logging buddy. My Titan has the other 1/2 in it, I had to go up and pick up the meat and antlers since hubby had a full load of firewood and didn't want to dump it.

I'm off to the processor today to drop it off, then come home, sleep, and go back to town for work tonight. Will swing the Titan by a car wash place and spray out the bed after I drop the meat off, its a mess in there."
1021	September 9, 2004 3:26PM	driftracer	freezing weather! You don't have to be in such a hurry to get the animal to processing. In Montana, in fall of 1990, we had half an elk in the truck for two days! It was 15-20 degrees at night and 30-32 during the day - no worries!

What bothers me is my clutch foot (well, ankle, really) after more than an hour or so behind the wheel. Don't know if it's my legs or the angle of the pedal, but it gets sore after a while."
1027	September 9, 2004 10:30PM	nippononly	"the term ""buzzy"" usually referred to the engine? In which case, the highway would not have that much to do with it. My Matrix (Corolla powertrain)I had before was ""buzzy"" once you got the revs up over 4K, that is for sure...."
1028	September 9, 2004 11:52PM	anonymousposts	The Saturn is only buzzy when idling or when the revs get too high. It is so buzzy when you are stopped at a light that you can barely see through the side mirrors because there is so much vibration. For normal driving between 20-70 though it's a great car. I actually like it better than the 97 Civic we had for 5 days but the Civic had other issues. It should serve my sister well for the time she will have it.
1029	September 9, 2004 11:53PM	akangl	I guess I notice the buzziness of the Focus more since I also drive the Titan which is super quiet (well, maybe a little growly). Just the difference between a V8 and a 4-cyl I guess.
1030	September 9, 2004 11:56PM	anonymousposts	Well my Accord 4 cylinder and our Si are smooth as glass regardless of speed. You can be doing 120 in the Accord and barely notice it. Not that I have done it ... in this one at least. But I have been up to 100 MPH and the car is still quiet and rock solid. The Si revs high on the highway but due to the balance shafts it is extremely smooth. If you don't look at the tach you would never know how how the revs are.

I can't get excited about Toyotas. The interior in the Camry turns me off as does the exhaust that hangs down underneath the car (this problem extends to the 97-01's and the ES300. Toyota builds decent trucks but I am not a truck person. The Sienna is OK but I would rather have a 2004 or a 2005 Odyssey. The Corolla is a nice small car but the driving position sucks for me and is intolerable for Gee. Also has a rear axle."

It doesn't get loud, it is TOTALLY smooth, and even at redline it feels like it wants more. That is the one thing I truly love about Honda (well that and the transmissions - also super sweet). It is in a class of one on this count.

Apart from that I am with Mathias - Toyota builds better bodies and paints them better, also gives them better switches and electronics so that when they are old they still work, and don't stick or break."
1034	September 10, 2004 6:03PM	harlequin1971	"look better than Toyotas.

It is a narrow margin, but Honda has always managed a more sporting appeal for the masses than Toyota.

I can't get past the notion that with a few minor exceptions, Toyota is the Buick of the Japanese automakers...luxurious, well-built rides that disconnect you from the driving experience. I have found Hondas to be a bit more engaging and stylish for the young buyer's eye...sales figures bears this out as well."
1035	September 11, 2004 1:14AM	anonymousposts	"I think Honda electronics are on par with Toyota's. In all the Honda's I have owned (including ""beaters"" bought with 120,000 miles plus) the power switches and other misc. buttons and knobs have always worked. Also, the sunroofs in Honda don't seem to leak even as they get older. I think the only exception is the ventilation knobs on the 94-97 Accords. I have seen a few cars from that vintage missing them."
1036	September 11, 2004 1:34AM	corvette	"Statistically, they are pretty reliable, but I've never driven one I'd call ""well built."" Toyota is a much better built Buick, although the ride is similar.

Honda has some awesome inline fours, Subaru has some awesome flat-fours. Incredible smoothness.

It's really a shame about Toyota, they have the talent, methods, and capital to build a better BMW, and the perfect opportunity to blow them out of the water with BMW's iDrive and the unfavorable exhange rate causing price increases on cars like the new 5-series. The problem is that they are not a large enough ""volume"" car for Toyota to bother with."
1037	September 11, 2004 3:51AM	nippononly	"seeks less ""flash"" and more solid careful growth. I think that is the main reason they do not attempt to build the better BMW, although they certainly did enough comparing of the IS300 and the BMW 325i when the IS came out.

I have had lots of experience with late 80s, now early 90s Hondas, and the predicaments are predictable (say that five times fast!). If there are any problems with these cars, they are non-functional rear lights (and wiper if so equipped), non-functional dash lights, electronic problems with the HVAC controls that are not related to vacuum door operation, hinky power window/sunroof and cruise control switches, plus the odd assortment of leaking trunks (yes, I know this last is not electronic!) thrown in there. And I have not witnessed this stuff under the 150K range, so 120K-plus is not the age of car to which I am referring.

Except for the occasional leaky trunk, it is very rare to come across old Toyotas with these types of problems. The flip side is, Hondas are more willing drivers in their old age, and easier to smog too."
1038	September 11, 2004 6:46PM	corvette	"My dad owned:
First year Honda CRX ('86?) - good car, but I don't really remember it that well.
1990 Honda CRX Si - 180,000 miles and it never left him stranded. No sunroof problems, trunk leaks, light problems, etc. Says to this day it's the best car he's ever owned.
1991 Honda Civic Si - Similar mechanicals but not as fun as the CRX. Infrequent oil changes. He put over 250,000 miles on it and sold it to a friend. I think the engine held out to about 300k. Again, very dependable, although it did leave him stranded once, due to a fairly common ignition problem on those cars, which was supposed to be fixed as a silent recall, but wasn't.

The big problem I see on the 1980's-90's Hondas is rust along the rear wheel arches in northern states."

I've always picked Hondas over Toyotas because I've found them easier to buy.. I live in a metro area with six dealers for each brand, and I have to take a shower after leaving each and every Toyota dealer... At least three of the Honda dealers are worth doing business with..

If I had to pick a car to go 200K, then I'd have to go with the Toyota.. If I want the better owning (i.e.: buying, driving, maintenance, dealers) experience for the first 5-7 years, I'll take the Honda.

1969 Pontiac Catalina Safari Wagon (86)
1986 Mazda B2000 LX longbed (89-96)
1978 Chevy Caprice Classic (96-97)
1987 VW Jetta GL (97-00)
1988 Olds 98 (98-today)
2000 Ford Focuz ZTS (99-02)
2002 Honda Accord LX (02-today)

The 69 Pontiac station wagon, in it's way, was a blast. That car was beyond huge, and could hold 9 passengers plus cargo (roof rack), and had a magic two way tailgate. 400 engine moved the car with authority and sucked gas like there was no tomorrow. And for this car, for me, there was no tomorrow, because as a college student I couldn't keep up with repairs. Bought it for a grand and sold it for $700 six months later.

The 86 Mazda B2000 truck was bought new by my parents, who more or less gave it to me for the endless years I was in grad school. I thought this was a great truck. No AC, but otherwise deluxe and fun to drive with the slick 5-speed. Gave it back to my parents when got married and had a kid (while still in grad school) in trade for the

78 Caprice that they'd inherited from my grandfather. It was big and sucked gas through the hidden filler behind the license plate. Was rear ended by an old guy in a c.88 Honda Accord. It appeared that the Chevy had almost no damage while the Accord was really beat up, but our frame was bent and the insurance co. bought us out for $1700.

Moved and bought the 87 VW Jetta from a couple that had just purchased a brand new Volvo wagon. The VW was a one-owner car with full records, and it looked like he'd fixed everything, so so I paid $3200 for it in 97 when it already had 120k. Big mistake. Love the handling and trunk space, loved the 5-speed, but the repairs cured me of VWs, probably forever.

Still had the VW when it seemed like we needed two cars and bought the 88 Olds 98, also a one-owner car with records, for $3800 in 1988. I liked it better than the VW in some ways, because even thought it needed repairs it didn't seem like a POS like the VW. $7000 in repairs and maintenance later we still have it, but I'm beginning to think about a Honda Accord replacement when it does.

2000 Focus, was bought to replace POS VW. Turned out to be just as big a POS. Cured me of Fords. Would have taken a bath on it at trade in time, but Ford credit card bought down the price by 5k, and so only lost c.3k from purchase price when we traded it in 2.5 years after buying it for our

2002 Accord LX 5-speed. So far the best car I've ever owned by far. I'm one of those embarrassing converts to the Honda religion."

It had a really peculiar problem where when you went to start the car, if it wouldn't start on the first try, when you went to turn the key back to give it a few seconds to try again (ah, the joys of old cars!), the solenoid would stick, the starter would keep cranking, and the sucker would keep trying to turn over. Even if you took the key out! It would do that until you either got it to start, or got out and pulled a battery cable loose, which was always accompanied by a shower of sparks!

Unfortunately, by the time I had gotten this car, I already had too many, and didn't have the time or money to give this beast the attention it deserved. Looking back, I should've just had it towed to a mechanic to be fixed right, because obviously there was something else making these solenoids stick! I lost track of how many solenoids I ended up putting on that car...

That sucker was fast though...when it ran! And for its size, it really was a good-handling car."
1048	September 12, 2004 8:21PM	boomer1b	"GM used/use ""shims"" on certain applications for proper clearance between the starter body and engine block to give clearance to the drive and flywheel teeth to prevent binding on start up.
Whomever had the car before you prob. threw them away. Thus all the solenoid/starter problems."
1049	September 13, 2004 12:09AM	isellhondas	"A lot of thse shims were thrown away. Also, for some reason most of the rebuilts were just junk. In order to sell for a price, very little was actually ""rebuilt"". A cleaning and a coat of paint made these look good.

I remember a lot of shops got to the point where they refused to use rebuilts. Instead they would only install factory new starters. These were VERY expensive compared to the rebuilts but they gave no troubles.

Of course, the old time shops with the right equipment would carefully rebuild the customer's old starter. Sadly, this is a lost art."
1050	September 13, 2004 2:16AM	benjaminh	"The starter on my Pontiac was the first thing to go out! I drove it down from Berkeley (where I bought it) to Santa Cruz (where I was going to school--don't laugh--go banana slugs!) and parked it with pride, only to need a tow to the repair shop the next day.

I remember Andre that you sometimes have great pics of your cars. Any pics of the nose of your Bonnie? The nose of my Catalina was a sight to see. It was a Jimmy Durante special, and I loved it long with the Chief Pontiac head high beam indicator."

So what if I go to a car lot once a week and get the free auto shopper publication every time i'm in the store? It means nothing. This is the chronic BUYERS board, not the chronic SHOPPERS board.

speaking of shopping, my wife asked me if, after buying the Benz, that means I stop shopping. Ummmmm..... dear .... NO!

I'm in kind of the same situation as you, Jolie...lots of land (4 1/4 acres), but no garage. There is one old building that used to be a garage, but it's too narrow to get a modern car into. It was built back in the days when cars had running boards, narrow passenger cabins, and tiny doors. And even worse, it's only about 5-6 feet from the property line, and the entrance faces out on the neighbor's driveway. Reason it ended up that way is the property used to be much bigger, but then a few acres were divided off on one side, and then the other, and as a result that's how the garage ended up. I've been thinking about trying to bust in the other side and build an entrance, but the building is so old and needs so much other work it might just be more worthwhile to tear it down and build something new."

stickguy - the volvo ('98) is way more comfortable and WAY faster than the Benz. But I understand your point (i thought about it myself). But its kind of like having a backup car. As a matter of fact, the volvo is laid up right now because I sent the ABS controller out for repair. Turns out that the speedometer/odometer won't work without it. This wasn't so bad, but then, coming home last night, I realized the headlights don't work either! So now that we have the Benz, I can drive that while I wait for the ABS controller to return. Since both cars have ~100K miles and both are european, I have a feeling that there will be many times one is waiting for parts while i drive the other. Yes, there's always the Alfa, but with just that as my spare, I'm always hoping that its warm and dry outside when one of the other cars decides to break down."

Unless we want the Lexus out of the back of the garage. Although right now we only have the Lexus and the Civic in the garage because we haven't had the motivation to put the Lexus back up again (and gee doesn't want to disturb the spider community that has developed on his car). So the Ody and Accord stay outside. Although today since it was raining and I took the Si to work I pulled the Accord in the garage so Gee wouldn't have to get out in the remnants of Hurricane Ivan to go somewhere.

We have been considering opening ourselves up to relocation for me to get a promotion but we aren't sure what we would do with 4 cars considering we would probably be in an apartment temporarily.

It's a fairly big 2-car garage, something like 24x24 feet inside, but there are workbenches, a fridge, a big compressor, a sink, two lawn tractors and a roto-tiller, and other assorted junk that have to fit in there too. And while the garage is wide, the door doesn't seem to be quite 2-car. Anyway, to make them fit, I had to angle that DeSoto in, toward the side, then jack up the back of the car and swing it around. It's tucked in nice and neat and out of the way (unless we need to get something from that side of the garage!), but I have a feeling that it's not going to come out of that spot as easily as it went in!"

Thanfully, our garage has a little room on the left hand side for us to keep all of the lawn tools. The riding mower goes between the cars and the lawn trailor goes in the back left corner.

Makes me think a bit of one of my managers from my pizza delivery days. He got robbed and shot (just grazed, thankfully) and then beat the hell out of the robber. The robber actually tried to SUE my manager, but at least the court system acted properly that day, and justice was served. He won a judgement for 56,000 against the robber.

Well, everything was great until the tech took the truck out to see if the tire pressure light would come on. He was told to drive it 15 miles out and 15 miles back. TWO HOURS and nearly 100 miles later he comes back, to say I was pissed is an understatement.

I went up one side of the service manager and down the other, I'm sure he passed that on to the tech. Not only did he use up 1/4 tank of gas, put 80 miles on my truck, keep it out for 2 hours, but he also ATE in it.....a cardinal sin in my world.

They gave me money to replace the gas that was used and the service manager apologized and seemed very embarrassed. GRRRRRRRR, some people are such IDIOTS!!!!"
1115	September 21, 2004 11:52PM	hammen2	"Big news scandal here in the Milwaukee 'burbs a couple of months ago. A couple got a call at 3:30 a.m. from one of the local police departments - wondering if they'd authorized a guy to be driving their Lexus. Nope, the Lexus was in for service. Evidently, the Lexus dealership routinely let their techs take cars home, only this guy had a few drinks and was bobbing and weaving when the cops pulled him over.

A TV crew went into the dealership with the car's owners for a meeting with the general manager, and the crew made the GM insist they would get to talk to him following the closed-door meeting with the owners. After it was over, the Lexus GM threw the TV crew out.

I'm thinking that this policy has been changed... too early to tell if it's affected sales at this dealership. My co-worker will no longer take his IS300 there...

1116	September 22, 2004 12:26AM	anonymousposts	Actually, with the way GA has their system set up now you are unable to renew your tag if your insurance company does not transmit the information to the GA DMVS. So if you don't have insurance you don't have a valid tag.
1117	September 22, 2004 1:36AM	ghulet	"....short of actually impounding the car, people will drive without license or insurance, with expired or invalid registration, stolen or otherwise improper plates (or sticker on the plates). Heck, when I delivered pizzas, I had someone (probably one of my co-workers) steal my brand new $75 Chicago city sticker right off my windshield. It's sad that it's basically become more wise to assume that everyone is a criminal or at least not driving legally, but it has come to that for many of us.

It is cool, though, that GA has at least electronic communication between their DMV and insurance companies, I can't imagine Chicago doing anything remotely that sophisticated, unless they could figure out a way to charge fees for the privelege!"
1118	September 22, 2004 2:34AM	corvette	"I think what people here do is, sign up for a 6-month policy to get their registration, put it on the monthly payment plan, then cancel it once they've shown the DMV the proof of insurance card. If you ask me, a few mandatory weeks in the clink would really cut down on this problem...

While I'm grinding axes, how come no one ever posts the names of the dealerships where they have problems? Autoweek did this on their Jaguar XJ8 recently, and people on the boards do it all the time. Here's my list of dealerships which are complete write-offs in my book of personal experience:
1) Don Jacobs BMW, Lexington, KY - pathetic and inexcusable sales experience
2) Montgomery Imports, Elizabethtown, KY - horrible service experiences
3) Bachman Volkswagen, Louisville, KY - horrible sales experience
4) Goodman Nissan, Glasgow, KY - crummy body shop repairs

The problem with rating dealerships publicly is that you only get about 10% of the real story.

Someone ALWAYS feels ripped off if there was an extra $1.80 for gas, oil, and grease, so the consumer runs to the BBB or the local news to complain.

You don't hear about the other 1157 people who listened when the service advisor explained a necessary EPA-generated fee and were smart enough to understand it..."
1121	September 22, 2004 2:14PM	nippononly	in the case of Autoweek, it was nothing like that. I only remember vaguely at this point, but they had multiple repeat problems with the car that the dealership couldn't solve, and in addition the dealership committed some major indiscretion on at least one of the occasions they had the car in, like breaking something else, or staining the seats, or I forget what...
1122	September 22, 2004 4:24PM	cpp	"I'll climb on this soap box...
Charles Barker Infiniti in Virginia Beach, VA - bad sales experience, amazingly horrible service experiences (time and time again...)

In all fairness, I've also got one on the other side of the fence:
Checkered Flag BMW, also in VA Beach - I bought in San Diego, so I can't say anything about their sales, but their service is phenomenal. From timeliness to courtesy to attention to detail, I have never been disappointed. They're expensive now that my 3 years of 'free' maintenance is over, but I always leave happy. Charles Barker Infiniti is also expensive, but I rarely leave feeling better than irate - never happy."
1123	September 22, 2004 5:40PM	qbrozen	it was that the dealership had put their repaired tire in the back seat (instead of back on the car!), which stained the seat. the dealership tried cleaning it, couldn't, so then had to dye the entire seat. YIKES! And now the dye job is wearing off and the stain is showing again. Yeah, pretty horrendous experience, I'd say.
1124	September 22, 2004 6:00PM	anonymousposts	We've bought from about 4 different Honda dealers, 1 Toyota dealer, 1 Acura dealer, and 1 Chevrolet dealer. We've had some not as great experiences but never some of the horrendous experiences you see reported on here. We have had a couple of horrendous shopping experiences though. Like the Honda dealer that wanted us to pay MSRP + $600 transportation for us to buy a 2003 Accord EX-L coupe (this was in November 2002) while only giving us $13,000 for our 2000 Honda Civic Si. OTD was $26,500 there. We ended up buying elsewhere for $23,500 OTD.
1125	September 22, 2004 6:39PM	michaellno	"A few weeks ago, I came to y'all to talk about our next vehicle, which I thought was going to be a small SUV or crossover for Mrs. Michaell. Now we may be moving in a different direction.

The situation is this -- we currently have 3 cars:

1999 VW New Beetle - driven by 18-yo son
2003 Saturn L300 - driven by wife
2003 Ford Focus ZX5 - driven by me

The original idea was that the Focus would be driven by our 16-yo daughter (she will get license when she accumulates enough night driving hours and gets a part-time job). I would go back to driving the Saturn and the wife would get the next new car.

The problem is that the Focus is a stick and we're not absolutely certain that the daughter can (should?) drive a stick as her first car. Don't misunderstand -- she will learn to drive the stick eventually. So, now we're thinking that the daughter will get a reasonably inexpensive, automatic something-or-other.

This is where I come to you.

For whatever reason, the wife is not a big fan of buying used cars (I'm working on her, but it's slow going). She is thinking of a new Hyundai, Saturn or perhaps another Focus w/ AT. Me, I'm thinking a 2 or 3 year old sedan of some sort may be the perfect fit. Lots of choices out there, both domestic and imported.

Financially, it seems to be a wash - we're thinking of something in the $10-14K range, regardless of which direction we go in. The daughter would pay for gas and insurance, while mom and dad pick up the car note and the maintenance.

Thoughts?"
1126	September 22, 2004 6:42PM	kyfdx	An '02 Protege with automatic.. would have warranty left, be reliable, good on gas, fun to drive and could be purchased under $10K.

And if you get the 1.8L it's even fun to drive fast. The 2.0 doesn't like high rpm."
1128	September 22, 2004 7:13PM	harlequin1971	"I am not a fan of Saturn...but I would avoid the Hyundai Automatics for at least one more model generation. According to a few resident Lemon Law folks around here...the Elantra Auto has been very problematic. (I own a 5spd Elantra.)

If you want a great car that is easy to own and operate in an Auto, I would fully endorse the Honda Civic HX Coupe with a CVT auto. I owned one for 3.5 years until it was smashed into by a Dodge Durango. It was safe, easy on gas (34-38 mpg), fairly reliable (minus a faulty design on the power windows), and very reasonable to buy (paid $14k new for mine)...

That said, I learned to drive in a 5spd...besides the very real potential that she will blow up a clutch in her first year...I found that learning to drive in a manual was not really more difficult.

Good luck in your decisions, let us know what you buy!"

I know I would be unhappy with that arrangement."
1132	September 22, 2004 7:40PM	stickguy	Ignoring the fact that IMO a 16 year old doesn't need her own car, give her the beetle (after all, it is a chick car), give the son the Focus (is 18 old enough for a stick)?, and follow the rest of the plan.
1133	September 22, 2004 7:59PM	anonymousposts	"I don't know about a new car. First cars have a tendency to get dinged and dented so you would have that hit in value along with normal new car depreciation. Personally I would buy a 2-3 year old sedan along the lines of a Sentra, Civic (great crash tests for it's class), 01-02 Accord DX or VP, or a Corolla. The Protege is a nice car but the insurance on our 01 ES was more than on our 2001 EX V6 Accord Coupe.

If your wife is bound and determined to go new here are a few choices I feel would be better than the Hyundai, Focus, or Saturn:

04 Sentra 1.8s (power windows, locks, keyless, and AC) automatic: should be able to get it for around $12,000 with the $2500 rebate.

2004 Lancer ES (power stuff, AC, CD player): $13,500 or so. These are a bargain used. You can get a 2003 with <20,000 miles for around $10,000.

2004 Civic VP (AC, CD player) $12,500-$13,000

2005 Corolla CE w/ automatic: $13,800 w/ $750 rebate

2004 Chevrolet Malibu Base: $14,200-$14,500 if you finance through GMAC.

If you want to stretch the budget a bit you could buy a 2005 Accord DX automatic with AC for around $16,000. The Accord has tilt, power mirrors, ABS, side curtain airbags, and CD player.

I've also seen 05 Camrys advertised for $15,998."
1134	September 22, 2004 8:05PM	corvette	I'll be.... Head *and* chest side airbags are standard on all 2005 Accords! Way to raise the bar, Honda!
1135	September 22, 2004 8:10PM	anonymousposts	I think the standard ABS along with the standard side airbaigs and side curtain airbags make the Accord an excellent choice for those on a budget. You get the same 2.4L 160HP i-vtec engine, great gas mileage for the size and power, more room than most economy cars, and great crash test scores with the side curtains. If my son were 16 and I was determined to buy him a new car the Accord DX would be very high on my list ... although it would be a manual transmission.
1136	September 22, 2004 9:01PM	michaellno	"I knew I'd get feedback ...

OK, here is some more background.

* The Beetle is a stick; we bought the car new in Dec '98 and it now has 66K on it. So far, so good.

* The Saturn, when bought, was meant to be my everyday car. It has been the car our daughter learned to drive in. I don't have a problem with her driving it after she gets her license.

* The daughter is not too much into cars, so there is no ""cool"" factor with her brother driving the Beetle. However, if pushed, the daughter would really love a Mini - approx $18K when outfitted with the CVT.

To respond to specific comments:

harlequin - thanks for the heads up on the Hyundai automatics; that is something to think about.

anon - thanks for the recommendations; a few I had thought about (Lancer and Corolla), and a couple I hadn't (Sentra and Civic).

I've had 3 Hondas in the past ('85, '92 and '93 Accords), but for some reason the wife has a ""thing"" against them. I can't tell you what it is, because I don't know myself, but it's just a brand she's not comfortable buying. Irrational? Yep, in spades, but she has a right to her opinion, and I, as the loving and faithful husband, will honor and respect it.

On top of that, she's a big Ford gal ('86 Tempo, '97 Escort, '99 Expedition and an '02 Explorer before the Focus), so that is a direction she would be leaning towards.

None of this is happening soon - daughter must first get her license, then get a job to pay insurance. Probably around Christmas or so.

But, thanks for the input and feedback. I'll keep you posted.

Really, I want to be a true CCBer, but the budget just won't allow it!"

1138	September 22, 2004 9:37PM	nippononly	"could you really get an '05 Accord DX with auto and A/C for $16K? The sticker with destination would be around $17,5 BEFORE the air conditioning (which would be dealer-added, never my favorite option) which would add about $1000 to the price, for a total of $18,5. Around here the dealers are still working on clearing out the '04s, and you would find nary a one that would sell you an $18,500 '05 Accord for $16K.

The Sentra 1.8 might be the best bet of all those cars listed."

I could be way off on the cost of dealer-installed AC though.

I may be with you on the Sentra. They seem bullet-proof and you can't beat $12,000 for a car with it's reliability record and it's not even the strippo-version. It comes fairly well-equipped for that price. Of course for $12,000 I would probably go ahead and buy the Civic VP for the safety rating vs. the Sentra.

But I would challenge the assertion you could get the car for $500 below invoice. Around here right now that would be invoice PLUS $500, and only after much back-and-forth, patience-trying, and time-wasting. So maybe you could get the car at $17,2 or so with the A/C.

You could also get the base Camry at that price or a little less, but it would not have the side air bags and curtains. It WOULD have factory A/C, though, which to me would be an intangible benefit I could not necessarily place a dollar figure on.

Oh, and on the Sentra thing, I was kind of assuming you could get that Sentra for about $1500 less than the Civic VP, real-world. But if I could get them both to the same price, I would take the Civic over the Sentra, no question.

Something else to consider, insurance rates. Check and see what it'll hurt the wallet on those compacts. Maybe look into some midsize like Buicks and Olds, or even Taurus, Malibu, Intrepid, in the 3-4 yearold range. They are a little bigger equaling better crash protection for still learning driver. And much better on ins. rates. Even as an older kid(30yrs old) my 94 Civic cost as much as my 99 Contour, if not more. And that's with 5 years clean driving record. Since you have time, check the ins. rates, and if you chose, adjust your shopping accordingly. Good luck! My daughter is only 3, so I have atleast 12 years before I start worrying."

We have got to get back to cheaper cars. However, new cars are addictive. I think I am over my sickness though.

1160	September 24, 2004 2:10PM	andre1969	"about the older Accords, and even the older Civics, is that while they were much smaller back then, it seemed like they had more legroom, at least, than a current Civic. A friend of mine had an '80 Accord hatchback in college. Tiny little thing, and woefully underpowered, but I could fit in it (up front, at least) without too much complaining. It felt tight because it was so narrow inside, but there was enough room for my legs, at least. The main area that it suffered was in the back seat and the storage area.

I had a 91 Civic rental car once. I put about 1600 miles on it in the course of about a week. Again, I fit fine in it, up front. It didn't feel very claustrophobic, thanks mainly to the low cowl and beltline, and generous use of glass. But then that brought up a new feeling, one of vulnerability. There just wasn't enough car around me! And, like my friend's 1980 Accord, this one seemed to mainly sacrifice the back seat and trunk area, and put its focus on the front seat, so you could at least get two tall adults to ride in comfort.

But now, fast forward to the current day, and I can't even fit in the front seat of a modern Civic! It almost feels like they made the back seats and trunk bigger, and improved shoulder room and headroom, but they actually took away legroom up front! My uncle's '03 Corolla feels the same way, although I don't have any experience with older Toyotas to see how they've progressed. And his Corolla, while still a little tight, felt better than the Civic.

Maybe they figure that most Americans are getting fatter, but not taller?

I also noticed it, with the current Camry. Put me in a 1983 Camry, which is diminutive by today's standards, and I fit fine. Plenty of room to stretch out behind the wheel. And while it was narrower than a modern Camry, shoulder room really isn't an issue with a car with bucket seats, unless they place the seat too close to the door. But when I get inside a current Camry, I'd rather ride in the back seat, because I just don't fit comfortably up front!"

1163	September 24, 2004 3:18PM	andre1969	"and even though I was already 6'3"" by the time I was driving and riding around in my friend's 1980 Accord, and that '91 Civic rental, etc, I hadn't filled out as much. Even though I'm not fat, not by a long shot (I'm only like 185-190 lb, although it's been months since I've stepped on a scale, so maybe I've porked up some!), I found some old pics from when I was married (late '95/early '96) and my first thought was DAMN I was skinny!

And yeah, as I get older, I find that I'm less willing to put up with being in a tight, cramped space than I was when I was younger.

Even as things are now, I'm really lucky that I don't have a very long commute. I discovered that on longer trips, my left leg starts to cramp up in my Intrepid after about 45 minutes. Normally, that wasn't a problem, as I only lived about 25-30 minutes from work (more like 10, now!) and when I delivered pizzas, I was constantly hopping in and out of the car.

First time I drove any considerable distance though, my leg started cramping up. I think the main problem is that with most of the older, RWD cars that I've owned, I can stretch my left leg out, but the Intrepid has a dead pedal, which robs legroom, although most FWD cars have the curve of the wheel well behind the dead pedal anyway, so it's not like that space is very usable to begin with! The Dead pedal is too close, and at too awkward of an angle for my tastes, and my size 13 foot doesn't fit too well on it. On my older cars, like my Dart, NYer, Gran Fury, DeSoto, etc, I can stretch my leg out all the way. On the Intrepid, if I twist it just right, I CAN get my left foot up behind the brake pedal and stretch out, but that's not the safest thing in the world to do! ;-)"
1164	September 24, 2004 6:58PM	gee35coupe	"Is that it has too much room. I learned how to drive in a VW Bug and have always loved smaller cars. I feel more ""at one"" with the car. That's why I drive the Civic all the time and will pick it over any other car in the driveway.

Also why I wanted the $500 Festiva that Anony would not allow me to buy this week. It was like putting on a latex glove."
1165	September 24, 2004 7:07PM	andre1969	"of being ""at one"" with the car. Although oddly enough, with me I feel best in cars like my old 1980 Malibu coupe, 1982 Cutlass Supreme, 1986 Monte Carlo, or '68 and '69 Darts. Those cars seemed to fit me perfectly. Not too big, and not too small. The Malibu was my first car. My Mom bought it new when I was 9, and then gave it to me when I got my license at 16. So that's probably why cars that type seem to fit me the best...it's just what I learned to drive on!

As for too much room though, the only cars I've had that would really give me that feeling are my '57 DeSoto and my '67 Catalina. And that's mainly because they don't have power windows, and I can't reach the passenger side crank from the driver's seat. Well, I can on the DeSoto, because it doesn't have seatbelts, so I can just slide over a little! ;-)"

1169	September 24, 2004 8:28PM	lemko	GM's 1977-era B and C bodied cars are the perfect size for me. The M-body Chrysler also fits pretty well. My 1975 Cadillac Sedan DeVille was as big a vehicle I ever drove but was like piloting a CV-class carrier. My girlfriend's Olds Cutlass is too small. My Seville STS is about as small as I'd want to go.

1171	September 25, 2004 12:05AM	andyman73	Listening to you guys complaining about room reminds me of my own experiences. I learned to drive in a 78 Dodge van, only power options being power assist brakes and gas pedal, had 318 and a 4 on the floor M. Gobs o room!!! Had seating for 8, and could comfortably carry 14. Then the first car I actually owned was an 86 Lincoln T/C, I went all the way down in size to an 88 Honda CRX Si, but now am up to a 99 Ford Contour. I loved each in it's own special way. If I had a few bucks laying around I'd offer to relieve you of your spider condo. Before I did that, tho', wife's uncle has an 01 LS 430 w/@ 55K on it, that he's looking to move, time for an 05 YM.

1173	September 25, 2004 5:38AM	akangl	I went and drove a 2004 Ram 2500 Hemi today, couldn't help myself. I liked it, still like my Titan better.......course the Titan is headed back to the dealer on Monday or Tuesday, something with the exhaust now, when slowing down it sounds like a harley revving up. Just started this today, scared me half to death the first time it did it. I dunno, I love my truck and feel like I cheated on it today, lol.
1174	September 25, 2004 8:21PM	gee35coupe	I heard they were having issues, but durn.
1175	September 26, 2004 12:19AM	akangl	Today the truck started howling at any speed above 60 mph. This is nuts, I'm hoping that the dealer can figure it out and fix it. Right now I don't trust it to go very far from the hospital. Ah well, I'll just keep getting it fixed, its under warranty.
1176	September 26, 2004 12:38AM	andyman73	I think Nissan should give an even swap for an 05, and just be done with it. All these trips to the dealer with so few miles sounds like a Lemon Law tree starting to grow.
1177	September 26, 2004 9:45PM	bryan	ended up looking at new cars while I waited for a ride. Didn't drive anything, but did sit in the new Pontiact G6. Nice style and interior too. All the talk about fitting into a car in the few posts above made me thing of this new G6--car appears smaller than what I am used too but sure has a nice size cabin. I fit perfect, especially with the adjustible pedals and steering wheel. Looked like fit and finish was right up there too. Also looked at an '05 Bonneville GXP in Crimson. It made me glad I bought my '04 in gray. But, I could picture driving the red one too! I'll bo okay as long as I just go to the service area when I pick up the car being serviced next week!
1178	September 26, 2004 10:14PM	akangl	"My Titan has straightened up, not sure what was up the other day. The VDC scared the heck out of me today, rather than let the truck fishtail it stopped the truck, course I immediatly thought that something was wrong with it until I saw the slip light on the dash.

Hubby drove the Ram 2500 today and liked it, but didn't like it enough to allow the Titan to leave the stable. So we will continue on and hope that the Titan settles down for a while."
1179	September 27, 2004 1:10AM	benjaminh	"Thanks for the pix of the Pontiacs, Andre. They sure don't make anything like that today. What did those cost new back in the late 60s?

I think it's kind of silly what all of us have gotten used to as standard on cars these days, myself included. A DX Accord for 05 has ABS, a stereo, power windows, fairly big tires, 6 airbags, etc., etc. Twenty years ago you didn't get a radio, power anything, it had small tires, no right mirror, etc. Our 79 Datsun 210 had no carpets, no ac, gutless 1.2 engine, no power steering, etc. It still cost $3740 new. It was about the cheapest car you could buy in the US at the time, and it was quite reliable, but even the Korean cars today look opulent and powerful in comparison. A kid of today could not believe that we drove such a thing--because it was so spartan, and because they would not believe how much in the way of arm strength it took to park."
1180	September 27, 2004 3:48AM	ghulet	"I dunno, most of the cars with no power steering back then ('70s-80s, not talking about the bigger, stripped down cars of the '50s-60s) were so light that they really weren't so hard to park under most circumstances. Last car I had with no PS was my '85 Golf, it was fine usually.

I see your point, though. Most people are mortified now if they have to roll their own windows, adjust their mirrors manually, or the car has no CD player. About the only 'absolute' to me for a new car is still A/C, though I have yet to own a car with a fully-functional air conditioner, so it's not like I'm not used to it. Still, if I were writing a check every month, gotta have air."
1181	September 27, 2004 3:55AM	nippononly	me too, and just TRY to find a car on the market today with A/C and crank windows. That's the combo I want (along with no P/S as long as it is under 3000 pounds). I haven't exhausted this question, but I am willing to bet there isn't one. Oh wait, except the Lotus Elise - can't it be optioned that way? DURN I would love one of those!
1182	September 27, 2004 4:50AM	ghulet	Right now, you can get lots of cars with just A/C and crank windows (base Matrix, which are all but impossible to find, Corolla CE, Civic VP, Mazda 3i, base Miata {good luck}, Jeep Wrangler, and any low-end American {Focus, Cavalier} or Korean car). I don't know if there are any cars sold in the U.S. without PS, maybe Kia Rio or Hyundai Accent?
1183	September 27, 2004 5:11AM	nippononly	"you hit that one on the head, I just went and did a little quiet web-cruising. Rio IS offered in base form without power steering, as is Echo. For the same price ($10K sticker), Aveo and Accent have power steering.

Both cars would let me add air conditioning as a stand-alone option, rather than as part of a package, but in the case of the Echo there were no base models located anywhere in my ""region"" so the cheapest car anywhere near me had a $12.5K sticker and auto trans along with P/S, A/C, a CD player and other whoopdy-doos.

If I accept the P/S as a fact of life, then you are right - I forgot just how many base models have standard A/C nowadays. It is like the automakers finally figured out people really like it, and it becomes an issue of economies of scale to try to offer a trim line without it. Even though many still offer crank windows, at least in theory. I have actually seen a new Corolla with crank windows in recent weeks, as well as a Civic VP. Focus just upscaled for the '05 MY, and P/W are pretty much standard there now, as far as what dealers are stocking. Cavs? Wouldn't know, wouldn't buy."
1184	September 27, 2004 2:20PM	anonymousposts	"There are a fewthings I ""gotta have"". AC, sunroof, and cruise. Since I want those I usually end up with the higher trim. One thing I like about our Si is that it is loaded but still pretty basic at the same time.

I think trying to decide whether to buy out the Accord or the Odyssey at the end of the lease is satisfying my chronic car bug. The plan all along has been to turn the Ody in and buy the Accord but now I'm thinking the Odyssey might be the better choice just in case we decide to have more little gee's. I don't really want to trade cars like we have been so I would like to keep the one we can drive the longest. Oh well, we have about 17 more months to decide.

akangl:I just think you have bad car luck. Not sure if it's you or the Alaska climate though."

Wife has now narrowed the field down to the Outback, Saturn VUE AWD V6, and the Hyundai Santa Fe (LX AWD with the 3.5L V6). She wants to pull the trigger by Thanksgiving.

We'll see."
1186	September 27, 2004 3:11PM	andre1969	"with no power steering, but I wonder how hard it really was? For one thing, cars had a bigger steering wheel back then, so you could get better leverage. And they did change the ratio. Most power steering is around 3.3-3.5 turns, lock-to-lock (probably even tighter on most newer cars). I think manual-steering is more like 4.5-5 turns.

The closest experience I had to no power steering was when the pump failed on my '68 Dart. Technically, I guess that would make it WORSE than non-power steering, since you still had the tighter lock-to-lock ratio, and also had to ""fight"" with the pump. One of my friends took his driver's test in that car. First time through he failed instantly, and the cop that went out with him on the test had to drive my car back, all the way through the course. My buddy said the cop was cursing my car the whole way through!

Oh yeah, back in college I also knew a girl with an early 80's Dodge Colt, no power steering. I drove it a few times, and it didn't seem to be a problem.

I think in larger cars, power steering was pretty much standard by the mid 70's. I think by '77, it may have still been optional in something like a base Pontiac LeMans. Around that time, wasn't Pontiac actually trying to under-cut Chevy in some markets, while at the same time trying to reach into Buick/Olds territory?

As for crank windows, has anybody noticed, in the few cars that still have them, that it's almost like they go out of their way on purpose to make them as obnoxious as possible, almost as if to punish you for not getting power windows? On most of my older cars with crank windows, usually 2-3 turns of the crank and that window went down, effortlessly and smoothly. And the crank knob was big enough to comfortably grab ahold of, and usually positioned in just the right spot.

Nowadays though, they use some kind of tape-drive mechanism that's not nearly as smooth, requires more effort to crank, and what took 2-3 turns back in the day is now 4-5 or more. I guess if they made the window go down too quickly, it would put too much stress on the tape-drive thingy. I've noticed that with power windows, too. They don't drop or raise nearly as fast as they used to (presuming a fully functioning motor, of course...as they age they do slow down sometimes) And then there's the crank. A cheap, tiny, flat plastic little thing that feels like it's going to break off in your hand. One reason they do that is for safety, so it doesn't injure you as badly in an accident. But it's still annoying as hell! And instead of bludgeoning yourself on something that's metal (at least some of those older cranks did have a soft knob), you might be picking plastic splinters out of your body! And it also seems like they pick the poorest places to put the crank. Too far back on the door, so when I reach for it, it's almost like a contortionist routine."
1187	September 27, 2004 4:25PM	akangl	"Yup, I have terrible luck. I used to say if there's a lemon on the lot I'll find it.

With our Ram the problems are understandable since its nearly 6 years old. The Titan its somewhat understandable being a brand new model and I ended up with an early production truck, both things add up to us being Nissan's guinea pig.

Our Focus turned 8k yesterday and has been a GREAT car so far, no problems with it. The Focus is definatly not the car I expected to be trouble free, but I'm glad it is since its driven the most.

1191	September 28, 2004 2:16PM	nine51	No power steering? It can be a real pain. I remember driving my grandfathers 1962 Ford Galaxy w/ 260 V8 and no power steering or power brakes. It had a pretty big steering wheel, but that 260 V8 was heavy. It wasn't bad when you were moving, but a real problem when you were trying to park. No power brakes was even worse. Didn't follow anyone too closely. My kids 94 Civic DX does not have power steering and it too is bad at very low speed, but pretty light when moving. Older Porsche 911's and 914's don't have power steering, but most of the weight is in the back, so they were pretty light.
1192	September 28, 2004 3:51PM	gee35coupe	"with a big V8 out front. Perfect car for hauling five Marines from 29 Palms to LA in high speed comfort. It threw the P/S belt on a trip to L/A one. OH MY GOD. It was a beast. But we didn't care. We still drove it like that.

That was a great car."
1193	September 28, 2004 3:57PM	nippononly	"(my Corolla wagon) did not have power steering - neither did the second or third cars (a later-model Corolla coupe and a mid-70s 280Z) and they were much more the delight to drive for not having it.

I would probably want P/S on one of those full-size American cars, but on most cars under 3000 pounds I prefer not to have it - makes the steering feedback so much more true, and saves the inevitable expense of a failing leaking mess of a hydraulic pump a few years down the line. Now the new electric power steering? Maybe that has potential. But not in its current form, where it numbs the steering down to the point of video game joystick."
1194	September 28, 2004 4:02PM	kyfdx	"If you have front wheel drive, you want power steering.. My '82 Accord hatchback, a small car by anyone's standards, had no power steering.. With about 65% of the weight over the front wheels, you had to be a longshoreman to parallel park it..

It was a great car, miles ahead of any comparable domestics at the time, but in parking lots, it was a bear to handle. And, I think it only weighed about 2500 LBS."
1195	September 28, 2004 4:10PM	andre1969	"do power steering pumps usually fail? I've only had experience with two of them failing. The first was my '68 Dart, which I bought with a failed pump. My mechanic sealed it later that year (1992), but it never was quite right. It finally all leaked out again in early '95, and I just went back to driving it manual-style. A few years later, I did finally break down and buy a new (well, junkyard) pump and steering box.

The power steering pump on my '79 Newport let go in early '98, somewhere around the 245K mark, I'd guess. Mechanic sealed it back up, and that was the end of it.

BTW, that Newport was a real pain to drive with no power steering! I could get used to the Dart, but I made sure to keep a bottle of power steering fluid with me for the Newport, at least until I finally got it to the mechanic to get it fixed."
1196	September 28, 2004 4:13PM	kyfdx	My '77 Cobra II had the power steering pump start leaking at about 40K miles.. Of course, by then, the rest of the car was a POS also, so that was the least of my problems...

1198	September 28, 2004 4:14PM	alfox	'65 Buick made a lot of noise in the Winter, but that was probably water in the fluid. I've had belts break numerous times, and a PS car with failed PS can be a handfull!
1199	September 28, 2004 4:21PM	nippononly	fail less often than they leak copious amounts of environmentally-unfriendly red stuff all over every place. Left unattended though, they will fail, and then it is like alfox says - a handful. Drove an 80s Toyota van with failed P/S for a week once, and that is a car where you sit right over the front wheels as does the engine (mid-mounted) - WHOA! What a pain.
1200	September 28, 2004 4:25PM	andre1969	about my '68 Dart, when I drove it around with no power steering, is that I had some pretty well-defined triceps! It actually wasn't that bad for the most part, but you really felt it in tight situations like parking lots, parallel parking, etc. And sometimes when I'd come out of the gym after a hard workout, it could be downright painful.
1201	September 28, 2004 4:27PM	alfox	it's the pump that leaks so much as the hoses. Over time the crack. They are (or used to be) cheap and easy to replace.
1202	September 28, 2004 4:43PM	andre1969	"the power steering pump has a ""high pressure"" line and a ""low pressure"" line. It's usually the high pressure line that leaks. My '67 Catalina's pump used to leak at the cap, but after I wrecked my Mom's '86 Monte Carlo, I just took the cap off of its pump, and it solved that problem.

See, sometimes when GM carries on with the same part over the ages and never updates, there are some advantages! ;-)"
1203	September 28, 2004 4:46PM	kyfdx	"On my '77 Ford, it was actually the pump that leaked... slowly.. You could fill it up and get about 50 miles before it would be empty again.. Sold it to a guy who had a BHPH lot.. brought a can of power steering fluid and a driver with him and laid 15 Benjamins on the coffee table...

Somehow, my girlfriend at the time ended up with a new car....."
1204	September 28, 2004 5:08PM	cpp	"First vehicle I owned with PS was a Jeep Wrangler. That was after a Bug, 2 Fiats, a 240Z, a 64 Rambler (Mom's - drove it while rebuilding the Bug), a 67 Camaro (my brother's - kept it warm for him while he was at basic training), and a Toyota PU. I never thought much about it, because I learned to drive on a farm - loaded wheat trucks in soft dirt, etc. My Granddad would give me gentle guidance: ""Aw, hell, son, either git the wheel cut before you quit rollin' or git out of the way!"" Good advice, but doesn't apply so well to parallel parking.

Granddad was also fortunate enough to be with me the first time I drove an automatic after learning (very young) on manuals. It was a GMC pickup (probably 1980 or so), with the wide brake pedal. I did fine until I came up to an intersection and got ready to downshift. Went to stomp on the clutch, caught the brake with my left foot, and just about put Granddad through the windshield. More mentoring followed."
1205	September 28, 2004 5:54PM	andre1969	"when I helped out with an office move at work, I remember watching one of the movers wrestling with the steering wheel of an old cabover Mack tractor trailer that he was trying to maneuver into a tight space. I asked him if it had power steering and he said ""yeah...MAN power!""

What would something that massive be like to drive without power steering? Do they make it something like 40 turns, lock-to-lock, so you don't have to put quite as much effort into it?"
1206	September 28, 2004 6:15PM	cpp	Most of our trucks were 60's era 2-ton Fords and Chevys, with one cab-over IH and an early 50's Chevy. I don't recall any of them having outrageous ratios, although they did have huge steering wheels. Literally didn't steer unless you were moving (at least as a skinny 10-year old).
1207	September 28, 2004 6:26PM	driftracer	"""Armstrong"" steering, because you were guaranteed to have Popeye-looking arms after driving for a while..."
1208	September 28, 2004 6:33PM	andre1969	that was one thing my Granddad taught me to do when I was learning how to drive. I think that was mainly because he had a gravel driveway though, and if you turned the wheels while fully stopped, it would dig in. It really helped out though, when I got my Dart with the broken p/s pump!
1209	September 28, 2004 6:47PM	perna	"Not counting my '83 Pontiac 6000 whose power steering pump died and I just drove it that way, my Escort was the only car I've owned that didn't have PS. Really, it wasn't all that bad, MUCH easier to steer than the Pontiac.

AS a matter of fact I was 18 when I bought the Ford, and not really knowing anything about buying cars had my dad go with me. He used the fact it didn't have PS as a reason to get them to ""cheap sell"" the car. It was an el-strippo, that's for sure; in fact the only option it really had was an auto trans and rear defroster. Oh, and ""AM/FM"" Radio. Could you imagine shopping for cars today and seeing a new one with no tape or CD? The horror!

I bought the Ford in '92 for $4k, and totalled it in '96. My insurance gave me $3600. That Escort remains the cheapest car I've ever owned, or ever WILL own I'm sure. It's almost impossible to do better! The difference between what I paid and what the ins. paid me is less than a single monthly payment on the Maxima!!"

We probably had 10K pounds on it, and when I had to make a 90 degree turn from a stop at an intersection, I literally had to stand up in the cab to get the leverage to turn the wheel.

When I was a kid... all the truck drivers had massive arms, rather than the massive bellies that are so common now.

It was a 30-mile one-way trip and then return. I was more worn out from the drive than I was from the packing and unpacking...

The worst part was, it had such loose steering when it was moving that the ""center"" had about 8"" of travel on the steering wheel...I felt like I was back in my old school bus."
1212	September 28, 2004 10:17PM	andre1969	"glad you liked the pictures. Yeah, there's plenty of parking out here, but unfortunately a lot of the ground is low. It's not so bad right now, but later in the year when the trees and grass quit soaking up the water, a lot of the yard gets soft. Nice for getting buried up to the frame rails! Last year though, we had two big trees that came down in Hurricane Isabel, which took up a big chunk of the ""dry"" part of the yard. It took my uncle and me awhile to get them cleared out, so maybe parking won't be so bad this fall/winter.

Next year, I'm finally going to look into having a garage built. I'm also going to check into how complicated/expensive it would be to have the house moved back from the road, and maybe set on a basement foundation. As you can see in the pic, it was close to the road 40-some years ago! It's worse now, as the road has been widened. And, almost as if on purpose, they made it a little extra wide right in front of the house! >:-("

Had a 318 sitting on top of the front axle, so was a little weighty at slow speeds. Dad drove it like it had ps, little(5'2"" 100lb)mom worked it over pretty good. I didn't think it was no big deal. Mom's Shadow had ps, so it was certainly different. Drove 3 Hondas and 1 BMW 3series, with no ps. Beemer threw a belt, and was leaking, so just drove with out it. I really liked being connected to the road. Now drive a Contour w/ps,and it's not so bad."
1215	September 29, 2004 4:46AM	akangl	I've ever driven with no ps was a 98 Metro 3-cyl hatchback. As far as I know the other cars I've owned had ps, only questionable ones are the 04 Focus and the 94 Escort that I had, but both drove/drive easily.
1216	September 29, 2004 4:52AM	andyman73	I'm sure only power that Metro had was the gas pedal, anything else would take too much from that engine. OTOH, I served with a Marine who had installed a little turbo on his Metro convertible. Said turbo made it run like a big Honda 4 pot. Wasn't much of a challenge for the 88 CRX Si I had at that time. His Metro was worth a good laugh, tho'.
1217	September 29, 2004 6:01AM	akangl	That little Metro would do 80 mph.......um, downhill with a tailwind and only if I fed the hamsters VERY well the hour before. Actually it was a neat little car, 50 mpg and not too horrible to drive.......except for going up hills, I usually had to employ extra hamsters or get out and push. ;-)
1218	September 29, 2004 8:40AM	andyman73	that Marine I knew, drove that car from So.Cal, to just north of Philly, said it cost @ 75 dollars in gas. And that was because the car was loaded to the hilt, cutting into the fuel mileage. I know, I was on duty when he checked in to the unit, and saw how full that car was. Told me that he really had to work the gears to maintain reasonable highway speeds. Said 3rd gear worked great for uphill sections.

My roommate has one, and I've driven it a few times and honestly can't tell if it does or not. It has a weighty feel to it, but no more than my '00 Intrepid or my '89 Gran Fury (copcar with ""firm feel"" power steering) I've looked under the hood and couldn't find anything that looked like a power steering pump, but then everything else is so tiny on that vehicle that I didn't spot the a/c compressor at first, either! It looked to be about the size of an old ignition coil! (okay, I might be exaggerating some there!) It's really light, at only around 2300 lb, and RWD, so it has more of a weight balance than an FWD vehicle. So maybe it just doesn't need it?"

Theoretically it could be a 3 car garage, but there's so much junk in the main part, including work benches, an air compressor, a fridge, two tractors, etc, that it's hard to get two cars in, although I did manage. Unfortunately the buried electric lines going to the garage got messed up and had to be dug up, so right now there's a big trench in front of the 12x25 addition, rendering it basically useless for putting a car in right now. Plus, my uncle found a way to load it up wit a lot of junk.

Hopefully in the spring, I'm thinking about getting a 4-car garage built. Or maybe I could go bigger. I've heard you can actually get those big steel buildings relatively cheap. Building permits might be something entirely different, though!"

1226	October 1, 2004 8:30PM	michaellno	"As many of you know, I'm trying to get the wife a new car. To do that, however, several things have to happen, one of which is to pay off the '99 New Beetle that we currently allow our 18 year old son to drive.

Been running some numbers, and was looking for feedback on the following scenario:

We owe approx $4300 on the Beetle (don't ask why). Private party valuation (Edmunds, KBB) peg the value at approximately $7500. Since the son needs a car, we sell the VW and clear +/- $3K.

Since the son needs a car, we use the profit from the sale of the VW, plus a thousand from us and a thousand from him and we buy him a nice, clean, cheap to insure $5K something or other (ex: found a '97 Chevy Lumina with 67K for $4700). This car would be titled and insured in son's name; he could decide how much insurance to have on it.

That way, we have no payment and no insurance costs for the son's wheels, and we could go out and get the wife a new car.

Please, poke holes in my theory, before I present it to the wife."
1227	October 1, 2004 8:37PM	perna	"The main question is, ""which car is more reliable?"". In your example, you have a '97 Lumina and a '99 Beetle. The Beetle is a known quantity; if you've taken care of it, and it hasn't given you any problems, why would you want to give it up for a potential piece of crap? You've already eaten the ""big"" depreciation out of the car, so if you let the kid drive it through college, it will probably cost you about $3-4k in depreciation. That's it. That's a LOT cheaper than buying and maintaning some 8 year old Chevy piece of crap.

If you want more holes, I'd be happy to oblige."
1228	October 1, 2004 8:37PM	driftracer	"PLUS you get to trade one car for two, adding to your CCB status...

Seriously - makes sense - your son can run liability only to keep insurance costs down (I have a 17 and 18 year old driving, I know), and the car is free and clear, no payments.

He can save money, and in a year or two (or whenever you would decide with him), he can sell the car privately and put a big chunk down on a newer vehicle, putting him in a good financial situation, hopefully, for a long time.

That's the same idea I'm working with on my boys."
1229	October 1, 2004 8:49PM	michaellno	"...I'd get some responses.

perna: we just had the steering rack done on the VW; fortunately, we've got an extended warranty or it would have been a $1200 hit. Brakes were redone earlier this year for $600. We've done all the maintenance on the VW since new, and you're right, it's the devil you know vs. the devil you don't know.

One reason I'm thinking of this is that we do have some equity in the VW, which we can put to good use. Otherwise, in order for wife to get a new ride, we'll have to come up with the whole payoff amount.

Also, the Lumina was just an example; I'm sure there are lots of cars available for approximately $5K that are reliable -- or, at the least, less expensive to repair than the VW.

drift: tell me about it. got a 16 year old daughter and a 15 year old son. we've talked about the idea of the 18 year old being able to sell or trade in whatever car he has at the time for whatever he wants, whenever he wants. But, we figure that a reliable something has to cost less than the $230/month for insurance.

One other thing .. son is still in HS and we don't really know his college plans yet. His girlfriend is in college about 3 hours away, but there is no guarantee that he'll go there."
1230	October 1, 2004 8:55PM	kyfdx	"Check with your insurance agent.. If he is still living in your house, you may not be able to take him off your insurance.. Also, on his own policy, his insurance could be prohibitively expensive.. You could end up paying twice. It is still a good idea.. but, I don't think you'll get him off your insurance policy.

Also, if it were me.. I'm with perna.. keep the Beetle.. If the $4300 you owe on that really makes a big difference.. then you may not be able to afford another car. Think long term, not short term.

regards,
kyfdx"
1231	October 1, 2004 8:57PM	anonymousposts	"The Beetle is a known quanity in some aspects but they have not proven to be the most reliable cars on the market. How about this ... you sell the Beetle and clear $3000 if you and your son combined come up with $2000 you then have $5000 to work with. That should get you a nice used Altima, Protege, Sentra, or maybe even a Saturn or Malibu. Personally, I would try to find an Altima, Protege, or Sentra but if your wife only wants a domestic then you can look for the Malibu or Saturn.

Or better yet .. try to find a Prizm with fairly high miles for around $3500. Then your son will have some money to spare for any unexpected repairs, insurance, and maintenance. I don't think spending $4700 for a Lumina is a good idea but I think you are thinking in the right direction."
1232	October 1, 2004 8:57PM	harlequin1971	"ok - I need more info...

The beetle is +$3k if you sell.
What does the daughter get? Your car? Is that one paid off? We need to see how the whole picture shifts.

Hard to get rid of a known entity if it has been working well...but $5k can get some decent wheels. One thing to let him know, in general, wagons are cheaper to insure and have good storage for moving stuff around. (I moved 6 times in 4 years during college.) The Jetta TDI Wagon was the cheapest car I recently priced out...but I doubt they are old enough to fall into the $5k range.

I would go ahead and pull the trigger on the deal, if it were me...if only to try out something new."
1233	October 1, 2004 9:06PM	michaellno	"Currently, there are 3 cars:

'99 New Beetle
'03 Saturn L300
'03 Focus

Son turned 18 in August, is living on his own, attends an alternative (1/2 day) HS and works full time at a local grocery store; daughter turned 16 in July and is looking to start a job in the next couple of weeks.

The plan is to get out from under the VW, get the son something reliable and put it all in his name. The Saturn would be my daily driver, the Focus would go to the daughter, and the wife would get a new car. Would still have 3 car payments (Focus, Saturn, new ride).

Would need to talk with insurance agent regarding status of son, but since he's a full time student I don't think it would be a huge issue. As drift pointed out, the son could go with liability only and minimize the size of the insurance bill.

anon: no preference on domestic vs. import, just something reliable and cheap to run/maintain. You've provided some excellent examples."
1234	October 1, 2004 9:28PM	volvodan1	"It sounds like a great idea. I agree w/ going to the Prizm, Sentra, even Protege route. Once the VW is out of warranty it's not going to be pretty. Personally a ""used"" VW (like most european brands) are probably not the best for a newcomer to the big world to start out in. The previous examples will be cheaper to maintain, gas and own in general."
1235	October 1, 2004 9:40PM	jlawrence01	"As much as I dislike Luminas (and I am a GM buyer), I believe that they would be cheaper to keep up with than a VW of any sort. And it is a reliable car.

My brother worked with his insurance agent recently to get insurance for my 16 yo niece. This was a big concern as my brother has a newer Ford Mustang. The compromise that they worked out was this. He went out and bought a 1997 Ford Escort with about 20k miles for $3500 cash and therefore, no lien. He purchased LIABILITY ONLY insurance for that car ONLY for her and it was fairly affordable. Of couse, she is NOT covered to drive the Mustang and the Equinox."
1236	October 2, 2004 1:55AM	corvette	The existence of my parents' more expensive cars in the same household never affected my insurance rates nor did my being listed on my car affect theirs, and no one was prohibited from driving another's car. Something seems fishy.
1237	October 2, 2004 3:22AM	jlawrence01	"I don't think that State Farm writes fishy policies. And I have seen this same situation among several co-workers here in Chicago when they went to insure their teen's vehicles.

Most insurance companies DO NOT want and to insure inexperienced drivers driving muscle or sports cars."
1238	October 2, 2004 4:56PM	ghulet	After reading your post, I still don't understand if you're covered on your parents cars. Assuming you are, what do your parents drive? If it's something sporty or terribly expensive, they must be dropping some heavy coin on insurance. When my twin brother and I were 17, my mom traded a Toyota Cressida for a Porsche 944. We were basically uninsurable on that car, she had to buy us a car of our own to save money.

We had some time to kill between the end of the meeting and mall opening so we took a look at the G6. Nice car. It's no CamCord but I like it better than the 6 and the Altima. It has lots of interior room and the buttons have a decent feel to them as well. Overall, it was nice enough to at least warrant a test drive."
1240	October 3, 2004 11:03PM	corvette	"I'm insured on my own car. It made zero difference on the premium if my car was in my name or theirs, though. FWIW, I am 22, and pay ~$800 every six months on my 2002 Altima, with a $500 deductible and the highest liability limits. It seems like my parents' policy runs in the $3-400 range no matter what they buy, currently my basis for this test is Mom's 2002 Volvo S80. Also - had I kept the 2004 BMW 325i, my insurance would have gone down into the $700s. Go figure!

My point was, there is nothing in the policy that excludes me from driving their cars with their permission, or lending my car to anyone. I think you can get a discounted rate if your child is attending school out of town and will only drive the car when they're home on break. The way it was explained to me was, if you have three cars and three drivers, each driver has to be ""rated"" on one car. IOW, you're going to take a big jump on one vehicle."
1241	October 4, 2004 12:20AM	jlawrence01	"My point was that the State Farm agent was able to work out a deal where my niece's insurance was ~$500 a YEAR as opposed to $1800 a year as my brother has some a performance vehicle.

So she is spending a LOT less than you are by accepting more restrictions on what she can drive. It is something that is done all the time. It also helps that my brother had been working with the agent since 1976.

Personally, if she was my kid, she'd be waiting until she was 18 or 22 or could handle all the expenses herself, but that is another subject."

And, if we can't get anything before X-mas (quitre possible if we end up ordering an Ody), we might just as well wait until late winter, and use the current van through the bad weather.

Of course, if we wait too long, my eye will start to wander again, and my car is only 3 months old.

For some reason, every time I end up with a new car, I start thinking fo going real used but interesting for myself. Maybe I should have bought the wife her van first, and then got me some cheap old thing that only Shitright could love.

Actually, after a few months of break-downs and endless repairs, I would remember why I got out of the real old car business."

1265	October 6, 2004 5:56PM	anonymousposts	We tried to find a nice used Volvo before we bought the latest Accord but couldn't find any in the colors we wanted or a manual transmission. We came across a VERY clean 93 Accord EX 5-speed with 160,000 miles that we could've had for $2000 but we couldn't decide so someone else bought it. With our son a newer car (02+) is a necessary evil right now because we want LATCH.

1271	October 6, 2004 9:06PM	hammen2	"The Aurora's suspension was re-done in '97 and then again for '98-'99 to make the car less boaty/floaty. She probably does need new shocks/struts (I can sure feel it on my '98 Aurora with 88k miles...).

The second-gen Aurora came out in early 2000, but GM didn't announce the death of Olds until December of 2000 (though the decision had been made a year or two previous, as work had stopped on next-gen cars after the Aurora and Bravada, and there were no concepts at auto shows). One of the reasons I got my '98 for a song in March of 2001.

Switching gears, am I a CCB, considering we've purchased 2 new GM vehicles in the past month or so? I got a new GTO (which is rapidly turning out to be a lemon - no, it's not yellow, it's purple :-( and just picked up a loaded Envoy SLT 1SD for the wife (heck, got over $13,500 off the MSRP, thanks to GMS pricing and incentives, not including the equity we had in her 2001 GTP we ended up trading in)...

The GTO is a nice ride (I still wish it had a sunroof though). We stopped by the local Pontiac dealer to check out the new G6 and they had three GTO's (two silver and one purple w/ chrome wheels). It had plenty of room and seemed nicely built. Even had some soft-touch plastic on the dash.

I can't wait til little Gee is bigger so we can turn his car seat around and have more car options."
1273	October 6, 2004 9:25PM	bryan	"my Aurora is Red Bordeaux with neutral leather. It's a dark cherrylike almost burgundy color with the chrome wheels. It's a beauty, especially when freshly washed and no neighbors looking for ladders in my garage are lurking nearby, haha. I bought the car from dealer stock in DE. It had been on their lot for one day. It has every option except the CD changer and engine block heater, IIRC. Even has the gold package, which against the dark paint is actually decent.

I always liked the first gen Aurora, but it was a little pricey for me at the time. So instead, I bought a new 96 Olds LSS, which, from what I was told, was then considered the ""poor mans"" Aurora. It's light beige metallic with matching leather. Without question the best car I have ever owned. Not ONE issue at all in first four years--no rattles, nothing, including the after-market sunroof. Car has is now my ""beater"" car, as it has 90K miles. I just recently had to have the A/C compressor replaced, and some other minor stuff along the way (belts/hoses). This car still drives like new. I have never owned any car this long before. As long as it doesn't start nickle and diming me, I'll keep it. I'm religious about regular service, and my mechanic wants the car himself if and when.

Just saw an 01 Aurora advertised at local DC-area dealer for about $16k. Because of the depreciation usually associated with domestic sedans, I will probably just have the paint scratches/damage repaired as I would most likely take a bath if I tried to sell or trade it. I'll keep it, but I'll always keep looking at what's out there. That new Caddy STS is simply awesome looking. Like I've always said, just because I'm on a diet doesn't mean I can't look at the menu! My menu is cars, usually GM cars."

Okay, confession time--I am a CCB--I have four GM vehicles currently, I purchased two of them one week apart in May. #363 of final 500 Olds Aleros, and a Bonneville GXP. My uncle drives the Alero, which has been flawless since delivery. The GXP had a sunroof rattle that was fixed to perfection, and is proving to be an outstanding vehicle. That car just makes me smile when I drive.

I guess that lands me in the pretender pile. I am on an average of around 2 years.

Really though, if the average car loan is just south of five years and most people only keep a car for 4...anything less than 2 should qualify for some honorary status.

I am proposing a hierarchy:

Average a new (but not necessarily NEW) car every 12 months - Gold Club Member (GCM-CCBA)

1277	October 6, 2004 11:38PM	driftracer	a PCM-CCBA-MS....
1278	October 7, 2004 1:35AM	hammen2	"Actually, I don't know if my GTO is a lemon or if the problems are the fault of the dealership's service department. I picked up the car on 8/27 and drove it for about 10 days, putting approximately 800 miles on it. Noted three issues; some paint flaws on the rear quarter panel, a lot of clunking from the rear suspension, and a styrofoam-like squeak noise from the dash. I know it's a sports car, but the ride quality was really harsh (""rides like an old truck"" was a common complaint of passengers :-).

Dealership had the car for 2 weeks, claiming to fix the rear noises by applying a TSB (only the bulletin came out in early April, and my car was built in May after the VIN break). The TSB was supposed to fix the driveline hitting the chassis on hard acceleration - well, I followed the break-in procedures for the car, so it didn't have much hard acceleration and the clunking happened on any concrete road with expansion joints. Dealer did say they could see where the driveline was hitting the chassis...

The bigger problem was the dash noise - dealer went 'round and 'round with GTO brand quality management, eventually talking to ""Russell"" at the Holden plant in Australia. I got the car back for the weekend after two weeks in the shop (unrepaired, dash partially disassembled and windshield removed and reinstalled). The squeak noise I had heard previously was replaced by a loud ""clunk"" noise, most evident on turns. Dealer also scratched the rocker panel under the driver's side (tech kneeling on seat/steel-toed boots hit rocker panel), took a chip out of the top of my hood near the windshield, and put swirl marks on the hood when they washed the car after fixing the paint blemishes.

Took the car back in last week and they claimed to have fixed the problem - evidently, the firewall on the car is a polymer piece glued to the metal frame - they stated that this wasn't bonded correctly, causing the firewall to flex and make the noise. (In the process of doing the repair, they used a jack to hold the polymer up to the metal, knowing they were mangling the strut-tower brace - ordered me a new one). Got the call that the car was fixed late last week. Didn't drive it much this weekend since we were driving the wife's new Envoy, but, on Monday on the way to work, the same clunking noise on turns was evident. Also, twice this week the dash has gone crazy (once it told me I needed gas immediately when I had half a tank, the next time it told me the engine was hot, right after starting the car after it sitting for 4 hours).

I have been speaking with GM Executive Relations and the dealership's VP of Service on an almost daily basis since the beginning of week 2 in the shop. My own personal suspicion is that the dealership never did the PDI on the car, and never removed the styrofoam blocks on the front suspension, or the spring spacers on the rear (I had asked them not to detail the car, as I clayed and Zaino'd it extensively - however found out after driving it for nearly a week that the tire pressure was still at 60 psi it was shipped from Oz - explained the large amounts of rubber on the rims). Driving around for 800+ miles with the suspension packing materials may have hosed the suspension. Again, that's just my suspicion (other GTO owners have told me that they had the styrofoam noise and that this was this exact issue - one buyer had to return his car after only 3 mile due to the control arms getting bent due to this issue). The ride quality was noticeably better when I picked it up after the two weeks...

I have 1150 miles on the car and it probably needs to be in the shop 10 more days before either GM throws in the towel, or I have to file lemon law. Of course, the '04's are dwindling, and, especially since there are only 600 Cosmos Purple cars made, half auto and half stick, the likelihood of me getting an exact replacement decreases on a daily basis...

I'm supposed to meet with the service VP and the Pontiac Zone rep at the dealership tomorrow to take them for a test-drive and hear the noise. We'll see how they decide to proceed. Sometimes I think the service VP would like to just do what I want and get me a new car, but GM seems commited to play this one out ""by the rules"" - nevermind the fact that I and my wife have been pretty loyal GM customers over the years.

Frustrated,

--Robert"
1279	October 7, 2004 2:38AM	stickguy	I would fight for a replacement. Even if they somehow manage to fix the initial problems, it sounds like they have messed up enough other things that it will never be the same. It's not hard to see leaks developing, never mind the body damage.
1280	October 7, 2004 3:16AM	driftracer	"as much as I sympathize, a squeak noise doesn't constitute a ""significant impairment of use, safety, or value"", which is the predominant burden to meet in most states."
1281	October 7, 2004 4:08AM	hammen2	"I took it in for a squeak noise. After they worked on it, it now makes a loud ""clunk"" sound (like hitting/running over a rock) that's pretty apparent to passengers. I can feel the vibration through the gas or brake pedal. Not sure if it is the firewall flexing or a suspension issue... I guess we'll see once it goes up on a lift.

I wouldn't think it would be safe to drive the car long-term - whatever is flexing or banging around, is certainly going to undergo some metal fatigue.

Thoughts of what might happen down the road because of a noise today have no place in lemon law discussions, unfortunately.

I almost never really plan my car purchases in advance. During lunch breaks or weekends, sometimes I'll just go look at cars. Once every year or two, I'll buy one. The last one happened because my wife and I were eating lunch at the Olive Garden (I hate their entrees, but love the Black Tie Mousse!) and discussing what to do that afternoon. ""Let's stop by the Nissan dealer!"", I say. ""The 04 Maximas are coming in soon, I wonder what deals they have on the 03s?""

Two hours later, I'm signing paperwork. This was late February '03.

I think the upcoming danger is the '05 Mustang GT. I ""cruised"" the local Ford dealer today to see if he had any in. Not yet... but one of these weeks I'll ""cruise"" by and one will be sitting there. If I impulsively park the car it's all over. I love my Maxima, but those new Mustangs are too cool for words.

On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, I started thinking that we could get out of the Explorer and into a Focus and save some money -- plus, the Focus would eventually go to our daughter as her daily driver.

1306	October 10, 2004 5:09AM	corvette	My problem with the Altima extends to most front wheel drive cars. If you're making a right turn, pulling out into traffic, and need to launch quickly, a FWD car is harder to steer through the turn, but a RWD car is much easier to control, even assuming you don't take off hard enough to spin the tires. If you don't give it a decent amount of gas to begin with, the automatic will upshift to second just as you complete the turn and apply more throttle.
1307	October 10, 2004 5:39AM	akangl	I agree with you. I noticed that today while driving my Focus (yes its got a little bit of Zip sometimes) after driving my Titan for the past 3 weeks. The Focus is still a blast to drive though, even with winter tires on it.

I've found a local tire install/alignment/balancing place that does an awesome job and pretty much matches Tire Rack's pricing. They're honest, straight-up folks and I've referred several friends and co-workers to them, and all have been pleased.

I'm becoming a bit of a BF Goodrich snob... my Aurora had Michelin MXV's on them, and they were junk. Wouldn't pay $150/tire for them. Now using Traction T/A's on it and loving them.

1318	October 10, 2004 11:27PM	corvette	I will confess to being a Michelin snob. The MXV4's are probably the worst in their lineup, manufacturers like them because of the low rolling resistance. I have a set of Hydroedge's on my Altima right now. They're not performance tires, but really are good in the rain (although they're still new), quiet, and give a firmer ride than the Conti's they replaced (this is also a good thing). I had two sets of MXV4 Plus's on my Jetta, followed by a set of Pilots. The Pilots were superb as long as it wasn't snowing.

They are HORRIBLE in the snow, they are the main reason hubby went over that embankment last winter. Will be putting Cooper Discoverer M+S studded snow tires on the truck this week. Put the Michelins back on in the spring.

My Titan has Goodyear Wrangler SR-A tires, horrible in snow, mud, ice, rain, ok on dry roads.

The Focus runs Goodyear Eagle RS-A tires in the summer and has studded snows on for winter. The Eagles are one of my favorite tires, great in the rain and on dry roads, do ok in snow/ice, not great though."

And they are trying to get into our automotive market, so they have to be priced well below the competition. There for my 99 Contour, that had Firestone Firehawk GTAs that barely lasted 20 thousand miles. The Chinese ones are guarenteed(sp?) for 35K. As far as cheap, I put a pair of tires, can't remember brand, on my Civic. I asked for cheapest, and still cost me 135, installed, at Meineki. And they were pretty much useless on anything less than dry. The tread on the Chinese tires looks nearly night and day better, than the ""cheapos"". But I only drive @ 8K miles a year. YMMV"
1322	October 11, 2004 3:07AM	18fan	"Have you had any experience with Toyo tires? I need to replace the crappy OEM Continentals on my Camry before winter. I was considering the BFG Traction T/A or Yoko Avid H4.... but I was at a local tire shop recently checking prices, and they were really pushing Toyos... saying they are better than BFG, Goodyear, Yoko's, etc... and at a lower price. I have tried to do some research on the web, but have found very little ""objective"" info on Toyo tires.

BTW.... I would qualify for the Silver CCBA membership!"
1323	October 11, 2004 3:26AM	anonymousposts	"We understand what you are saying about the Conti's. We have a set on our 03 Si and they have not been smooth since the day we put them on. Countless rotate & balances helped a little but they are still jiggly at times for no apparent reason.

My mother-in-law just put a set of Toyos on her 93 Accord and Gee said that they are great. Smooth as glass. We also had a set of Proxes on our 2000 Si and had no problems with them either. So I would go for the Toyos if the price is good."
1324	October 11, 2004 3:47AM	badtoy	will give you comparisons on the tires you're considering, and I've found them to be pretty accurate. I bought the Sumitomos for my turbo Rolla that way, and I loved them (I wanted a performance tire that didn't hum like a truck tire, and wasn't so soft they'd go away in 15k). They were Z-rated, and performed exactly as described -- excellent handling, smooth and quiet, and they lasted for over 40k.
1325	October 11, 2004 1:08PM	jlawrence01	I know that everyone else *loves* the Michelins. However, I have had a LOT of problems with them with dry rot, sidewall deterioration, and they tend to be noisier.
1326	October 11, 2004 3:10PM	akangl	Yup, same here. My husband's 99 Ram has its original Michelins on it and the sidewalls are looking worse for the wear, they are starting to bulge a bit too. However, they are still very deep in tread at 23k miles. Switching the truck to winter tires this week since the Michelins are horrible in the snow/ice.
1327	October 11, 2004 3:11PM	anonymousposts	"We went yesterday to look at gee's car of the day, the 2005 Altima Se-R. Loved the outside. Two great big tail pipes, 18"" wheels, decklid spoiler, and fog lights. The interior had special leather, sunroof, nice meaty steering wheel and stick, and the sports gauge package. Overall it was a VERY nice car and I'm sure it's fast. But gee decided that he really didn't need 260HP for the sake of his insurance premium and driver's license so we took a look at a regular 2.5s. It was still a decent car but we have to get a bunch of things we don't want to get what we have to have in the 5-speed manual version. And as silly as it sounds we don't like the XM antenna Nissan uses.

So we came away thinking that our Accord and Civic were still the better choices for us. But then gee started looking at the Titan. He sat in one in the showroom and said ""this isn't too bad. Can you get a sunroof in one of these?"" When I said yes he decided to take a look at a more loaded one. They didn't have one with a roof on the lot for us to drive but we aren't really serious buyers right now anyways.

Well, we think we have figured out what we are going to do with our driveway. Gee has SAID (I've heard this before) that he is going to sell the Lexus. We will drive the Odyssey until the lease ends and then buy us a 2006 Titan LE 4x2 CC with sunroof and DVD. We would continue to drive the Accord and Civic until they just aren't pretty to look at any more (which for some people is now but we like both of them, even the much criticized rear of the Accord)."
1328	October 11, 2004 3:19PM	akangl	"With the Titan, its such an alluring truck that people can't resist. One drive and I was hooked.

I wouldn't sell mine, nope, no way, cause if I did, then regretted it, I couldn't get another one like it. They aren't putting the VDC in the 4x4s anymore and there's rumor that they killed the Sedona color.

Its the closest thing to a car in a truck I've ever driven, its fast, corners like its on rails, and rides great.

So, mine will stay with me until it goes off to the great junkyard in the sky."

Oh, one other note ... the discussion of selling the Beetle and getting our son something less expensive surfaced again .. no definite decisions, but we're still talking. May also decide to get the daughter something small with an automatic, and keep the Saturn and Focus for us.

Around and around and around we go...."

I also liked the fact that it didn't feel like a behemoth like a 2004 F150 Lariat 4x4 I sat in a few weeks ago. That thing was intimidating to sit in. It felt HUGE. The Titan felt much more manageable. It was also neat seeing Gee in a big truck with our son. Then gee could be little gee's ""big bad dad"" like the first commercials for the MB ML320 showed.

Gee's reasons for liking it were much more simple. ""It's supposed to be fast""."
1331	October 11, 2004 3:32PM	michaellno	Got the wife to give some consideration to both the Saab 9-2x Aero and the Volvo V50 T5 AWD.
1332	October 11, 2004 3:32PM	anonymousposts	michaell: You should sell the Beetle. Give your son the Focus and give your daughter the Saturn. Take the money from the Beetle and put it towards whatever your wife wants and get yourself another Focus (they have been improved for 2005) or something fun like a Mazda3. Then you are giving your kids two cars that you know the history of and giving yourselves the opportunity to buy two new cars which doubles your shopping pleasure.
1333	October 11, 2004 3:37PM	michaellno	"Hmm, nice plan, but one flaw .. the budget can stretch for 3 car payments, not 4 ... at least, not for another few years!

Both the Saturn and the Focus have 3 years of payments (roughly) left on them.

Plus, got college to start thinking about ... dauther wants to go to Colorado State, which, for residents, is still something on the order of $10K/year. Can you say ""student loans""?"

Sell the Beetle and buy your son something that is paid for (Sentra, Corolla, G20, and Protege come to mind. Give your daughter the Saturn (it's automatic and she is already used to it). You drive the Focus (IMO, the Focus is probably the most fun to drive out of your current selection) and buy your wife whatever she wants."
1335	October 11, 2004 4:13PM	michaellno	"yep, that's one of the plans we're thinking of.

1) sell Beetle, get son a reliable $5K vehicle (see list in above post). Daughter drives Saturn until she is manual-trans taught, then she gets Focus. Wife gets new car. I drive either Focus or Saturn.

2) Pay off Beetle, son continues to drive. All else similar to 1) above

3) sell Beetle, get son a reliable $5K vehicle. Wife continues to drive Saturn, I drive Focus, get daughter a new, inexpensive (<$13-15K) new car with auto transmission.

4) variation of 3) above, except we simply pay off Beetle and son continues to drive it.

Somewhere along the line, there will be at least one car bought in the next few months -- whether it is a new car for the wife or a new car for the daughter remains to be seen. Possibility of buying a new (used) car for the son, if we decide to take advantage of the equity in the Beetle."
1336	October 11, 2004 4:23PM	anonymousposts	I wouldn't buy my 16 year old child a new car because it is bound to get a few dings, scratches, and scrapes. This may not be true in all cases but I would say it is true in most cases. That's why the Saturn would make sense for your daughter. She learned to drive in it and with the plastic panels it will not be as prone to scratches and bruises. New cars depreciate enough on their own without help from school parking lot dings and misc. mishaps.
1337	October 11, 2004 5:07PM	akangl	Oh its fast alright, I love mine. One drive and he'll be hooked. My hubby prefers the Titan over his Ram 3500 V10, says its a better driving truck and its faster.

I told hubby he has to keep it until the end of the ESC (about another year) and pay it down then send it down retail road if it keeps being a problem child. Sucks because the truck is awesome for what he needs it for and I don't freak about dings and dents since its 6 years old.

Ah well, it keeps this up and a diesel 1-ton will be in our future next year. I'm glad I'm happy with my 2 vehicles, now if we could get him something reliable we'd be all set."

As for steering boxes, I've only had two experiences with replacing them. I had both the power steering pump and the steering box replaced in my '68 Dart, back in late 1997. I got used parts, for about $150, and the mechanic charged another ~$150 to put them in.

Back in early '99, the Firestone shop tried to tell me that my '89 Gran Fury needed a new steering box. It didn't, and to be honest, that thing was as tight at 118,000 miles when I finally quit driving it, as my Intrepid was the day I bought it! Still, they quoted me $500."

1364	October 14, 2004 2:48PM	andre1969	"is what Rack and Pinion replaced. Basically it's just the thing that connects the steering wheel to the suspension, and contains the gears.

Rack and pinion is usually more precise, but I think the older recirculating ball type (which has the steering box) is beefier. But then that may just come from the fact that rack and pinion started off being common in smaller, cheaper, lighter cars. I think the Ford Pinto was one of the first cars in the US to have it."
1365	October 14, 2004 3:14PM	driftracer	"has a regular old-style steering box - a box full of gears, mounted on the driver's side front frame rail, where the steering shaft terminates.

1) Volvo V50 T5 AWD - yes, it's a wagon, and yes, it's based on the Mazda 3/new (euro-only) Focus platform, but it's fast, it's got AWD, and it can haul the freight. I'm quite curious as to whether I can fit in it -- I never could with the old S40/V40

2) Saab 9-2x Aero - I know, it's just a Subaru with a different face and a higher price tag, but you cannot, to my knowledge, get the WRX with leather and/or a sunroof. Both of these are high on my wife's ""gotta have"" list. I've driven the WRX before, but this time I'm gonna try it with the auto tranny -- maybe it'll make a difference.

Update on the Beetle -- talked with son #1 earlier this week, and he's OK with the idea of a new (used) car. So, wife says that if I want to go through the hassle of selling it, I can.

The car needs a serious detailing, both inside and out. I've posted a message in RWTIV and will be curious as to where Terry pegs the value."

Perhaps the part is updated, and this is simply what passes for as good as it gets over at DaimlerChrysler. Doing a little Googling, there is an aftermarket box available, and some have had luck installing a box from a 1-ton Ram, but I doubt your ESC would even allow you to pay the difference for the better parts.

1378	October 16, 2004 4:28AM	hammen2	"My GTO is still in the shop (day 21 - after 49 days of ownership), and will be for a few more days. Dealer fixed the front end clunking - changed a bunch of parts relating to the stabilizer bar/driver's side control arm. Of course, a couple of days before taking it in, the speedo went nuts and pegged at 200 mph as I was doing 40 down the road (and last week, the temp gauge pegged when I left work for lunch). The passenger-side door lock jammed in the ""up"" position, precluding the alarm system from activating (and resulting in much swearing and gnashing of teeth, including setting off said alarm). And, on the way to the dealer, the original styrofoam/squeaking noise from the dash returned. Dealer calls me today and tells me that it was the transmission mounts, which need to be replaced!

For those keeping score: TSB (rear suspension bolts) changed for clunking in the rear end/driveline impacting the body; having to re-glue/re-assemble the firewall (those 2 repairs took two weeks and necessitated removing the windshield twice), plus all of the above issues. Also the car had several paint flaws, including the ones that the dealer did to the car while working on it (and did a lousy job touching up). Also broke my steering wheel by not properly reassembling it, necessitating replacement of the back half. In the process of repairing the firewall, they (purposely) bent my strut-tower brace, which they have replaced.

Car has 1450 miles on it, and frankly, I hope they can't fix it, or that something else breaks on it as soon as I get it back. I follow GTO discussions on other boards, and, other than the TSB issue and the dash gauge issue (something funky relating to LHD and a wiring harness chafing against the glovebox - where the dash would be on a RWD car), no one else is reporting these problems. I either got a real lemon (even if it's purple, not yellow) or something happened to the car en route and it was repaired (not too well). Or incompetent dealer (front-end clunk wasn't present until they worked on the car, dropping and realigning the engine and tranny cradles in an attempt to track down the firewall flex noise).

The local Pontiac zone rep is a friend of a co-worker. I'm trying to get to talk to him to express my frustration at this whole scenario - I have no confidence in this particular vehicle, and would prefer a replacement. I know that's not how GM tends to handle these situations, though. I've ""heard"" that they offer 100k mi. warranties on situations like these, but I'd really rather just have a replacement GTO.

Getting back to CCB, I'm now driving a rental 2005 Grand Prix - had all of 15 miles on it when I picked it up, now 200 (and about 250-300 miles to put on this weekend). The Grand Prix makes a good rental car, if I might say so myself (we just traded my wife's 2001 GTP, which, IMHO, was a much better looking car from the outside - inside, both are equally junky/plastic-looking. Car doesn't seem that much different, really, for being redesigned last year. At least it's not the Sunfire they threatened to put me into :-)

On my '68 Dart, sometimes the temp gauge and fuel gauge (they're side by side) would peg all the way to the right or left. So either you were running cold and out of gas, or had a full tank and overheating!"

If I want to go all the way cheap I could probably find a 90 Civic wagon AWD. Or we could just drive slower and get a great set of snow tires. But we could also get sent to Miami and not need anything. We are pretty much in the wait-and-see mode right now.

It's a 1974 Imperial LeBaron hardtop coupe. This year the car was little more than a New Yorker with standard everything, and hidden headlights (the NYer would get them for '76) They only built 3850 of these hardtop coupes this year, and surprisingly, the 440 V-8 actually put out 230 hp that year! The year before it was ""only"" 215, and in '75 it dropped back down again to 215.

It looks like it's in pretty good shape, except for some minor rust coming through at the bottom of the rear quarter panels, and a bit on the passenger-side rocker. Interior looks almost perfect, except for some distortion of the C-pillar padding on the inside. Leather looks good, no dashboard cracks, the package shelf isn't even faded!

I'm almost tempted to go make them an offer, but I hate to think what the fuel economy would be on something like this! My '79 NYer, which only has a 360, and probably weighs about a thousand pounds less, only gets around 10-12 around town, although it did break 20 once, on the highway (a fluke, I'm sure!)

I have no idea what they want for it, though. I'm sure a heckuva lot more than it's really worth!"
1385	October 17, 2004 6:34PM	nippononly	"I'm curious - what WOULD a car like that be worth? And is that 230 hp SAE net, like today's figures? I forget when they changed over.

I had a friend in high school who had a car just like that. I borrowed it from time to time, and it had this weird design that the horn was on the inside of the steering wheel rim, so I would honk it by accident all the time.

Gas is getting a bit expensive to have a 10-mpg round-towner, but they sure don't make 'em like that any more - I kinda like the uniqueness of it. :-)"
1386	October 17, 2004 6:50PM	kyfdx	That would be net HP.. They switched over in '72.
1387	October 17, 2004 8:42PM	andre1969	"what it would really be worth. Shifty said around $2000-2500 would be about right for one in ""fair"" condition. I tried to look online, and found one price guide that had pricing of $2400/4200/6500/7600 for conditions classified as ""fair/good/excellent/show"".

I thought about maybe offering them $2500 for it. Normally I don't like brown cars, but for some reason, I think Chryslers and Pontiacs from the 70's and early 80's seem to carry it off well. Another thing I like about this one is that it's still a true hardtop in that you can roll down the rear windows. By that time a lot of them had optional opera window packages and landau tops that gave you a little fixed rear window surrounded by overdone vinyl padding. While this one does have a vinyl roof, I think the pillarless design looks nice, clean, and uncluttered. Another thing I like about Chryslers from this era is they gave you a few extra gauges, so it's like they were at least making a small attempt to cater to the driver, as opposed to a passenger who happens to be sitting behind the wheel! Most big cars by this time just had a fuel gauge and speedo (although a gauge package was a common option on big Pontiacs), but this one also had a temp and amp gauge."
1388	October 17, 2004 8:47PM	andre1969	"that was 230 net. In inflated gross hp terms, it would probably be around 300 or so. When they did the switch from gross to net in '72, the Imperial went from 335 hp to 225 hp, although they also might have cut the compression ratio that year, as well, and done other things to make a real hp loss, in addition to the ""paper"" loss.

And here's something I don't understand...the Imperial was Chrysler's flagship, supposed to compete with Lincolns and Caddies. Well, my old car book lists a 275 hp 440 as an option on the New Yorkers that year, but NOT the Imperial! You'd think that they'd offer the most potent engine on their flagship!

But to be fair, 230 hp was probably enough to keep it competitive. Cadillac was only getting 205 hp out of its 472, and only 210 out of the 500 CID Eldorado engine. And Lincoln's 460 only put out 215 hp in the Continental coupe/sedan, and 220 in the mammoth Mark IV."

Maybe it's just me, but when I spend upward of $30K for an automobile, I expect it to perform as it was designed to do. If not, I would hope to find an amicable resolution. I guess that was my overall point here.

I usually scope out a car in advance of purchase, and for me, that is a big part of the ultimate ownership experience. I may be mechanically challenged, but that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy the total car experience.

While I've never owned a new car with problems like hammen2 is having, I have found a top notch sales and service dealership that I have the utmost confidence in doing right by me. It also helps that the dealership's GM is my neighbor!"

Back in 2000, someone tried to break into my '00 Intrepid at Six Flags America. On the passenger side, they pulled the door handle loose and were trying to get in through there. As a result, I needed a new door handle, the sheetmetal itself had to be straightened, and they repainted the door, and replaced the ""D-O-D-G-E"" lettering, instead of trying to paint around it. Total bill came to around $425 or so, of which I had to pay $250. They did an excellent job, and even now, 4 years later, it hasn't faded.

truthfully though, I would've been just as happy if they could have just shoved the handle back in (I tried, but couldn't do it...in fact, that might have been what caused the dent), and left the dent. As it was, I couldn't see the dent, anyway..."

But, Saturday night the wife and I stopped at the local Ford dealership and checked out the Freestyle. Ford may have something here. Slightly smaller than the Pacifica, it has more than enough room on the inside and has some nice lines on the outside. Wife commented that it ""looked like a Jimmy"" - I think she was referring to the C-pillar shape and slope.

Driving it was a pleasant experience, too. The CVT takes a bit of time to get used to, but the car has enough get-up-and-go power for the wife.

They had 2 of them on the lot, both Limiteds, with leather and pretty much loaded, for $33K. As I qualify for the Ford X-plan pricing, I should be able to get it for close to invoice, if that is the direction we decide to go in."

The Intrepid would usually get around 20 in that type of driving, and by that time, gasoline was only up to around $1.59 a gallon, at its peak.

I have a feeling that if I was still delivering pizzas today though, I'd either quit and try to find another part time job that didn't require use of my car, or I'd be driving something small and fuel-efficient! I do remember adding up my total fuel receipts one month, back in 1996. I think it came out to around $300. That included ALL driving though, not just pizza delivery.

Couple nights later, an Alero was broken into to when sitting on the dealer lot for body work; broke a window and the stereo, which they did not get, was heavily damaged, as was the dashboard.

Tell the truth, you called in sick to go to the car lots. Seriously, going to work sick bites. Last year I was about 5 months pregnant when I came down with a severe cold. I forced myself to go to work because if I didn't I would have three times as much to do when I got back between things that weren't done and things that had been done incorrectly.

I added up last month's gas charges and they came up to $260. This will go down significantly when gee quits work at the end of this month.

On a different note, does anyone remember that movie ""Better Off Dead"" with John Cusack in it? He was dumped by his girlfriend and driving a hoopty station wagon when he met a French exchange student who helped him fix up his 60-something Camaro and beat the guy who had taken his girlfriend away in a skiing race. That was a NICE Camaro. Nice enough that I still remember it to this day even though I was only 8 or so when the movie came out."

When dropping my car off for service, the GTP was sitting ready for the new owner, and it was a beaut. This happened in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Route 1. Very disturbing, but the local papers are reporting an increase in thefts from construction sites, as well as break ins of both businesses and homes.

There also seems to be more moving violation incidents reported where cars stopped for minor problems (headlight/taillight out, that type of thing) result in the arrest of the driver and/or passenger for using/running/selling drugs. But I figured alot of that would stop now that the summer party season is over. I'm beginning to wonder if there is a connection."
1412	October 18, 2004 9:33PM	michaellno	"Ouch! You were 8 when that movie came out?

""Better Off Dead"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. The Camaro is either a '67 or a '68, and the ending credits are filmed at Dodger Stadium.

There are two lines that stand out for me in that movie. The first is when our protagonist, in an attempt to kill himself, falls off a bridge and into the open pit of a garbage truck. It drives by a couple of homeless guys, one of whom says something on the order of:

""Well, lookee here. Somebody threw away a perfectly good white guy.""

The second is when he and his buddy are at the top of the ski slope. The buddy, who is a notorious drug user, inhales a handful of the snow and exclaims:

""Dude, this is pure snow! Do you know what the street value of this mountain is?""

Bonus trivia question: in that movie, John Cusak drag races some Asian brothers, once in the station wagon, the other time after the Camaro is put together. What was the car the brothers drove?

Hmm, monthly gas charges. Well, I figure about $20/week for the Focus, and $28-30/week for the Saturn, so probably $200/month or thereabouts."
1413	October 18, 2004 10:16PM	andre1969	"I might fill up my Intrepid about every 10 days to 2 weeks. Usually takes about $27-30 to fill it up. The NYer, pickup, and Catalina don't get driven much, but I do have a bad habit of running one till it's almost empty, then another, and then another, so I end up having to fill 'em all up at once! The pickup's not too bad, because it only has a 16 gallon tank on either side. It tends to like 89 octane, though. The NYer's worse. Preference for 89 octane, and a larger 21 gallon tank. It's not hard to spend $40 on a fillup. The Catalina's the worst though. It'll actually run on 87 octane without complaining, but I KNOW that can't be right. 400 4bbl, fairly high compression, I'm sure it really needs something a bit more. So I usually put at least 89 in. The real killer though, is that its gas tank is around 26-27 gallons. So a fill up can easily top 50 bucks!

In theory, if I only drove to and from work with the Intrepid, I could go a long time between fill-ups. There's a gas station and grocery store along the way, and my commute is only about 7 miles a day. In that kind of driving, fuel economy would be about 20 mpg. It has a 17 gallon tank, but it would be kinda dumb to run it dry! ;-) So, say I run it until it has about 2 gallons left. That'd be 300 miles@20mpg. 300/7 is what, about 43 work days. So in theory, I could go about 9 weeks between fillups. Of course, that would be a really boring life, staying home on weekends, never going anywhere but to work, etc. And playing on the internet can be fun, but there is a real world out there, somewhere! ;-)"
1414	October 18, 2004 10:50PM	michaellno	"Let's break it down:

My commute is ~32-35 miles one way, so approximately 65-70 miles r/t. 5 days a week give us 325-350 miles. The gas tank on the Focus is only 12.5 gallons, and I don't think I've ever put more than 11.5 gallons in at once. My calculations show that I'm getting 29-31 mpg. So, if I do no other driving other than to/from work, I can get 5 round trips to a tank of gas.

The Saturn has a 15 gallon tank, but the wife's commute is only about 15 miles one way. So, a week's worth of commuting gives us about 150 miles. The average MPG on the Saturn is 24-25 (although I did just get almost 29 on a trip to and around the mountains a couple of weeks ago!), so in theory we could get a couple of weeks of commuting to a tank. However, it's at least 5 miles one way to the closest shopping of any sort from our house, so even errand running can drain the tank pretty quickly. Ergo, we fill the tank up on the Saturn about once a week as well."

1433	October 20, 2004 12:46PM	anonymousposts	Sometimes I ask myself why we have both the Odyssey and the Accord. Well, today I remembered why we have two baby carriers with LATCH. Had to drop the Accord off for service on monday and having the Odyssey prevented us from having to pile into the Si with the baby and use the gas-guzzling LS to commute in. And today when we pick the Accord up we are going to drop the Odyssey off for a recall.

The Titan is going in to have the rear suspension fixed in a couple weeks, that should just be a 1 day thing.

The Ram is also going in to possibly have the instrument cluster replaced due to the oil pressure guage. Once it goes in it can't leave because when they order the cluster the mileage has to be set at the factory to avoid having a TMU vehicle. Also they have to check it to see why it has blue smoke on start up and its burning more oil now than it was, plus the fog lights quit working. So it will be down for a while, hubby will go to using the Titan for logging *cringe*. I will still have the Focus to drive (which needs to go in too, but will have to wait a little bit).

Course 3 vehicles is a handful to keep up with, 14 winter tires, 3 oil changes, need to winterize the Focus, need to change the rear diff fluid in the Titan, and front and rear in the Ram. I need to keep a log somewhere of who had what done when."
1436	October 20, 2004 3:29PM	anonymousposts	"The Titan's rear suspension needs work already? The instrument cluster in your Dodge is messed up and the fog lights quit working AND it's burning oil? Not to mention the door on your Focus is misaligned and it's having a starting problem? Man you have bad car luck.

Just curious how much it has cost you to buy the snow tires and ""winterize"" your vehicles. Seems like it's a pretty hefty expense."
1437	October 20, 2004 6:00PM	akangl	"The Titan has squeaky rear suspension, the tech says there's a fix for it now, not biggie, just a glitch. The Focus has always had a starting issue, its just getting worse and the door, well, its a 2-dr so that may be why, that and the horrible roads up here shaking the car to death.

As for the Ram, well, its a Dodge.......'nuff said.

Now the winter tires cost $100 for the Focus (bought used), $652 for 4 Bridgestone blizzak winter duelers on the Titan plus $621 for the 17"" wheels, and the Dodge was $857 for 6 Cooper Discoverer M&S studded snow tires. That's a grand total of $2230.

Winterization will cost about $100 for the Focus since its already got a block heater which is the most expensive part. The trucks are already done."
1438	October 20, 2004 9:24PM	anonymousposts	"$2300 is pretty steep. Averaged out over 12 months that's like an extra $200 on top of your car payments. If the roads are bad enough to cause your door to misalign I definitely think it's time for you to move

Well, Gee received his 19"" flat screen monitor today. I haven't heard him this excited in a while."
1439	October 20, 2004 9:42PM	driftracer	or several other cold weather states. When you live down South, you have to buy a boat and waterski equipment, or a fishing boat, so it averages out...
1440	October 20, 2004 9:54PM	anonymousposts	"No boats for us. No waterskis either. Neither one of us like water too much. I can sit and look at the ocean all day but when it comes to actually getting in .. that's OK. I'd rather be out buying a car.

For those of you who do live in the snow belt ... is AWD necessary? Would you take a great handling car/van with no AWD or would you take a car that didn't handle as well but had AWD?"
1441	October 20, 2004 9:58PM	driftracer	"not enough of a confidence builder to make you do stupid stunts, but enough to make you feel good about your family cruising around during bad weather.

Other than wanting a truck, and having a pretty good need for a truck, my primary reason for getting a 4WD truck is so I don't have to worry (as much) about my wife getting to work or the store."
1442	October 20, 2004 9:59PM	anonymousposts	I was just curious. If we do get moved northward we have 3 FWD cars and one RWD car. Just trying to see if my decision should take into account I may have to trade on of the vehicles (though it could not be the Accord or Odyssey because they are leases).
1443	October 20, 2004 10:01PM	jlawrence01	"I can't speak for Alaska or other states where you have some serious mountains but ...

Here in Chicago in the great flatlands, I do NOT think that AWD or 4WD is necessary. What I DO think is ESSENTIAL are good tires, in good condition with plenty of tread left. They do not have to be snow tires. I also like FWD over RWD.

My brother used to run a school bus service and we would take his Dodge Omni all over the city testing how slick the hills were after a major storm. That was a blast.

One more thing. Discretion is the better part of valor. In my old age, I find myself staying at home for major storms rather than playing Russian roulette with a bunch of SUV-driving idiots who insist on driving 60 mph in 45 mph zones during a winterstorm.

Off the doapbox."

I've always thought that those who say ""I have to have AWD to drive safely in inclement weather"" are the same ones who will probably end up causing a majority of accidents because they are driving too fast for conditions based on a false idea that AWD will save their hineys."
1445	October 20, 2004 10:23PM	akangl	"My FWD Focus does pretty good on slick roads, but I felt VERY safe in my 4WD Titan yesterday. It handled the icy, nasty roads perfectly. I'm driving the Focus to work in the morning and the roads are still evil, so we'll see.

FWD, 4WD, AWD, RWD, they all seem to manage up here, my hubby drove a 2WD F-150 for 9 1/2 years with no trouble......didn't even use snow tires."

Next time you're on the freeway in nasty weather, check it out. A disproportionate number of vehicles off the road are some sort of 4x4.

1447	October 21, 2004 12:30AM	akangl	Not only that but as a general rule they are running some all season or all terrain tire since the popular belief is that if you have 4WD you don't need winter tires. We learned the hard way that there is no substitute for a dedicated winter tire.
1448	October 21, 2004 9:19AM	andyman73	"I recall my dad speaking of an incident several years ago. He was going up a moderately steep hill following a woman in a new Scooby, spinning all 4 wheels drifting back and forth, as she moved up the hill. He followed patiently, some distance back, in his 89 Dodge Ram conversion van. You know the rwd type.

I have never run snow tires, not for lack of want, but then again, don't run ""summertires"", either. I have found that patience always works, especially if you practice it. Perhaps some day I will be able to spring for a set of snows, and see what a difference a day makes.

BTW great John Cusack movie, also check out Grosse Point Blank, for a diverse selection of autos, nice Beemer, and a big Lincoln."
1449	October 21, 2004 2:08PM	kyfdx	"You definitely DON'T need AWD in the snow belt. FWD is a big help, but the biggest help of all is winter tires..

You could move north in the cars you have, and never have to worry about it.. The LS might have to stay home on really bad days, and if your SI has performance rubber, it might need winter tires, but that is about it.

1450	October 21, 2004 3:38PM	gee35coupe	WOW....I'm really pondering looking at considering thinking about selling the LS.
1451	October 21, 2004 3:42PM	kyfdx	How much gas does it use, sitting in the garage? I mean, unless the spiders are driving it...
1452	October 21, 2004 3:50PM	driftracer	"Again, I'll mention that in 1981, in oil-supplied Texas, I paid $1.56 a gallon for premium in my motorcycle, $1.38 for regular in my car. I was making $4.00 an hour, minimum wage was $2.90 (or $3.35, I can't remember).

Now, I make $100 an hour, work 20 hours a week, and pay $2.21 for premium - I know people love to complaint, but I don't see a problem with the differential between now and 23 years ago.

What I DO have a problem with is the fact that I paid .79 cents a gallon for unleaded in 1999 - 5 years ago - explain that one to me....

I'm buying a big diesel truck, which will get as good or better mileage than my PT Cruiser GT, and will have a better turning radius, despite being a crew cab.

I'll also be buying a hot rod this spring, either an EVO or STi..amd they aren't know for exceptional fuel mileage. And the bike I'm buying gets only 32 mpg, less when you're in a wheelie....but I'm not throwing away the Huyabusa idea because a commuter bike gets better mileage.

I'm 40 years old and don't fit the EVO demographic, but I think I can afford one better than the average 25 year old tech intern. I wanted a Corvette at 25, but couldn't afford the payments or insurance. I can now. I'll be danged if I'll settle for a car I don't want because of fuel prices, especially when, in comparison, I paid twice as much when I was in high school as I do now."
1453	October 21, 2004 3:58PM	kyfdx	"Yeah.. but you are comparing it to the most expensive time in history.. In '77, I was paying under $0.60 for Regular...

It is still relatively cheap, but 70% increases in less than two years are hard to swallow..

And, the distance of your commute really matters.. ten miles or less one-way and its not much of a difference.. but 20-50 miles one-way, and it really starts to add up..

regards,
kyfdx"
1454	October 21, 2004 4:08PM	gee35coupe	But it's gonna be a very hard sell if I DO decide to sell it if gas hits $2.50. $60 fill-ups would hurt.
1455	October 21, 2004 4:10PM	andre1969	"for most of my life, I've never had to commute very far. High school was about 5 miles away. College was about 10. And then I had a part time job that was only about 2-3 miles from the campus, but then on weekends, and going home at nite, that would put it 12-13 miles from home. My full-time job was only about 3 1/2 miles away.

Then I moved. It was about 13-14 miles to go from my home to my full-time job, then about 9 to get out to the part time job, and then around 22 to get home (I took a different way home which was a lot quicker at nite).

Then, for awhile I delivered pizzas, and THAT could rack up the miles really fast, and on a few times I'd burn through a tank of gas in one night. But through most of that time period, gas was cheap, around $1.00-1.25 a gallon. And I could write off around 30 cents a mile on my taxes, so it helped offset it. And as soon as I got a fairly fuel-efficient car, gas prices shot up, and seemed bad at the time, but looking back, that $1.50-1.60 a gallon I was paying back in 2000 seemed dirt cheap to the $2.00 or so it is now.

But anyway, now I'm back to 3.5 miles to work. One job, and not much driving. So I'm really not too concerned about what gas prices go up to. Except that it does hurt the economy, stock market, drives up other prices, etc. Not that long ago, I was paying around $2.60-2.70 a gallon for milk. Earlier in the year it shot up to $4.00 for awhile! Now it's back to around the $3.00 range, but sometimes at Costco you can get it for around $2.50.

But now if I had a long commute to work, I'd definitely make fuel economy a priority in getting a new car. It wouldn't make me get rid of any of my antique cars, but for a daily driver I'd probably try for something more fuel efficient."
1456	October 21, 2004 7:23PM	michaellno	"I agree. We specifically got rid of the Explorer and got the Focus last November for just that reason. Not to mention the car payment went down by more than $200, the fuel bill has been cut in half (16-17MPG for the Explorer vs. the 30-32MPG the Focus gets).

In looking for the wife's new car, we have been focusing more on MPG than we might normally. In addition, one of the cars on the short list (Outback XT) takes premium fuel and the wife isn't too thrilled about that.

Just paid $2.14/gal for 87 (mid-grade) this morning.

gee: $60 fill-ups? My sister and BIL got a GMC Denali earlier this year and they live in San Diego. I gotta believe it's costing them $75-80 per tank. And, it's the family truckster -- my BIL has a leased G35 that he commutes to/from work in. Not like the part-time Lexus."

I didn't think they sold GM products in California. At least Autoextremist.com doesn't think so."
1458	October 21, 2004 11:47PM	anonymousposts	"""WOW....I'm really pondering looking at considering thinking about selling the LS.""

Now do you all see what I have to put up with. On top of the endless diaper changes, clothing changes, feedings, and baths I have to listen to the ""I'm gonna sell the Lexus"" line almost daily. And then there's the baby ........

""How much gas does it use, sitting in the garage? I mean, unless the spiders are driving it...

Hilarious."
1459	October 22, 2004 1:36AM	akangl	Took me nearly 2 hours to get home. I just love working 85 miles from home, its so much fun. The Focus does ok in the snow, didn't seem to have too much issue with slushy, slick, nasty roads.
1460	October 22, 2004 1:57AM	anonymousposts	Don't feel too bad. My commute is 35 miles and if I leave my job at 5:45 sometimes I don't make it home until 7:00. Mornings are about the same. With no traffic though I can make it in 45 minutes. .
1461	October 22, 2004 6:08AM	nippononly	"question for you Chicago people: is it mandatory to switch to winter tires at that time of year, or will FWD with good all-seasons and careful driving suffice? Looking to give advice to someone who is just about to move to the burbs over there (Evanston, I believe).

So what's with all the new cars going to premium fuel nowadays? Not just luxury models, but regular ones too. Just noticed that ALL the new Toyota Tacomas require premium - definitely puts a damper on thoughts of buying a new truck. My nearest gas station is a Shell, currently has 91 octane (our highest grade) running at $2.79/gallon. Yes, that is self-serve.

Like the look of the new Dakota too, and the fact that you can get the lower power V-8 with a (six speed!) manual, but then there was that post above, something to the effect of ""it's to be expected (numerous problems) - it's a Dodge"". Just can't win! :-("
1462	October 22, 2004 12:01PM	hammen2	Of course, you know the perfect ending to the CCB saga of gee's Lexus would be if he sold it to akangl :-)
1463	October 22, 2004 12:08PM	jlawrence01	"I use the same tires in the winter as in the summer. I buy the 55k mile Futuras over at Pep Boys for $160-180 OTD and be done with it. I will admit that I change tires every third winter even though they still have a lot of tread left on them.

I don't use premium but it is available for $2.05 at Sam's Club here in Crystal Lake."
1464	October 22, 2004 12:19PM	hammen2	"I'm from the Milwaukee area (about 85 miles north of Chicago), so hopefully I can chime in here. I've lived the Milwaukee area, the Chicago 'burbs, and also the Twin Cities. I've never had an AWD or 4WD vehicle (except for the wife's Envoy we just got) and I've done just fine in winters. Of course, if the weather is bad, I just don't go anywhere I don't absolutely have to (and, unlike others, I tend to wait for after rush-hour to commute home, because I'd rather face worse roads that are relatively empty than have to share bad roads with idiots). The real key is tires. I've never put dedicated winter snow tires on any of my vehicles (which have been predominantly FWD). As long as you have decent all-seasons, AND DON'T DRIVE LIKE AN IDIOT (i.e. pay attention to traction, allow for plenty of distance, start stopping way early, et. al.), you will do fine. RWD is a different story - if I wanted to drive my GTO for the winter, I'd be getting dedicated winter snow tires. The car will soon be sleeping until April in a heated storage facility...

Regarding premium gas... this is a result of the continuing horsepower wars, and the need for higher-compression engines to get more HP. I don't know about other states, but here in the Midwest, premium gas has a 15-20 cent premium over regular (tends to be higher at the bigger-name stations like Amoco, Mobil, and Shell, tends to be less at the Clark and Citgo stations). How much more it costs depends on your MPG and how many miles per year you drive. Let's assume 20 mpg and 15k/year. That's 750 gallons of gas burned each year. At a 15c premium, that's $112.50 per year. Less than $10/mo. For me personally, that's not a big deal and it's not going to stop me from picking the vehicle/engine that I'd like.

Frankly, most people will waste more than that in not doing their research/getting a good deal on the vehicle they buy, or in obtaining the best finance rate they can (i.e. getting approved by a local bank or credit union before walking into the dealership). Not to mention the issues of maintenance (changing a fuel filter, cleaning injectors, keeping tire pressure accurate, changing plugs and wires when it's time), which may cost that much in gas (less optimal mileage) in a year's time. And then there's folks like a former co-worker of mine, who used to frequently keep pushing the gas pedal down about 1/4 then lifting off it as we rolled down the freeway, instead of using the cruise or just holding his foot on the pedal and maintaining speed...

--Robert"
1465	October 22, 2004 2:32PM	anonymousposts	"The new Tacome requires premium? That bites. I like the look of it. However they get up close to $28,000 or more with options and for that kind of money I would rather have a full-size.

hammen: For that to happen gee would actually have to SELL his Lexus (ain't happenin) and akangl would have to leave mooseland for a day (don't think that's happenin either). Besides, a RWD luxury car doesn't seem as if it would be the best choice to drive in the Alaskan climate. I'm beginning to think people up there need to drive tanks."
1466	October 22, 2004 3:06PM	kyfdx	Was $2.15 today... In Cincinnati..
1467	October 22, 2004 3:46PM	anonymousposts	Our regular is $1.96 right now so premium would be $2.16. Usually GA has some of the cheapest gas but that does not appear to be true any more. We are REALLY glad we got rid of our gas-guzzling GS300 which we used to commute in. It would get around 19 MPG usually. That would get expensive considering how far we drive sometimes just to go grocery shopping.
1468	October 22, 2004 5:37PM	nippononly	"I am still going to check out the Tacoma, since it is new. It might be one of those situations where it will run on regular, but just will not deliver the advertised power ratings at that octane. If that is the case then fine, I will settle for 10 less hp to use the cheaper gas.

The Tacoma V-6 4x4 double cab/SB runs $24,5 sticker. Add the very cool TRD off-road package (upsized tires, locking rear diff, Bilsteins with disconnecting front sway bar, towing package, tons of baubles like skid plates and rear 400A 115V A/C power point) and it gets to $28K, but I figure wait six months and it will be going for 25. Juicy prospect!

The Dakota Hemi is rated at like 230 hp and 290 lb-ft(minus ten and plus ten respectively vs the Tacoma) but only comes with the automatic, which I figure is the major pitfall to avoid in a Chrysler group truck. You can get the 6-speed with the lower output V-8 though.

I like the both of them and will be checking them out shortly. CCB jaw dripping here...deep breaths..."
1469	October 22, 2004 5:47PM	andre1969	"isn't a Hemi. It's actually their 4.7 OHC V-8, which was designed to replace the old 5.2/318. For the Dakota, it comes in two outputs: 230/250 hp and 290/300 ft-lb of torque.

I know the older 4-speed automatic that they used in RWD applications used to be pretty troublesome, but is that still the case with the newer 5-speed automatics they're using?"
1470	October 22, 2004 6:09PM	nippononly	"yeah, I knew that, I don't know why I said Hemi...

I don't want an automatic anyway, stick only! And the power differential between these two V-8s is so small that I am not quite sure why they bothered. Now if it had a 350 hp Hemi under that hood, THAT would be worth the trouble! :-)

I don't get it, the JGC AND the Durango both get the Hemi, and yet somehow it just doesn't work out for the Dakota? My bet is the Dakota will see more heavy duty use than either of those other two."
1471	October 22, 2004 6:16PM	andre1969	"if they've just run out of Hemi engines, and couldn't build enough to allocate to the Dakota? I have a feeling that the Hemi will find its way into the Dakota, eventually!

I'm wondering what's going on with the two 4.7's, as well. I wonder if the 250 hp version might have a much broader hp/torque curve than the 230 hp version? So there might actually be more of an improvement in performance than what the hp/torque numbers suggest.

Chrysler did something similar in the 1998-01 Intrepids. The base model just came with a 2.7 V-6 with 200 hp and 190 ft-lb of torque. The ES model came standard with a 2.7 that had 202 hp and 195 (IIRC) ft-lb. Sounds like it's not worth it, but the ES had a variable intake runner that really helped out with the torque, giving you much more torque at lower rpms, although by the time you hit the peak, the difference was marginal.

Overall though, it was enough to knock about 7/10 of a second off the base 2.7's 0-60 time. For 2002 though, they just did the right thing, and ditched the variable intake 2.7 (and the 3.2) and put in a standard 3.5, which knocked about another second off 0-60.

Still, while that 250 hp 4.7 might be a bigger improvement than the numbers might suggest, they really NEED to put a Hemi in there!!"
1472	October 22, 2004 8:22PM	ghulet	"....sorry I'm chiming in a bit late here. First, let me state that the winters the last few years absolutely pale in comparison to when I was a kid (Blizzard of '79, etc.), but then or now, we've never changed tires specifically due to season. We've had FWD and 4x4 cars for the past fifteen years or so, but even when I had old RWD cars with not-so-great tires, I've only been really, seriously stuck in snow once. I think just driving prudently, avoiding places and situations and taking one's time in questionable conditions goes a lot farther than winter tires, at least in urban or suburban areas. YMMV.

That said, my mom and stepdad live in a collar suburb of Indianapolis, have two older RWD cars and a steep driveway, which has made them virtually immobile during a few snows. I'm trying to get them into at least one FWD, but they seem convinced that keeping an old Benz on the road is more financially prudent than buying a newer car, so what to do?"
1473	October 23, 2004 1:09AM	andyman73	I just want to relay an experience I had, about 10 years ago, I used my Lincoln T/C to push a friend's Puegeot out of the snow he was stuck in. I had Michelin XOnes on, I think 65K mile touring, either M&S or all season. Just a little point of interest. The only time I had trouble in that Lincoln, in snow or ice, once they had some glazing on top of the snow covered roads. I couldn't make it up the hill to my folks drive. I turned from a intersecting street, there for loosing my momentum, and couldn't fight the weight of the car. Just backed down, went around the block, and made it just fine. If it had an LSD, that would have made the difference. My 85 325e had an LSD, and it was great in the snow.
1474	October 23, 2004 1:11AM	akangl	Buying NOTHING, nope, not gonna happen. Gotta pay off the toys we have. Got the wheels in motion to put dual exhaust on the Titan. Drove it to work today, what an awesome truck on the bad roads, sure love that truck.

One of my neighbors has a black Titan, they just love it! The only thing that would prevent me from getting one(if I was shopping), is I am Z plan qualified for Ford, and that would make the new F150 very tempting. Other than that, Titan would be my first choice."
1478	October 23, 2004 1:30AM	anonymousposts	"The good part about leasing is that there is a definite end time to it. So until May 1, 2006 we can plan and plot knowing that we can't do anything. I refuse to let him get rid of his Civic. It's a great commuter that we only owe around $9000 on. It would be hard to get a less expensive replacement that would be as nice and new as the Si. It would also be hard to get a nicer car for anything in the $15,000 range that we paid for the Si. Sure the 3 is nice but neither of us like the driving position, they are hard to find with the options we would want, and Gee doesn't like the fact that the entire front end is surrounded by plastic. Gee doesn't fit in the Corolla and it's just not sporty enough to tell you the truth, Jettas scare both of us when it comes to reliability, etc. He does like the Accord coupe but then we are talking another $22,000. Considering the SI's primary purpose is as a commuter I don't think we can do better for the money.

I was watching MTV's True Life tonight and they had a show on a cross country road rally. Man that looks like fun. But I wouldn't be out there in a lowered RSX, Accord, Audi, VW, or Subaru. I'd take the Odyssey. 25 MPG, a DVD player, climate control, and more room than we know what to do with sounds like even more fun.

drift: It's normal to be excited about a new car. The new car hunt is the biggest part of the CCB thrill.

Working at a dealership I am always tempted. Even though I know there's probably nothing out there I would like more than what we currently have. Example: Right now I could get my hands on a 2000 RX300 with 60,000 miles for $13,000. Not a bad deal considering kbb.com private party is $19,900 and trade is $17,300.

In my case gee and I have 4 cars, two of which cost more than that BMW she was buying out of warranty and financed for 72 months at 13% interest. Never assume that your financial position is better than someone's else's just because of the type of vehicle they buy. I have seen doctors come in and buy Corollas, Civics, and even a Ford Focus. On the other hand I have seen people who make $30,000 a year buy a Lexus at 14% interest and finance it for 66-72 months."

Yeah.. see my post above.. Must be why I like it... Of course, I've been driving dorky CR-Vs for six years..

1505	October 25, 2004 7:34PM	ghulet	"...is the black rear bumper. Don't get me wrong, I think they're practical in keeping them looking newer (non-scuffed) and all, and in certain colors they're not totally unattractive. Considering even most low-priced cars and SUVs now have body-colored painted bumpers, they make the vehicle look cheap. That picture looks fine, but I've seen a few in person and the black bumpers make the car look $10k cheaper than it is. I wouldn't want a $30-40k car that looks like a CR-V or a Forester.

Kyfdx, see what a good job the auto industry has done in indoctrinating people with the SUV=good, wagon=bad brainwashing? Your wife is not unique, there are many people who will buy anything marketed as an SUV but nothing marketed as a wagon, regardless of their inherent similarities or the fact that the 'SUV' adds $5k in cost and virtually no practical benefit to most consumers. The Civic wagon sold poorly, but now that it's an 'SUV', its sales are quite impressive."
1506	October 25, 2004 7:39PM	kyfdx	"Yes.. the bumpers are definitely less noticeable in the dark colors, I have to agree.. Not my favorite look, either, but I'm used to it, since I've had two CR-Vs...

Even with the bumpers, it is miles better looking than either of those two, IMO.

I wouldn't be surprised to see body color bumpers in '06. It seems to be a sticking point for a lot of people. They have dropped the price of the 3.0 model by $3K or so for '05.. So, that will spur sales of that model... less overlap pricewise with the X5 now.

I'm growing to hate that stupid Focus, thing is HORRIBLE on bad roads. I'm driving the Titan more and more which is expensive, but dang that truck is the best on bad roads.

Started out yesterday morning with the Focus and the car was shaking so bad I could barely control it, so took it home, got the truck and went to work. Hubby took the car to work and thawed it out inside, had some ice caked in the rear wheels. That car has been nothing but trouble since winter hit. Needs to go in for the starting problem and the driver's side door. Great summer car, but no way its even decent in the winter.

Oh and NO, I'm not going to buy a new car........what were the bet dates again? I'm sure I've missed them by now."

You say at this moment you aren't thinking, but isn't winter like 9 months long in Alaska?

I think by the time the roads thaw and the Focus is ready to become the top choice...it will already be a distant memory. That is my thought.

I think you should seriously consider a Subaru Impreza for both the AWD and the better clearance/ride over a Focus, given your climate."
1515	October 26, 2004 6:27PM	akangl	"Why did I buy the Titan? Well, I drove the Ford and the Chevy, neither came close to the Titan in performance. The Titan was the best choice of the group, not to mention its different and you don't see your truck on every road. I don't regret buying it at all, its got first year hiccups, but we are slowly weeding through them.

As for the Focus, its a 2004, I wanted a 2005 but hubby wanted the big rebate on the 2004. We never agreed on the car, it was his deal, he likes the car, I don't. Not a big deal except I have to drive the car 1000 miles/week. Its a good car, reliable and decent to drive, just doesn't do well at all on bad roads."
1516	October 26, 2004 6:32PM	akangl	"I've had 2 Imprezas, didn't like either one of them. One was VERY quick to swap ends in the snow, the other well, it wasn't much better. I'll live with the Focus, only 6 more months of winter.

If I had to pick a car right now, it would either be a Subaru Outback or BMW 330xi or maybe a Pontiac Vibe. However, none of those are even a consideration in the near future. The Focus will be with us for a long time I'm afraid."
1517	October 26, 2004 6:50PM	corvette	I think I figured it out. It's kind of slab-sided and the greenhouse is way too tall in proportion to the rest of the car. And the thing with the taillights doesn't help. The X5 seems more in proportion to my eye.
1518	October 26, 2004 8:07PM	michaellno	"Found out that the BIL has traded in his leased Infiniti G35 for an '04 BMW 530i. Don't remember when he got the G35, so I don't know if the lease was coming due or what.

Gunmetal grey is the color -- I don't have any other details (auto/stick, other options, price paid, buy or lease).

Funny, the way the story was told, the BMW was their second choice. My sister vetoed the first choice (whatever it was, not a BMW or Infiniti) as it could not support 3 car seats (or 2 car seats and a booster - they have 3 kids, aged 7, 4 and 11 months)."
1519	October 27, 2004 1:19AM	anonymousposts	"akangl: I'm betting on February 16th as the day for your new car. There's too much tempation to be stuck with a car you hate. At least since you only paid around $10,000 for the Focus there can't be that much depreciation.

On the way home from our weekly grocery run we stopped by the Ford dealer to check out the new Freestyle. We loved the exterior and the interior was better than expected although we just looked through the windows. It will go on the list as a possible Odyssey/Accord replacement though Gee has some reservations;

1. It's a Ford
2. CVT transmission only right now
3. HP is kind of low compared to our Odyssey

On the positive side;

1. It looks good
2. Seemed roomy
3. AWD
4. There should be either incentives or 0.0% before too much longer.

michaell: The G35 came out for 2003 so at the oldest it is a little over 2 years. So he probably had a few months left on his lease. I don't see a 540 as a good choice if you have 3 kids though."

I told him I want a Pontiac Vibe or something like it that's AWD, he just said ""oh well, live with what you've got."" Sheesh, he's no fun.

As for depreciation on that car, well, its a Ford, so I'm sure on trade its worth no more than $4k-$5k and on the retail said *maybe* $7kish. I don't know, don't want to know, lol."

The wife and I drove the Freestyle a week or two ago and were pleasantly surprised. Acceleration was OK, just takes some getting used to the fact that there is no gear changing with the CVT.

jolie: ouch, the hubby's no fun at all! If you're that unhappy with the car, you ought to get rid of it ... I know you love it in the summer but if it doesn't get driven in the winter, what's the point? I thought you got the Focus to keep the miles down on the Titan. Gotta be costing you an arm and a leg for gas.

BTW, the Vibe is a great little car, but you have to rev the whee out of it to get any acceleration - the AWD version only comes with an automatic, which, to us, saps all the fun out of it. Besides that, it was pretty nice - quite roomy for it's size, in fact."

1524	October 27, 2004 3:53PM	racer63	"Been reading up everyone' CCBA tales, and think I'm eligible to be a member of the circle....here's my (really long) story:

1980 - 1972 Chevy Vega - Summer ride when I got license at 17, had been mother's car for 8(!) years. 'Bout the longest lived Vega on the planet. 80hp, 1 barrel carb, 3 on the floor, 2.53 rear, quart or two of oil every tank of gas.

-sent off to the junkyard due to parental decision in favor of me spending my own money on a $650 Motobecane mo-ped <where is Child Protective Services when you need them>

1981 to 83 off to college, shared 1980 Chevy Citation with mother when home, details to follow....

1983 to 85 - 1971 Plymouth Duster - Since I really_was _a car guy, I wanted one of my own in the worst way, and was scheming for how to approach this situation. Was all set to find myself something like a fixer-upper Fiat X 1/9 (oh to be young and naive-what was I thinking), but the older sister of someone I was working with had just bought something new, and was selling her college car, and offered it to me for the princely sum of $225. Faded blue metallic with primer showing through, 225 slant six, A904 Torqueflite, blue vinyl seats with a huge hole drivers side, and serious rot issues on the trunk floor and left rear quarter. Oh, and 124,000 miles, so the powertrain was just getting broken in, except for loud howl from the rear. Another $100 got some Jensen 6x9's for the parcel shelf and a cheapo 6 watt AM/FM cassette, and I was 4 wheels and steering wheel mobile. Manual drums and six turns lock to lock steering too. Minimal repairs in those 2 years. It really was an excellent beater. Sold it in 1985 to a dishwasher at the Bennigans I was working at, who while joyriding ran a stop sign a month later and got T-boned. End of Duster

1985 to 1988 - The '80 Citation mentioned above? I was commuting a fair distance daily while both working full-time and going to school, so the parental unit decided to ""sell"" me the now 5 year old Citation with 60k miles on it. This was a rather unique car. Iron duke, 4 speed manual, manual steering and brakes, no A/C either. Mother was rather cheap. This car had had its tranny rebuilt twice under warranty when new, and three months after the ""sale"" to me, it blew chunks again. The local tranny shop relieved me (actually, rather, loaded up my Visa card - in debt college students are nothing new) of around $1000 for a rebuilt, a clutch while it was all apart, as well as a pair of those quality sealed GM wheel bearings. After this cash injection the car actually ran rather happily, until the thermostat decided to stick open, and I made a feeble attempt to replace, which didn't go at all well as the pot-metal threads stripped out of the water outlet. Since it was winter, I took it to the corner gas station to get all offending parts replaced, where-upon the drunk son of the owner had his foot slip of the clutch and drive it through the bay and into a wall! $2000 damage with dents everywhere, and took 6 months to get the check. By that time I was used to it, so I just kept the money and drove it.

1987 to November 1988 - Graduated and bought my 1st new car. 1987 Plymouth Sundance. Actually a sort of fun, but Chrysler sometimes pops out good ones, sometimes bad ones. Guess what kind this one was?. 2.2 Turbo, 5 speed, met an untimely end on a rainy interstate in Pennsylvania, when I hit a huge puddle, hydroplaned, couldn't catch it, and backed hard into an embankment. Made it kind of banana shaped. Did manage to drive it home, but it was seriously totalled.

In between this time, I had sold the Citation to a friend's father who needed a local station car for commuting, and bought Mother's current ride, a 1985 Plymouth Horizon. Compared to the Citation, a much better deal, and really rather entertaining. 2.2, 5 speed, and with a shock/strut transplant and a huge front sway bar, a pretty good handler, and an excellent H Stock autocross car in its day. When the Sundance got whacked, I was down to this one car now. I had the itch to buy something, but held off until...

March 1989 to July 1995 - Yes, an eternity for a CCBA member, but this was an extremely useful vehicle. 1988 Ranger XLT regular cab long bed. 2.9 V6, 5 speed, stale leftover and bought off the showroom floor, for something like $2k off a $10.5 list, so it was cheap too. Drove it for 150k miles, did a ton of towing cars to race event all over the country.

Off and on September 1989 to July 1992 - 1986 Civic Si, partnership purchase with a friend for a shared autocross car. Bought cheap for $2k, with 190k miles. Replaced just about the whole car, but it was allowed, since this puppy had had a hard life. We traded ownership on and off to share insurance costs. Ended up giving my half to him when he went through nasty divorce and needed a daily driver.

In between here somewhere, I sold the 85 Horizon to a co-worker, since due to the parent having a major illness I was babysitting her 1988 Horizon, bought when I took the 85 off her hands. At one point for about 3 months I was juggling 4 cars.

September 1991 to June 1992 - 1987 Chevy Camaro IROC 350. What was I_thinking. I had alway thought these looked like fun to autocross, but after I bought one (low miler - for $9k), found out they don't turn, don't stop, melt posi's, and in general merit their lousy rep. Dumped it for $6800 after 9 months. I did own it though during the time of my 10 year HS reunion though :-) At mid 1992, back down to just one vehicle - this just can't be!

July 1992 to current - Has it been over 12 years? Another 1986 Civic Si. Bought to be a dual use sometime daily diver to supplant the truck as well as autocross. Fit that bill for two years until mileage, wear and tear and age, and me had no time to fix it. After being parked for 6 months, in 1995 got gutted, prepped and turned into Real Race Car.

October 1993 continuing my bad habit of assisting my mother buy cars, bought a new leftover '93 Civic CX for her. This was the base model, but at least by this year they had cloth seats and didn't look that cheap inside. This was her 1st car ever with A/C. I made the 48 payments, she's still driving it today, 11 years later.

During 1994, no car purchases, since I was broke paying a mortgage on a house bought the previous year, payment on the Civic, busy commuting 2 hours one way to a job I took 8 months after buying house, and meeting the woman of dreams (nightmares? (!))

January 1995 - With marriage, inherit community property of 1992 Saturn SC. What a POS. Wife still has fond memories of it. Can't figure out why. Good thing she bought an extended warranty; it was used frequently. Since I hated the car, and we had family plans in the future, it was traded for in:

March 1995 to March 2000 - 1995 VW Jetta GLX. Rip snortin' VR6, 5 speed, lots of power toys and comfort and convenience. <continued..>"
1525	October 27, 2004 3:57PM	racer63	"Thought I was going to be able to auto-x it too. NOT. It was apparent I would have ultimately roofed it, so after 2 months it was relegated to family car status and I built up the Civic. Reliability for a VW - not bad, almost no repairs years 0 through 4, year 5 OTOH, that 5yr/75k extended warranty came in handy for lock cylinders, every cruise part, multiple window regulators, coil packs, etc, totalling about $3K in 12 months. Traded in the day the warranty expired. Got more than 50% of what we paid new at 5 years old and 65k miles. Can't fault the resale, but never another VW. Dodged a bullet with this one.

July 1995 to December 1998 - 1995 Ranger XLT Subercab. Since I now had a not-street-legal autox car, after a few trips with the hi-mile '88 Ranger, the spouse/CFO and I decided that it didn't pay to freshen the old truck, so lets get someting new. Since the '88 had been great, I wanted another Ford, and tripped over this truck, which was exactly what I wanted. 2wd, 4.0, 5 speed, 3.55 limited slip, with the Splash sport suspension, but having the regular styleside bed. I still miss it. Drove it 80k in the time I had it, but, since we had grown to a family with 2 toddlers, it needed to go, so it got sold and:

December 1998 to hopefully not much longer - 1999 Explorer XLT. The ultimate compromise family truckster vehicle. Does lots of things, none particulary well. 5.0 V8, all wheel drive, power toys out the wazoo, but what a disappointment. Has taken the honor formerly bestowed on the '80 Citation for most money picked out of my pocket for repairs, even though I have hugely improved mechanical skills.

March 2000 to current - 2000 Toyota Celica GT. Traded the VW + $6900 and TTL for this. I actually really like this car as a daily driver and weekend play toy, but local dealer experiences, as well as some icky dealings with Toyota corporate over sour tranny syncros and bearings this car had from day one keep me from loving it, and will probably make avoid any Toyoters and Lexi in the future. Was bought with the intention of being a keeper, and after the electron gremlins of the VW, is a stripper with u-crank windows and locks. It is rather miled up at not even 5 years and 80k, so it will be around until the wheels fall off.

Now for something totally different had in-between.

January 2002 to July 2004 - 1995 29' Gulfstream Class C Motorhome, on a Ford E350 cutaway with 460. Since I still play with cars on weekends, and had wife kids and dog to drag around with me, besides always wanting one, I talked the spouse/CFO into us buying this used RV. I *thought* it would make my racing adventures easier. (^h^h^h) It was a private sale purchase for $22k. It did need a few obvious minor things for around $1k, ate a 110v house generator after 1 season ($1.6k), blew out an inside rear dual during year 2, ($600 for 4 new tires across the back), but that was it for repairs. It was fun, but hugely more work to both maintain and use than I anticipated. That, and it_was_ starting to get old, and I was having nightmares about what might break and cost thousands. It wasn't getting used very much either...only 8k miles in 2.5 years. Sold it in 2 months for $21,300, so the fix-its aside, a pretty cheap vehicle to own. Rid of MH, and still looking for that ""easy"" way to get things to events:

Last week of July 2004 to current - 2004 GMC 2500HD Crew Cab. 4WD, 6.0 gasser. Even with the smallest gas motor, this thing is a beast. Easy to decide on this one with 0 for 60 from GMAC. The goal is to sell the Exploder and have Mrs. Racer63 drive this monster to the grocery store, shopping mall and soccer practice. It doesn't feel any bigger than the SUV until its time to park. Effectively will replace both the MH and the Exploder, especially if we go through on the plan to sell the open car trailer and buy an enclosed hauler equipped with some comforts of home.

So the total since 1983, (Ok to forget about the Vega?): 17 in 21 years. Not Platinum, but certainly a medallion level of some sort. And, anything that has had money borrowed against it to buy has always stuck around long enough to get paid off, with the exception of the RV, which was a HELOC float, so I haven't been frittering away the milk money.

Already planning the next purchase, just don't kow when. Since as soon as the Explorer goes, the fleet will shrink from 4 to 3, none of them exactly close to a real car. 20' long, 6500lb truck, 2+2 Toyota, 1 seat race car. A nice semi-practical 4 door/wagon type vehicle is acalling. Something in the TSX/A4/E46/C-class range would be nice......"

racer: You definitely qualify for some level of CCB membership. Maybe harlequin will be along shortly to give you your official designation.

On a different note, my dear husband has found something that caught his eye ..

1997 Tacoma regular cab 2wd 4 cylinder 5-speed with 80,000 miles. He has been wanting a ""beater"" truck and this one seems to fit the bill. The Odyssey was supposed to be our ""truck"" but we ended up liking it too much to put hay and other yard stuff in the back. They want $3000 for it. It needs tires and looks like it has some paintwork on the front end but nothing major."

My, how the worm turns. Wife is not wanting to spend $500+ per month on a car payment for a new ride for her, so now we're back to the idea of getting a car for the daughter and the wife and I continue to drive the Saturn and the Focus. Of course, all bets are off the first time we get 8"" of snow here. Took a look online at the Scion xA - can get one for about $15K fully loaded.

We shall see."
1530	October 27, 2004 5:28PM	akangl	I'm going to head into town now and get different winter tires put on the car. I think that will solve the problem. See? Maybe I am cured, I'm not running out and buying a new car.........I'm actually not sitting bad in the Focus and most certainly could trade it. However, I've got bigger plans and that means I need to keep the car and just put GOOD winter tires on it.

Celica had OEM Bridgerock RE92's. Miserable tires. No traction at all in the dry, let alone snow. First fluffies with the car, barely got it off the street. Forget about getting up the 8% grade 100' long driveway. This was only with <2"" of snow.

Still had a set of K-car 14"" steelies from my old front-drive mopar days, conveniently same 5x100 bolt pattern. A quick fitment check that they fit over the front brakes and off I went to the Wholesale Club for some $48 each BFG Winter Slaloms. (what a name). Car will GO anywhere. Have only gotten stuck once, high centered in 2 feet of snow in the downtown alley behind work, and it's been a tough few recent winters."
1534	October 27, 2004 6:51PM	stickguy	"my new Scion tC has those tires. I'm not expecting too much in the way of snow traction. Thankfully I live close to work, and my wife is in the same building, so my plan A is stay off the snow, and use her van.

Hopefully we go back to the no snow in winter pattern (I'm in NJ) that we enjoyed until the last year or 2. Just get a couple of 6"" dumps for the kids to sled on (weekend preferred).

OT, do other CCBAers also love looking at tires? I always wander through the tire section when we are at BJs just to browse (plus I like the smell of new sneaks), even though I won't need tires for a long time. But, if I was to do more potential snow driving , I would go with winter tires."

This frugality carried through to my Mrs., who was only on car #3, the '92 Saturn, when we got hitched. She did 10 years (!) in an '82 Horizon TC3 in between the 80 Horizon and the Saturn. I think I have at least started to corrupt her some."

I paid $410 for the set of 4 Blizzaks and unloaded the studded snow tires at a used tire place for $60. Not too shabby considering I paid $100 for them and then put 4k miles on them.

The tire place cut me a deal, they said as of today I have spent $2001 in there in the past month, lol. Have bought 14 NEW winter tires from them and the 4 used ones from a private seller. OUCH OUCH OUCH

On another note, I slipped up and dropped by a car lot today. Looked at the Suzuki Aerio (or whatever it is) wagon AWD, sat in it, hated it, wouldn't drive it, looked at a used 2000 Legacy Outback Limited Sedan with 80k on it. Nice car, but not $13,9 nice, MAYBE $9,9 nice, didn't drive it either. Got back in my Focus and went merrily on my way, no interest in either car or any other for that matter.

I bought my first car when I was 19: (Aug 1995)

1982 Honda Accord 4 door. It had mould on the dashboard, a garden hose served as the fuel filler, as the fuel filler neck to the gas tank was rusted through, each tire and wheel was of different size and brand, muffler held by ropes, front windshield held by tar. When I jacked the car up to change a tire, the jack went through the floor board, front fenders wheel lip missing two inches due to rust.

Next was a 1986 Chevy Celebrity.
Oct 96 to Oct 2000: A new 1997 Honda Civic EX 4door.

Oct 2000: 1983 Honda Accord 4 door

March 2002: 1984 Honda Accord hatch

Sept 2002 on : 1993 Honda Civic Si coupe

Total 6 cars in 8 years. Not enough for me, and that's why since I don't have the money to get a new car every year, I got into car sales, so I can drive them all for free!!!!!!!!!!!

akangl: I am convinced that a Honda Element would be the perfect third car for you up there. I know you said it's ugly but it does have it's advantages for your area ..

1. AWD
2. HIgh road clearance
3. Better gas mileage than the Titan
4. More flexibility with cargo and passengers than the Focus has.
5. Interior is very spartan and can be wiped out. No carpet to get dirty.
6. That sky light would be a nice feature for when you go fishing/camping.

Again, I know you said it's ugly. Which is a valid argument (though I actually like the looks of the Element) but that would mean you wouldn't mind getting it dirty."
1555	October 29, 2004 8:49PM	kyfdx	In practical everyday terms, you are driving a two-door car. Every time someone needs to use the back seat, you have to open and close the door for them.. No problem if the only rear-seat passengers are babies.. But, I'm sure it would get old picking up the kids from school.. opening your door, so they can get out at the mall, etc, etc..
1556	October 29, 2004 8:53PM	anonymousposts	Yeah, but for most purposes the suicide doors wouldn't be that much of an issue. Besides, akangl current has a Focus hatchback. It has to be more convenient than getting out and flipping the seat forward everytime. And if there is no one in the front passenger seat, your backseat passengers can just exit through the front passenger door. And even if you have to unbuckle and open your door so the backseat passenger can get out, is it really THAT big of a deal? It should take about 45 seconds max.
1557	October 29, 2004 9:08PM	kyfdx	"You are right.. compared to a Focus hatchback, no problem.. But, compared to any normal four-door, it is a major pain..

Just wait until little Gee gets to be eight or nine...

I mean, you aren't going to have him come around to the driver's side of the car in traffic...

Plus they get away with not having to worry about roll-down rear windows and probably a few trim pieces here and there.

Considering the thing's supposed to be downmarket from the CR-V, I guess they had to do some things to it like that. If it was a 4-door, then there's really no reason to choose it over the CR-V, or vice versa."

Okay, since ya'll won't buy anything, we might.

We have found a 99 Honda CRV EX AWD. It's in great condition but has 120,000 miles. We can get it for $6300. Here are the scenarios that have crossed our minds,

1. Buy the CRV and re-sell it. Private party on Edmunds is $8900.

2. Trade the Lexus for the CRV. Should be an even swap and our insurance would go down. Additionally, we might actually drive the CRV therefore reducing our spider population.

3. Trade both the Si and the Lexus and pocket about $2500.

4. Let it pass even though we like it and it would make sense to buy it.

1570	November 1, 2004 4:09PM	anonymousposts	A quick look on autotrader.com shows that the average price for a CRV is $10,000. Admittedly with a lot less miles. But we have other vehicles so we would not rely on it as our only source of transportation. Arguably at 120,000 miles the CRV has at least another 30,000 miles of fairly reliable use left. After it hits 150,000 miles (probably in 2 years the way we would drive it) we should still be able to get $3000 for it at least. We all know anything that runs and looks nice now costs about $2500-$3500. So a loss of $3000 over 2 years isn't that bad for an AWD vehicle that we can use for many purposes. If we do get relocated north it would definitely come in handy.

For most non-premium Japanese cars with over 100K, you have to take the blue book values with a grain of salt. They are enamored of Japanese cars, especially Hondas, but the public will not usually pay these prices, since they can get a 2 or 3-year-old American car with 30K miles for the same money. And now the Koreans are coming into play in the used market too (from, say, model year 2000 on). I have heard that Black Book is a more accurate indicator of market value."

I'm not sure how Ebay will tell the market. Every customer I've had that uses Ebay as their barometer uses the ""But It Now"" price. Unfortunately, the current bid is usually $5,000 below the ""Buy It Now"" price w/ one day left. Check out how many cars have their ""reserve met"", That'll give you an idea."

Car was in ok shape, scuffed rear bumper, pretty nasty door ding on the driver's side, ex-rental, oh and the little bugger would NOT start. Finally got it started, then it died, started up again, died, started up again and revved it, stayed running that time. Might have just been cold I don't know. I didn't drive it.

Dealer is asking $14,990 for it. I told him I'd pass on that one but to call me if another one with less miles, not an ex-rental, and in better shape came in. I don't know, most days I'd love to have AWD, but Zippy is doing pretty good and is so darn reliable.

Second, any time you can acquire a clean Honda or Toyota for well below book, it's worth buying. The only thing I'd suggest is that, if you really intend to maybe keep it, is look for a RAV4 with the same cost/benefit ratio -- they're a lot more fun to drive, really. If you don't believe me, test drive them both at a dealer near you...."
1578	November 2, 2004 3:43AM	akangl	"Oh I don't know, I really like the car, just wish it was AWD. We'll see, I'm not making any snap decisions. Just a thought rolling around in my head.........really shouldn't do that, lol.

Neither of the trucks are in danger, we like both of them. Just wish we had bought an AWD car rather than Zippy."

The scenario you mentioned used to be our MO. We work for a large used car retailer so we can get trades at cost. Sometimes they hit cars very low. Like my Lexus was only $10K 2 years ago.

But we've gotten spoiled on these new cars lately. It really sucks when you get used to a new car every 6 months. I gotta get rid of my spider condo....But it's so nice."
1583	November 2, 2004 4:14PM	harlequin1971	"I got a bid on Zippy (the Focus), the Nissan dealer hit it at $8300 ACV (or hard money as he called it).

don't let us down...you want to keep your diamond member status don't you?

maybe a nice used Audi Quattro?

oh wait...that would drop you to merely Platinum...since it needs to be NEW new cars every 6 months...

Maybe you should find and test drive a new 9-2x, basically a real nice impreza with a better looking face (IMO) and extra sound deadening inside...could even have it serviced at any Subaru dealer...since the mechanicals are pretty much identical."
1584	November 2, 2004 6:16PM	racer63	Based on -0- calls to last week' ad in the local newspaper chain for the ex-family truckster '99 Exploder, I just got done putting an $8995 special in the big Daily Wipe. Starts Thursday for a week. Hope to be rid of this Turkey before 11/15. Terry in RWTV hit it at $8500 to $9 on a push, so I should get some action. Then maybe plan on what's next.(?)

On another note, my Titan seems to be developing even more problems lately. Talked to the GM of the dealership today, he wants me out of that truck. He said I shouldn't be paying for something that has so many problems. He's calling Nissan tomorrow to see what he can do.

Sucks cause I love my truck and am not too thrilled at the idea of giving it up. I was in tears, not sure what to do, the service manager things there's a good chance at a buyback. Even then I don't know if I'd give it up. Its got engine and 4WD problems now, plus a host of other things that have been wrong with it that there is no fix for currently.

I just wish they'd fix the darn thing and it would chill out for a while. I've traded vehicles for less, just seem overly attached to this one."

badtoy: Like Gee said we liked our RAV4 2 door but we don't like the styling of the RAV4 4 doors from 96-00. We love the sytling of the CR-V's and the current generation RAV4's though.

1596	November 4, 2004 12:00AM	akangl	"I don't know what's going to happen. I talked with Nissan consumer affairs today and they basically told me that because I haven't left my truck with the dealer for several days/weeks that I haven't afforded Nissan the opportunity to fix it. Um, ok. Then the guy went on to say that a tech cannot properly diagnose a vehicle in just 8 hours. Um, ok, whatever.

So, I think my next move is to drop the truck off at the dealer and leave it there, just tell them to call me when/if they fix it. Going to go talk to the GM tomorrow and see what he has to say.

Its not that I don't want my truck, I do, I love that truck. I just want it either A. Fixed or B. Replaced with one that doesn't break every other day."
1597	November 4, 2004 9:53PM	nippononly	"well, to be fair to Titan, it is a brand new model, where the Jetta and the ML have been around for years and years.

akangl: dealer service department sounds kind of weak. 8 hours is insufficient for diagnosis?? Is it the only one in town up there?"
1598	November 4, 2004 10:01PM	corvette	Yeah, is this the service department that ate in your Titan?
1599	November 4, 2004 10:06PM	kyfdx	You get hungry on an eight hour diagnosis....
1600	November 5, 2004 2:53AM	akangl	"Different service dept. Its not the service dept that says they can't diagnose it in 8 hours, that's NISSAN saying that. So it goes in on Monday and I will get a loaner, the GM said I can just take the 04 Explorer I traded in as the loaner since I need 4WD.

The dealership is behind me 100% so that's really nice to know. The GM said if I had come to him sooner (like within the first month) and told him what was going on he would have ordered me a new truck and swapped me out. Ah well, hindsight is 20/20.

I honestly DO NOT want a new truck, I just want mine fixed. I must love this truck, I've traded vehicles for less problems then this one has. Here I am at the 5 month mark and fiercely protecting it."
1601	November 5, 2004 3:11AM	ghulet	"...your Exploder is still there? Strange, wonder what they're asking for it!!

But seriously, why would you want to keep a five month old, problematic truck if they offer you a brand-new one? It may not come to that, but still."
1602	November 5, 2004 5:25AM	akangl	"I can't get the same truck I have now. The color has been discontinued and some of the options that are very important to me I can't get on the trim level I currently have.......although they were available on my truck. So, that makes me want to keep the one I have.

As for the Explorer, well, um, I paid $25k OTD for it BRAND NEW after rebates.........the Nissan dealer is asking $27,990. Explorers are a dime a dozen, there are tons to be found that are cheaper and nicer than that one."
1603	November 5, 2004 12:27PM	ghulet	"$28k for a used, fairly basic (IIRC) Explorer? No wonder it's growing whiskers. I know 4x4 vehicles are expensive and desired in AK, but still. That's downright scary.

Well, I hope Nissan takes care of you, one way or the other. I understand about the color and options, but if you could end up with a (maybe) fixed lemon as opposed to a no-miles new truck (color and options notwithstanding), it's still a no-brainer, IMO. Good luck either way!"
1604	November 5, 2004 1:49PM	corvette	At least the Exploder isn't in a garage as a spider home... Wasn't yours a 2-door? That makes the price even more outrageous!
1605	November 5, 2004 2:00PM	racer63	"Makes me glad I bought a GMC 2500HD in July. Looked at Titans hard, but decided several things weren't useful enough, like the 5' bed in CC's, the wimpy payload and rear axle rating, and rumor issues with fried rears and melted trannys when pulling any sort of a load.

Too bad, because they are pretty nice packages."
1606	November 5, 2004 2:42PM	driftracer	"I have to say, though, to accept keeping the truck, when the real option for Nissan is eating $5-6k to take yours back and you get a brand new one, with no money out of pocket (the way the law is supposed to work, anyway, they're not doing you any favors), why walk away from a $10-15k gift?

What if....check this out: You don't swap the truck, you keep it a while, you lose your engine, which is entirely possible given the scary noises, and you have another 3-4 weeks down and a reman engine?

The 4x4 issues come back, and you have more downtime, and more reman components?"
1607	November 5, 2004 3:00PM	anonymousposts	"Maybe the Titan isn't enough ""truck"" for what you use it for. Nissan is VERY new to the full-size truck game. Maybe if they buy it back you should look at a Ford F150/250. Not as fast as the Titan but they are pretty and probably more durable."
1608	November 5, 2004 3:12PM	akangl	"The Explorer is a 4-door XLS Sport (alloys and side steps), but still an outragous price.

As for the Titan, I will not give up on it just yet. I love that truck. I just want them to fix it. I know it seems like a no brainer to take a new truck or a buyback if they offer, but I just can't do it.

I know its silly, but this truck is everything I ever wanted. It does everything I ask, most of the problems are minor stupid things, but the engine/4WD problems definatly have me concerned. We'll see what Ed can do, he's a good guy and a great tech (Nissan Master Tech), I've known him for 7 years.

*IF* it comes down to a buyback.......and it very well could, I will probably give up the truck and walk away. I won't take another Titan, they are great trucks, but I am hesitant to go down this road again. Will just keep the Focus and keep plugging along. Thankfully we have another truck (although its worthless as a family vehicle).

This whole thing breaks my heart, but I think I knew from day one this truck was a lemon, it hasn't stopped breaking since the minute I drove it off the lot."
1609	November 5, 2004 3:55PM	hammen2	"Jolie, I feel your pain. I had the similar experience with GM and my GTO - didn't even own the car for two weeks and took it in for some minor complaints, and the car spent 20 days (!) in the shop (and then the dealer broke/misassembled a couple of things, scratched the paint, and the car came back with a suspension problem it didn't have when I took it in the first time).

They've now fixed virtually all of the issues, with the exception of not putting my passenger-side door lock assembly together correctly, after doing a TSB. This is the only thing I am taking the car back for (and I'm going to wait for it) and then I'm never setting foot in that dealer's service bay ever again (since I'm pretty convinced the dealership was 90% of the problem with my car).

Before the suspension problems were fixed, I wanted GM to replace the car, but they wouldn't, due to it not being 30 days out of service (it's only 27). Now that it's fixed, the car and I have ""bonded"" (since I've been able to drive it for two weeks pretty much without issues), I don't want to replace it (and it's a rare color, the Cosmos Purple Metallic, which won't be produced next year, so I know what you mean about wanting a particular color).

I have been working with GM Executive Relations and, from what I've heard from others, I fully expect them to offer to extend my bumper-to-bumper warranty for the hassles I've had (I've got only 2100 miles on the car - had 850 on it when I first took it in for service - and I'll probably be garaging it for the winter in a couple of weeks, *sigh*). Maybe Nissan will do the same for you, if they can fix the car. They'd rather do that than the $$$ the buyback will cost them. Of course, if you've already purchased a warranty extension, maybe you'll get the money back...

--Robert"
1610	November 5, 2004 5:44PM	anonymousposts	If they do buy the Titan back get something that has proven reliability. Get a Toyota Highlander, Subaru Forrester, or pre-owned RX300. Or get rid of the Focus and get a larger family sedan that still gets the same gas mileage ... Accord, Altima, Camry, or Mazda6.
1611	November 5, 2004 5:47PM	akangl	"Robert

That's about how I feel, I'm not in a hurry to give up the truck by any means. I like it, we've *bonded* and I'm happy with it. What I'm not happy with is its constant need to visit the techs at the Nissan dealer. I'm hoping after this next visit......they are going to keep it until its fixed, that it settles down and is a good truck.

If its fixed and seems ok I'm going to lean on Nissan for an extended warranty, haven't bought one yet, but know I need one. I've been very patient since I know its a first year model and I need to give them time to sort it out. Time will tell I guess."
1612	November 5, 2004 5:48PM	akangl	Problem is we need at least a 1/2 ton truck, so that would send me back looking at Ford, Chevy, Dodge, and Nissan yet again. I'm hoping to just keep the one I have, yeah its a booger, but its mine. However I won't turn down a buyback.
1613	November 5, 2004 5:50PM	anonymousposts	Well, never though I'd say this but the Ford and Chevy might be better bets than another Nissan. Give them a few more years to get experienced in full-size trucks.

Now, I've gotta find a car that fits the parameters:

1) cheap to insure (4-door american?)
2) $3000-$5000 price range

Scoured todays paper and found a few possibilities, all from Denver area dealers:

a) 2000 Buick Century ""low miles"" $4999
b) 1999 Buick Regal ""low miles, leather"" $4999
c) 1999 Chevy Cavalier ""super clean w/ low miles"" $4988
d) 1998 Ford Contour ""V6, auto, 30K"" $4950
e) 2000 Ford Focus ZX3 $4690
f) 2000 Saturn LS ""loaded, low miles"" $4688

Thoughts? Comments?"
1629	November 5, 2004 10:43PM	volvodan1	"a & b would be my choices. I would go w/ the Century 1st since it is one year newer than Regal, if it's relativly the same ""low"" miles for the year. The Buick twins would be the most reliable of the bunch, by far. I would also think they are the best for insurance. This is assuming they have been maintained, decent shape, etc. The others may be o.k., but the Buicks are probably the best overall choice."
1630	November 5, 2004 10:56PM	kyfdx	"I agree...but, I like the Regal.. 3.8 engine versus the 3.1 in the Century..

As Terry says, Be There.
Bring a flashlight, look around the baffle under the oil filler and check the valve train for sludge. Ditto the dipstick. Then check for body work... Prizms, like Corollas, have easy-to-see VIN stickers on all the body panels.

If all seems well, whip out $3000 cash and start dickering. Don't lose it. And forget the collision insurance -- that alone will make it worth buying the Prizm.

Now, as for my membership........well, I will give it up gladly if it means I can keep my Titan. I will do anything to keep that truck. Now the Focus........well, um, she's a different story, but has been saved from the ax because she is soooo very reliable. Ack, this means I'm not buying anything, its been 3 months since I bought the Focus and 5 months for the Titan. Guess its time to say goodbye to my CCB membership. :-(

Terry.......I know they are having a lot of trouble with the Titans. Get on Titantalk.com and go to the problems forum, its pages and pages and pages and pages.....well, you get the idea, of problems and complaints. Great trucks, but lots of quality control problems.

1635	November 6, 2004 4:30AM	anonymousposts	"I'd go for option a, b, or possibly f. The Prism would also be a good choice and probably the most fuel efficient/reliable.

I really wish we could get back to the old days of having only one ""nice"" car and a couple of ""decent"" cars to drive every day.

Here is the current plan ... Keep the Civic. Turn the Ody in at the end of the lease and then buy the Accord at the end of it's lease for $13,000. My reasoning behind buying the Accord is that a new Accord would be another $10,000 and a comparable new car for $13,000 would be no where near as nice as the Accord even with 40,000 miles on it. At that time we will owe about $2000 on the Si if we haven't paid it off before then. So that leaves us with the Si and Accord (I'm assuming/hoping/praying the Lexus will be gone by this point). Then we will buy a TL/TSX type car and be done for another 3-5 years. Maybe even lease a new RL.

akangl: I think you could get just as reliable of a car as the Focus but you will have to pay more money. The Matrix, Corolla, Altima, etc come to mind. 30MPG is OK in the Focus but you could equal that with a larger, nicer car."

1638	November 6, 2004 5:11AM	akangl	We bought a 2001 Corolla last summer, hated it, very unreliable. Looked at the 2003 Corolla and hated it. The Civics he doesn't like and the Sentra was even more basic than the Focus is. The Focus is a great little car, more reliable than the Corolla that we had last summer. Nothing wrong with a Focus at all, very tossable, corners like its on rails, neat little cars.

Also, should you wind up giving up the Titan, the F-150 should be a better truck overall, interms of Payload and towing, and its got looks.

If you don't wanna spend So much I think GM (even in your neck of the woods) will give you a bucket load of incentives if you buy the Silverado/Sierra...

Im guessing neither will have many problems, but hey we all understand your bonding with the truck...

So then they put it back together, and it seemed okay at first, but then the paper-thin plastic wheel well liner popped loose, hit the tire at highway speed, and shattered on impact.

Then, a few months ago, at the construction site, somehow he brushed against a pickup truck and put a nice big crease down both his doors and broke his mirror! Odd thing is, he drives work trucks all the time. He can handle a dumptruck or water truck with a tandem axle all the time, but put him in that Corolla, and I guess he doesn't know how to handle himself!"
1643	November 7, 2004 1:21AM	akangl	"On the Corolla, it was a 2001 (bought in 2003) with 40k on it. Had starter problems and leaked oil, could be from prev abuse, I don't know. All I know is I did not like the car at all and never trusted it to behave.

As for the Focus, it will be sticking around, seems to do just fine. I don't NEED an AWD car as much as I WANT one. The Focus is reliable and decent to drive, going to hang on to what we have.

Now the Titan, well, will know more next week. I'm hoping I get to keep it too, I enjoy driving the truck.

Now on the Toyota subject I've seen 3 broke down Toyotas this week and one Geo Tracker. Starting to wonder about the Yotas."
1644	November 7, 2004 2:59AM	corvette	That'd be the perfect job for you. Contract yourself out to do cold-weather testing for all the various car manufacturers...
1645	November 7, 2004 3:15AM	akangl	Does cold weather testing up here every winter. I thought about being a test driver for them, but they only pay $8/hr, I make more at Walmart.
1646	November 7, 2004 4:21AM	nippononly	LOL! So in other words, all of your uncle's problems with his Corolla have stemmed from his habit of hitting things with his car? :-)
1647	November 7, 2004 5:00AM	gee35coupe	Do they give you a car to drive and pay the insurance. That may be worth a few $ per hour too. Not to mention you get to drive whereever you want and not to work every day. Priceless.
1648	November 7, 2004 2:44PM	hammen2	"...you get to drive different cars all of the time - a real plus for CCB's (kinda like free drinks for an alcoholic - oh, wait, maybe that's not a good analogy :-)

1649	November 7, 2004 9:02PM	badtoy	bear in mind, my brother, that anecdotal evidence may be more poignant, but the sample is so small as to be insignificant. However, if you like your Focus and it gives you no trouble, there is no reason not to buy another. Besides, I've always liked the styling, and the handling is superb.
1650	November 7, 2004 10:20PM	andre1969	if Akangl's a brother, then she's sure fooled me all these years! ;-)

1653	November 8, 2004 9:12PM	michaellno	"Decided to not sell the VW ... yet. Son may go on strike this week (grocery stores here in CO), and may get a new job that requires a drive. So, we're putting that on hold for the time being.

Wife and I drove a Jeep Liberty Limited on Saturday. Much nicer than I would have thought. Wife likes the ride height, ground clearance and the looks of the interior as compared to the Saturn VUE; not so sure about mileage (17/22, though many seem to get less).

Plus side is that as a Chrysler supplier, we can get invoice - 1% - rebates.

Still would like to drive the Hyundai Tuscon, however, and see how it compares.

ak: sorry to hear about your Titan-ic (ouch!) truck problems. I know how much you like it and want to give it every chance to live up to your expectations. Gotta be tough to see it spend so much time in the shop, especially when the shop is so far away!

So, it's been how long since a CCB'er has actually pulled the trigger and bought something? Maybe someone will get a Christmas gift, like maybe a Lexus with a bow on it!"
1654	November 9, 2004 1:28AM	ghulet	I know they're not the same thing nor do they share the same engine, but I seriously doubt a Liberty is going to get 17/22, based on experience with a Wrangler (manual trans, too). The Liberty is still a big, heavy brick with 200hp.
1655	November 9, 2004 2:29AM	akangl	Dropped the Titan off today, I'm back in the Explorer (the one I traded). We'll see what happens from here I guess.
1656	November 9, 2004 2:41AM	nippononly	stick shift Camry SE for sale the other day - the current model, about two years old, even had a moonroof. Almost made an offer just for the sheer novelty of having the only stick shift Camry in the western hemisphere, LOL!

He told me of getting about 12 mpg around town, and ""maybe"" 18 on the highway. After several months of ownership and no improvement in mileage, I recall that he really regretted buying it."

1662	November 9, 2004 2:47PM	andre1969	"12 around town and ""maybe"" 18 on the highway sounds like a close description of my '67 Catalina! But then again, a Liberty, with the V-6 and 4wd, probably weighs more!

Shame that the Liberty's such a guzzler. I've driven a few, and kinda like 'em."
1663	November 9, 2004 4:32PM	stickguy	"Just do it dude. One of my favorites sayings is ""it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission"", or at least you get what you want out of the deal.

My wife is agitating for her new Odyssey before Christmas. Biggest problem is her deciding what color she wants, and then actually finding one on the ground or incoming, and of course getting a decent deal (hopefully less than 4+ hours away).

i think she may be waiting until after new years, but it might give us something to do over Christmas while we are in NY at the relatives."
1664	November 9, 2004 4:43PM	akangl	"I've played around with options on the Nissan site and found the exact truck I want. Have to buy a bunch of stupid options just to get the ONE that I want. MSRP comes to $37,910......still beats the heck out of having to buy an LE (MSRP $42k) to get that ONE option (Nissan decided to let the SE have the VDC too). Sooooo, I guess when I go pick mine up I'm going to see about ordering a new 2005 Nissan Titan SE CC 4x4.

My daughter is heartbroken, she is so very attached to *her* truck.

I threatened to just buy the Explorer back, the kids about pitched a fit, was good for a laugh I guess. Driving that Explorer makes me realize how much I miss it, but I wouldn't buy it back, I like having a pickup truck of my own, not an SUV."

you would, however, drop from Diamond to Gold and then eventually to silver...not likely to happen with the miles you drive.

Plus, you can still go out and test drive a bunch to earn the extra merits from CCB ""window shopping""

you still have three months to buy something new to keep your Diamond Status...not bad if you ask me.

question is for the rest of us...do we think akangl will drop to gold or keep her diamond for another 6 months?"
1666	November 9, 2004 5:58PM	akangl	"I know my Focus isn't going anywhere and the Titan won't be for another 2-3 months if at all. The Dodge is coming up on its one year with us here in a couple days.

Guess I'm going to start dropping down in the ranks, oh well, maybe I'm cured and don't need this forum anymore........yeah right. ;-)

As for window shopping, doesn't appeal to me much anymore. I'm pretty content with the vehicles we have, I just wish the Titan would stay out of the shop.......at $30 in gas per trip its starting to get expensive."
1667	November 9, 2004 6:00PM	kyfdx	I, for one.. am not worried about akangl's status.. I am positive that she will have another vehicle in the fold prior to Christmas.. I give it 50/50 by Thanksgiving...

The Explorer is here, but I don't think that counts. Have had several people ask me if that's the one we got rid of in June......yup, same truck. At the price they are asking for it its gonna have a birthday on their lot. I paid $25k OTD brand new for it, they are asking $29,999."

Oh, ye of little faith.. with akangl, all things are possible.. provided a favorable FICO report..."
1670	November 9, 2004 6:36PM	akangl	I say its not possible because we have other things taking priority. The Focus is doing fine, no reason to replace it, the Dodge is doing great and making us money, no reason to replace it. The only one in danger of being replaced is the Titan and even though they offered a 2004 Titan I refused, I want a 2005, so I will wait. Unless the 05 Titans come in early I won't be getting a new car before Christmas.
1671	November 9, 2004 9:05PM	klbrmb	"I'm new to this board although I probably should have landed here a long time ago (on my 5th auto and only been driving for approx. 10 yrs).

I felt I really needed to respond to this post. I am on my second (yes second) Libby(2003) and I drive alot of freeway and can average between 19 and 21 mpg. It didn't take long to get to this point and no I don't drive like a granny I average between 70 and 75 on the freeway and use the cruise. If I am driving a mix of city and freeway it usually falls to 17 to 18. I got the same mileage on my last Libby(2002) too."
1672	November 9, 2004 10:03PM	michaellno	"Thanks for the input on the MPG for the Liberty .. I'm the one who is considering it for the wife.

Her driving is partially rural (2 lane roads, 50-60 MPH), with a bit of in town driving. Seems we should expect 17 or 18 MPG.

If you don't mind my asking, are there a lot of hills where you are? See, we're in Colorado, so there is a lot of up and down where we live, which impacts mileage quite a bit. We were getting approx. 17MPG in our 2002 Explorer (4.0L V6) and 13-15MPG in our '99 Expedition (4.6L V8).

Gonna be hard to deal with mileage numbers in the teens again. Others we're considering are the Saturn VUE (19/25), Subaru Outback 2.5XT (19/24), Ford Freestyle (19/24) and the Hyundai Santa Fe (17/21)."

1679	November 11, 2004 5:47AM	18fan	My friend with the Liberty was in Western Pennsylvania at the time, where it is quite hilly. I'm pretty sure, though, that most (maybe 80-90%) of his driving was stop & go city/suburban driving and that he seldom took it out on the highway. The hills will definitely have a negative effect on gas mileage, as the vehicle (any vehicle) has to work harder to go up & down hills than to navigate a flatter terrain.
1680	November 11, 2004 1:13PM	driftracer	I autocrossed it (the PT GT) several times. We needed a truck, and had planned to trade for a truck for a long time. I'll be getting a toy to play with fairly soon.
1681	November 11, 2004 1:38PM	klbrmb	For the most part, land around us is flat however, we vacation in Southern Ohio and this is a different story. The mpgs there are not so nice. The roads are extreme there and are the constant up, down and around the mountain. If your roads are like this then you may want to consider an AWD car instead of a Jeep. I love my current Jeep and cried as I traded my prior three in. But, even I have to admit the Liberty would probably not be economical unless you have some need to tow something. Due to the amount of driving I do even we are looking at a new car (Volvo S40) and I know these come AWD at a fairly reasonable price.
1682	November 11, 2004 2:18PM	akangl	"****Didn't I see a 11/15 ""premonition"" a page or 2 back?****

Believe me, I had NO intention of doing this, but they offered MSRP to MSRP on a trade from my used truck to their new truck. So, basically its costing me an extra $2500 over what I owe on my truck right now to step up to a brand new truck with 45 miles on it vs the 15k I have on mine, a later build date truck, AND an LE (I have an SE).

We'll see, it could all fall apart tomorrow and we will bring Mr. Tidy home and wait for his parts to come in, then the tech can go back to chasing gremlins. Either way it works, I still have a Titan."

You CANNOT get CCB credit for trading in a manufacturer/dealer buyback situation for a defective vehicle. It doesn't count. You didn't go shopping and run out and trade for frivolous reasons, like you (and we all) have done in the past.

Sorry, but as CCB Chairman of the Special Rules Committee, we have a netrual zone infraction - a mamber is trying to claim CCB status maintenance when they didn't trade for goofy reasons.

Even though you are stepping up to an LE, are you getting all the options you wanted? I remember you saying something to that effect in an earlier post.

Looks like the VW will be going up for sale this weekend. Son cleaned out his stuff; all it needs now is a good cleaning and some ""For Sale"" signs.

Wife is making lots of noise about getting ""her"" new vehicle. The way she sees it, she is driving ""my"" car (the Saturn), while I am driving our daughter's car (the Focus). This, she claims, leaves her without a car that is ""hers"" (translation: one that she picked out specifically)."

I did tell him if he let me take that car for the day (instead of the Corolla demo loaner)he might sell it. I'm not sure he realized I might be serious! At least they had it wildly overpriced. I know I can negotiate, but if it was at a too good to pass up price, who knows what would happen.

Now, just have to figure out how to convince my wife she isn't getting a new Odyssey soon to replace her van. Maybe if I offer to let her drive the TL, and I'll keep the Quest for myself? Of course, after this many years, I think she would see through that scam...

Now if the Trep was in the condition of that 'Bu, with faded paint, a headliner held up with wood strips, a dash cracked in 3 places, a gearshift indicator eternally stuck somehwere left of ""Park"", a grille and header panel from a different-year car, a crease in the driver's door, and a crease in the rear quarter, and unable to pass emissions, then it would be a no-brainer!

1710	November 12, 2004 5:04PM	andre1969	"since 1/1/00, my fleet really hasn't changed much. But here goes...

10/01: Bought my '79 NYer 5th Ave that I found on eBay.
9/02 (IIRC): ditched my grandma's '85 LeSabre Limited. It needed about $600-700 worth of work already. My Mom had an '85 Silverado, that had been my Granddad's, that she wanted to get rid of, as she just got a new F-150. So I was already thinking about cutting something from the herd. The LeSabre gave me that excuse when, one day, I hopped in to head off to work, and as I put my foot on the brake to shift into gear, it went right to the floor.
10/02: took delivery of Granddad's old '85 Silverado.

So it's been over 2 years now, since I've tampered with the fleet. I guess I'm slipping!

I did come close though, early in the year, to buying a 1980 Chrysler Cordoba LS that someone in my Mopar club was selling. I always loved the '80-83 Cordoba/Mirada, and this one seemed tempting, at first. It had a 318 out of a '75 Dart, but had the Lean Burn stripped off and a Mopar Performance distributor. a 4-bbl carb also found its way onto that engine. And the rear-end came out of a '68-70 Charger. It was either a 3.23:1 or 3.55:1, can't remember now. And the tranny either came out of the Charger or Dart, I can't remember now. So basically it was an '80's body, but had with none of the downfalls of an '80's drivetrain. In fact, it sounded pretty darn nice when it fired up. Unfortunately, it was very rusty, and the brakes had gone out (rear brake line)

It was one of those cars that, if I got the brakes fixed, would've been fun for a little while, but would've ended up either costing a boatload of money to fix up nice, or would have probably fallen apart within a few years."

That, and it comes fully loaded (leather, sunroof, etc.). The only option, I think, is the nav system. The folks at C/D loved it in their December edition.

The only downside is that it's $30K. For an Accord! I think its something like $3300 more expensive than the EX-V6. Quite a premium.

====================
Did I say it must be reliable and cheap to own to? Besides having an itty bitty bit of resale at 5yrs and 150k?

I thought of the Mazda, but I've known many people owning them over the years, and their opinions always start with...""Well, its not a Honda...""

The Altima IMHO is just too fuddy duddy and rental car like. Might as well drive an Impala.

3 series Beemer. Would love to have one, however cost to own just plain excessive. E46 clutches are an annual wear item. I hate it when I have to do brake pad in less than 40k. I know someone who autocrosses an '01 330ci thats done 3 clutches in a year? Yikes!

A new Legacy GT is intriguing, however this is the same 5 speed that self destructs behind the WRX motor, and now we have what is just a de-rated sTI 2.5 in front of it. I'll pass......"

As boring as I think it is, I'd take it over an Impala any day. The SE-R might be more entertaining, but at that price point I would expect a nicer interior and stability control.

I'd reconsider the Mazda6. Especially the MazdaSpeed version that should be arriving shortly. Might want to stick with the 6i/6s if you're planning to mile it up.

The Accord Hybrid does not have a sunroof. It was omitted to save weight. It's a shame, I really like a sunroof. The performance numbers are nice, but I think I'd just buy an EX-L four-cylinder and keep the money. That with a five-speed would be more entertaining than the hybrid with an automatic."

I noticed in the Consumer Reports survey, they moved the CTS into the ""recommended"" category as a result of quality improvements, and counted the F-150 as one of the least reliable cars. That news shocked me on both counts. Less shocking: VW scored five spots in the least reliable categories. With performance like that it makes you wonder if VW is trying for the bottom spot."

1735	November 13, 2004 8:26PM	corvette	"Good. Makes me feel more cozy about calling my Altima ""indestructible."""
1736	November 13, 2004 9:27PM	andre1969	"because I knew too many people, first-hand, who had problems with them. Back in the late 80's, a friend of mine didn't actually have a car of his own, but his family had a bunch of cars, and he'd just drive whichever one was available. Usually it was a '72 Dart or an '83 Stanza. Well, that Stanza was junk by the fall of '88, when they drove it, wheezing and smoking, to the Ford dealership and traded on a brand-new '89 Escort LX 2-door hatchback. They got $1800 in trade on it, but I think the dealer just did that to make them feel good, as they paid about $9,000 for that Escort!

I also knew a few people who had later-gen Stanzas, the Maxima-based one. Seems like those things liked to break timing chains, which would kill the engine because it was an interference design. The 3.0 Nissan used in the Maxima seemed prone to doing that, as well back then.

My Mom & stepdad had a '91 Stanza, and its tranny started to crap around the 90000 mile mark. In early 1998 they decided to start getting rid of some of their cars, so they offered to either give me their '86 Monte, which had about 179,000 miles on it, or sell me the Stanza. Well, the Stanza was getting to the point that it needed a tuneup, exhaust work, and tranny work, while the Monte felt like it was good for another 100,000 miles or so, so I took the Monte!

Now that Stanza was able to nurse that tranny to around 110-120,000 miles, when they sold it. So I don't know exactly what was wrong with it. Anyway, personally I thought that Stanza was crap, but they liked it enough to buy a '99 Altima, one of those funky ""origami"" styled ones.

It's tranny took a dump at 35,000 miles. That didn't leave me with a good feeling for Nissan quality. However, Nissan did replace it under warranty, and I don't think the car gave them any more fits until around the 80-90,000 mile mark, when it left them stranded. Twice. Turns out it was just the battery, something I don't fully understand. I can see a battery failing to start a car, but I've actually pulled the battery out of my Dart while it was running, and as long as the positive cable didn't touch anything, it would run just fine. But I guess newer cars can't do that!

But anyway, they still have that '99 Altima, and it now has over 150,000 miles on it, so in the long run, it's proving to be a good car for them.

The last negative Nissan experience I've had was early in the year. A friend of mine has a 2001.5 Passat, that was giving him no end of trouble, and he had an '03 Sentra as a loaner. Now that thing was a wretched little car IMO, but it was also a rental, so I guess you can't blame it all on the car! He also had an '03 Intrepid SE for a few weeks, and one day we compared it to my '00 base model and played a little game of ""Find The Cost Cutting"". Sadly, it wasn't a very hard game to play!

I really like the current-gen Altima, though. And since the '05 restyle, I like it even better. I took an '02 out for a test drive back around March of '02, and really liked it. Honestly, if I weren't so upside-down on my Intrepid at the time, I think I might've actually bought it! It was a 2.5 model, and I think it was the S. It had air conditioning...is that what differentiates the S from the most basic model? It was also a really nice shade of green, that I really liked. Kind of a cross between olive green and a silvery-green. They also had a similar green at the time, that had a bit of a bluish hue to it.

I could've gotten that sucker for invoice at the time, but I was also about $4800 upside down on the Intrepid. They would've been more than happy to roll that into the new loan for me, but I wasn't ready to pay $480 a month for an Altima!"
1737	November 14, 2004 12:12AM	corvette	"The S includes cruise control, floor mats, air conditioning, power mirrors, keyless entry, and some other stuff I'm forgetting that isn't included on the base model. It also makes available options like alloy wheels and side airbags. In 2005 the base model is only available with a manual transmission.

It's interesting that a loaded SE-R tops $30k, and the base starts at $17ish. I guess that's kind of like a Tahoe vs. Escalade/H2 or a work truck Silverado vs. the Denali model, it's just odd that most of the guts are the same between two cars with huge price spreads."

Is this normal for a 3 year old car with 50,000 miles? These filler/caulk/weld(?) areas expand and contract if I press on the window frame.

It a boring, safe unspectacular choice, but a 4cyl./5 speed Accord EX-L would probably be the best bang and bling for the buck. However, this hypothetical discussion may all be moot, since I got a bite locally Friday for an even better high-falutin' position, that would not require the 55 mile one-way commute that got this started.

FWIW, the Accord is getting 34-35 MPG highway and the Si is getting 32 MPG. We took the van the first trip but I had more important things on my mind than measuring MPG. I still have more important things on my mind but the trip can get boring after a few times.

1744	November 14, 2004 7:34PM	wildrice	"Hello Everyone,

I think I am becoming obsessive about buying a new car. The car magazines, alluring car ads, and the Internet (obsessive car research), make it oh so easy to obsess about new cars. Although I can afford to pay cash for a new car (which makes it that much harder to resist buying), I know that I really do not NEED a new car and that buying a new car is a very poor way to manage one's finances. What I really do not like is that I sometimes have a hard time getting the idea of buying a new car out of my head. I would much prefer to think about more constructive or creative things. Sometimes the options, colors, comparisons, rating, reviews, specs, and pricing run around in my head out of control.

Deep down I know that buying a new car will only bring momentary happiness and possibly deep disappointment if the new car does not live up to expectations.

I also feel somewhat victimized by the ad media who want us to obsess about buying big ticket items that we do not need.

I own a '97 Honda Civic EX which runs perfectly, gets great gas mileage, looks good, and suits my frugal nature. I ride bicycles, a motorcycle, and a motor scooter, so my yearly car mileage is low (5,000 miles a year). My yearly bicycle mileage is 4,000 to 5,000 miles a year). I am currently obsessed with selling the Civic at a loss (or giving it to a relative) and buying a Suzuki Aerio SX for about $15,000.

Logically I know I should just be happy with what I have and not desire a new car. I will try by removing cars from my PC wall paper, stop buying car magazines, stop searching the newspaper car ads, stop going to dealerships, and stop doing Internet car research. Part of my plan is to vent my feelings here.

Help me break my addiction to new cars!"
1745	November 14, 2004 8:08PM	andre1969	"if there's just something about this time of the year, that cars start getting into my blood, and the urge for something just gets overpowering.

Lessee, looking back, I bought my '69 Dart GT in late September, of '89. Bought my '57 DeSoto in late September of '90. And this might be reaching a bit, but I brought my '79 Newport home on New Year's Eve, 1996, although I had bought it about 2 or 3 weeks earlier.

Bought my '00 Intrepid on November 6, 1999. Bought my '79 New Yorker in October of '01. And my Mom gave me her '85 Silverado in late Sept/early Oct of '02.

So, it seems like this time of the year, broadly speaking, is when I'm most likely to buy something. Probably just a coincidence, but I actually went so far as to email the local Toyota dealer about a car they have in stock...a '94 Buick Roadhazzard!"
1746	November 14, 2004 9:37PM	millspd	I almost bought a Roadmaster 3-4 years ago. The mileage was too high (can't remember how much right now) but it was in beautiful condition. Ended up buying a Grand Marquis that had some HVAC troubles. Probably shoulda bought the Buick!

1749	November 14, 2004 11:10PM	corvette	"Terry,

I bought it used... The Carsmack equivalent that eBay uses came up clean. The best, best case here is that this is just a kooky thing that Altimas do. I doubt it, but I will look at another early-build Altima to be sure. Also seeing a speck of surface rust from the Hannibal Lecter body repair. I will be getting the repair redone somewhere else, but it may be time to throw in the towel on this car. For the record, we have:
   - Hail damage/repair (before I got it).
   - Holes in cloth seats and torn seam repaired (crappy job on the torn seam, all done before I got it).
   - The crack thing on the driver's door.
   - Rear bumper and impact absorber replaced, repainted two more times to correct.
   - Entire right side repainted twice (once to correct the first), body filler used on the right rear door, but not in the area where the surface rust is appearing.

Come to think of it, when I got it, the alignment was off, the tires were worn funny, and one wheel was bent. Possibly caused by a prior accident? I'll ask the new body shop when it goes in to give it a once-over for previous repairs. Thanks for your help!

Here's a pic of the rust I posted in the rust topic:"
1750	November 14, 2004 11:58PM	andre1969	"yeah, they're not the most beautiful car in the world, but I still kinda like 'em. About a month ago, I saw a '96 for sale at the Carlisle PA swap meet that was just about perfect for me. They wanted $4995 for it. It had about 85,000 miles on it, but showed really well. It was kind of a dark grayish green that's similar to the new ""Magnesium"" color that Chrysler now puts on 300's and Magnums. Interior was leather, and kind of a generic beige/putty color.

This Toyota dealer also wants $4995 for their '94 Roadmaster, according to the Pennysaver ad. I don't know how many miles it has on it though. I went to their website though, and they have it listed for about $5500. No pic, but the description just says ""Gold"".

I dunno if I'm ready for a gold car just yet. Can a white belt be far behind? ;-) Seriously though, I think these cars look good in blue, that greenish-gray, and burgundy!"
1751	November 15, 2004 12:49AM	corvette	I prefered the Impala SS, but saw them on the local roads all the time when I was thinking about getting one, so I nixed it.
1752	November 15, 2004 1:45AM	andre1969	"an Impala SS, but back when they were new I couldn't afford one, and they've held their value well enough that I don't want to pay the going price for a used one!

Back in late 1999 I did almost buy a '96 Caprice with the 350 though. Basically it was the same mechanically as an Impala SS, but with more sedate Caprice clothing. It had just over 36000 miles on it, and they wanted $13,860 for it. I liked it, but they wouldn't budge on the price, and I just wasn't comfortable paying that much for something that was out of warranty. Sure, they offered me an extended warranty. I think it was something like $1495, and covered it for a whole year. Whoopee.

It also reeked of cigarette smoke. They told me that if I bought it, and then brought it back to them, that they'd put an ionizer to it and get rid of the smell. Considering they didn't bother to do that BEFORE putting the car on the lot for people to see, I just took that as car dealer-ese for ""that smell ain't coming out""!

Considering that they didn't make that many Roadmasters, I do still see an awful lot of them, at least around these parts. It's hard to put my finger on why, exactly, I like them, but I just do!"
1753	November 15, 2004 3:38AM	wildrice	"I agree that the time of year may have something to do with my new car obsession. Since the bicycling season is winding down, I have fewer outdoor activities to keep me busy. Instead of going to the bike shop to obsess over new bikes or pedals, I am stuck at home to read car magazines and watch TV. It is not so easy avoiding car ads, by the way. Car ads are in nearly every section of the newspaper and fill any guy-type magazine. Not to mention saturation car ads on TV. I used to read a free outdoor magazine until it got taken over by SUV ads. Apparently hikers, mountain bikers, and kayakers are favorite targets of SUV makers.

I often get the feeling that society is programming me to buy new cars. Being obsessed with cars is the ""norm"" and is encouraged. I have taken steps. I gathered up all of my car magazines and brochures and put them in a less convenient place. I changed my Windows wall paper from car photos to bike photos. I put the car web sites in one favorites folder and tucked it away in sub folders.

Part of the problem is that I own a '97 Civic EX. At 40,000 miles it is just barely broken in and will no doubt last 200,000 miles. Since I drive it 5,000 miles a year, I could end up driving it 40 years. The problem with Hondas is that you get tired of them long before they conk out on you. Not to mention seeing thousands of identical ones on the road. That's why the tuner craze is a good thing. Tuners cherish their present cars instead of wanting to buy a new car. Tuners make their cars more individual. Tuners wring out the best performance from what they have instead of just checking the bigger engine option when buying a new car.

My Civic EX is lightly modified, which has convinced me to hold onto the car longer. I also agree with someone's suggestion of keeping the car cleaned, washed, and waxed. I have less of an urge to buy a new car when the old one looks good."
1754	November 15, 2004 10:08AM	anonymousposts	wildrice: I think trading your Civic EX for an Aerio would be a step down. The 96-00 Civic is one of the best small cars ever built. They look and feel like a more expensive car. Besides, with a new Civic right around the corner you might want to wait and see if you prefer the 06 Civic to both your current Civic and the Aerio.
1755	November 15, 2004 2:01PM	andre1969	"at 40,000 miles, as long as you're taking care of it, that Civic should last you a long, long time. Now the Aerio actually is a neat little car, and I think they're pretty powerful. And you can pick them up pretty cheap. However, their resale is going to drop like a rock, and they're probably going to be harder to find parts for since they were made in low volume. I don't think they're even selling them new in the US anymore, are they?

And definitely, go out and give that car a good wash, wax, interior cleaning, etc. You'll feel a lot better about keeping it when you're done."
1756	November 15, 2004 5:14PM	andre1969	but I just got an email back from the internet manager at the Toyota dealer that had the '94 Roadmaster. Unfortunately it sold. I guess somebody wanted to be a pimp more than I did! :-(

OK, I'm still waiting for GM to decide about my lemon GTO (the dealership's ""on hold"" trying to fix it ""while the car is being discussed at multiple levels"" if that means anything).

Not really any chance that I would buy one (don't think it would serve the wifes automotive needs), but they sent me a test drive coupon, and hey, don't have to ask me twice to take a free $50.

They actually sent it to my 13 YO son. Must be becasue of his subscription to Sports Illustrated."

EDIT: coming home from the mountains on Tuesday, the wife spots an Audi allroad on the highway ... ""I like the looks of that Audi"", she says, ""How much do they run?""

When I told her they start north of $40K, she shuddered. Out of our price range --- by a lot."

1770	November 19, 2004 12:46AM	asafonov	"(chronic car non-buyer.)

I occasionally read the 90 or so pages of this thread with a mix of disbelief and admiration. Some of you guys/gals are truly amazing (you know who you are!)

But me, I am chronically not buying cars. Buying only where and when I absolutely have to. Buying used if possible and reasonable. I'd rather not mention how many and what kind of vehicles I have bought in 12 or so year I have been driving, to avoid ridicule (ok... maybe how many: 4 used, 1 new between me and my wife.)

Of course, reading this thread really helps one to catch the bug. The only way I know not to succumb to it is to stay away from car lots (TM), not ask to drive friends and coworkers cars - and stay away from the Townhall!"

Different layout (FWD vs. RWD with AWD available on both), but the Infiniti is ""nicer."" Then again there's not a huge amount of distance between the Pilot and those three.

I haven't heard anything on the new M35, but the TL and 2006 GS both look appealing. The RL is nice but I'm not sure if it's tuned to be a sporty driver, which I assume you want given the other cars in the list."
1773	November 19, 2004 9:21AM	ghulet	What would be the rationale for trading in an '04 Pilot for an '05?
1774	November 19, 2004 2:23PM	wildrice	"Hubbert's Peak is the prediction that the World's oil production will peak in the near future. As long as oil production can match oil demand, we will have cheap oil. But this will not always be the case. Very soon, we will be past the peak and in the era of ever diminishing supply. Also, countries such as China, now require large oil imports. The TV show ""West Wing"" touched on the subject, but did a poor job of stressing the urgency or the global economic implications.

It will result in out of control inflation as the costs of mechanized agriculture, manufacturing, transport, and plastics (petrochemicals) goes up and up. Not to mention wars over the diminishing reserves. Whole parts of the USA will be affected, as home heating oil becomes unaffordable. Pollution will become severe as we are forced to burn more coal.

Therefore, it makes little sense to buy into the automotive industry when cars will become obsolete. Hybrids are not the complete answer either as it still takes massive amounts of energy to produce a car, whether hybrid or conventional.

My solution is bicycles and scooters. I commute by bicycle 3/4 of the year and ride a scooter (60-70 mpg) the rest of the year. Each day I ride my bicycle instead of drive a car, I save one gallon of gas. It adds up. Imagine burning one gallon of gas in an open field. That is a lot of heat, smoke, stink, and waste."
1775	November 19, 2004 2:49PM	wildrice	"I think we desire new cars in the mistaken belief that owning a new car will bring us happiness. I think we all know that the new car ""honeymoon"" period is very brief either due to buyer's regret, mechanical problems, ownership costs, or boredom. I think it's part of human nature to want what we don't have and to be dissatisfied with what we don't have.

If one buys a shiny new car, how long will it be until we get tired of it and want to move on to the next new thing. The automotive industry plays on this, spending more money luring us with more power and sexier designs, instead of more fuel efficiency or practicality.

Also, cars create economic woes: steep depreciation, gasoline costs, insurance, repairs, up keep. There are many, many hidden costs.

I think we want to buy new cars for sometimes illogical reasons of convenience. I am amazed at how many people drive to the local bicycle park
with their bikes loaded into their huge SUV's. I seem to be one of the few who rides his bike there. For awhile, I even considered buying an SUV to carry my bike on out of state trips. Fortunately I realized that a bike rack on the trunk of my Honda Civic worked out just fine (35 mpg on the highway).

I think people can be happy without a car. I was very happy in college when I was carless and poor. Now college kids consider a car to be their birth right. I live near a private University. It's amazing what the rich college students drive: Lexus SUV's, BMW's, sports cars, etc.

I know it would be hard to become carless again, but I am trying to be car light. I try to put more miles on my bicycle than my car."
1776	November 19, 2004 3:40PM	jlawrence01	"A week ago, you are obsessed with buying a car. Now, only a week later, Youa re lecturing us on why we should drop our cars and move to the bicycle.

Your posts are being to sound more like leftist lectures."
1777	November 19, 2004 5:22PM	wildrice	"Yes, I admit to having new car buying addiction. This is despite being a bicycle advocate. I had to first admit that I had a problem. The worst thing was having my thoughts preoccupied with researching new cars. I took steps to alleviate the addiction. I had to limit my exposure to car magazines, brochures, and show rooms. Avoiding car ads is more difficult. For example, the Nissan Xterra campaign targets bike riders and outdoors people, like myself.

It is healthier to obsess about your children, health, diet, or exercise than it is to obsess about new cars.

I realized on my 30 mile bike ride today that one of the reasons we like new cars is the basic instinct to return to the womb. Think about it: the temperature controlled environment, heated seats, placenta-like seat cushions, fetal driving position, sound insulation, latte in the cup holder, and enclosed cabin.

The car stereo pumping out familar tunes is just the desire to hear the maternal heart beat.

It is time for us to grow up and break free of our infantile desires!"

Ghulet- A couple reasons I would go with the 05. more power, six disc changer (I hate that my current pilot doesn't have this), Upgraded nav, sunroof and VSA. All these were not available on the pilot when I bought it last year. All are available on the Pathy and new pilot. Also my current Pilot was in a wreck and while it was repaired very well kinda leery of long term reliability or god forbid subsequent crash worthiness."

If you have had a 1997 Civic since 1997, you are doing better than most of the people out there. The average car buyer trades every 28 months. Given that you drive about 5,000 miles per year, I don't think it would make a huge difference whether you drove a 35 mpg Civic or an 18 mpg Xterra. The national average is about 10-15,000 miles.

I didn't want to get rid of my first Titan, but the constant trips to the dealer got old fast and when they offered the deal on the new on I would have been stupid to turn it down. So far the new one is flawless.

We've had the Focus for 4 months and the Dodge for over a year, so we can keep something for a while if we want."
1784	November 20, 2004 1:28PM	andre1969	"for a CCB? I have a co-worker, whose father was an executive for Chrysler. One of the perks was that they gave him a brand-new car to drive every few months, and sometimes he'd get an all-new model before it was even released! My co-worker has told me several times, about when he was a little kid, his Dad brought home a new '66 Charger, before they were available to the public. He got to ride in it from DC to Virginia Beach, or something like that, and says that car caused quite a stir.

Well, once he retired, he didn't get those new cars to drive every few months, but his wife was used to always having a fairl new car. When my co-worker started working here in late '97/early '98, his mother had a '94 Intrepid base model. Well, one weekend his mother was going away to some golf tournament, and bought a new '99 Intrepid just for the occasion! She didn't want all her friends to see her in that old car! Kinda makes me think of an ""I Love Lucy"" episode where Lucy wanted to buy some new clothes, because all of her friends had seen her in her old ones. ""So get yourself some new friends"", Ricky replied!

Well, she really didn't like that '99, having to adjust from a low hp, but torquey 3.3 to a higher hp 2.7 that you had to rev to get power from. So with maybe 13,000 miles on it, she traded it for a new '02 or so Chrysler. I forget whether it was a 300M or a Concorde Limited, as I never saw it. But since then, that thing has given way to an '05 300C.

Actually, when I space that out, maybe it's not so bad. It only comes out to 4 cars in 10 years. But the thing that gets me is the mileage of them! The '94 only had about 37,000 miles on it, and the '99 only had around 13K. And I know the '02 or so couldn't have had more than 10-15K.

Those buying habits did rub off, somewhat, on my co-worker. Back in '98 he drove a Dodge Ram pickup. I forget the year, but it was only a few years old at the time. Well, one nice day in April I drove my convertible to work, and we went out to lunch with the top down. He'd never had a convertible before, and became infatuated right away. That was a Friday. Following Monday, he pulls up in a '97 Sebring Limited convertible! He got the impulse and traded his truck over the weekend.

However spring turned into summer, then autumn, and once the first frost hit, the magic of that convertible was lost. So were two transmissions by that time, I think! So it was replaced by a new '99 Grand Cherokee. Now that one, they actually kept for awhile. From late 1998 all the way through April or so of 2003. And it had over 100,000 miles on it by then. They traded it on an '03 Ram with the 4.7. And now that's gone, and they have a 300C as well, to go with his mother's!"
1785	November 20, 2004 4:16PM	mark156	"Jolie, I would have taken the new vehicle too if I had to go to the service dept so much. The only thing is, is that you leased the vehicle. Since you and your husband drive so much, how will you stay within the limits of your lease?

But, maybe it's not a bad thing, just trade the Focus out every six months to keep the ""runner"" fresh and new and not mile up that new shiny Titan. By the way, I think the white is a nice color!

1964 Ford Galaxie 500 2-door hardtop, 390-4bbl
1963 Chevy Impala SS 409 hardtop. It was the more powerful 409...I want to say 425 hp?
1965 Impala SS hardtop coupe. Can't remember if it was a 396 or 427? It was over 400 hp, though
1962 Chevy Corvette (the first car I can remember, although I think I was like 3 or 4 when he got rid of it)
1964 Pontiac GTO 2-door sedan. Motor was shot, and I think my Granddad helped him put a Chevy 400 in it. This was back when nobody cared about matching #'s or anything like that!
1971 Ford Torino 4-door. When my Great Granddad died, Dad got this car. I think it had a 302-2bbl
1966 Pontiac Executive hardtop sedan. I never saw this car, because this was after the divorce, and he had moved to Florida, and I didn't see him for about 8 or 9 years. He lost his license for DWI in 1984, I think, and that was when he got rid of this car. My grandparents had seen it a couple times though, and they said it was really pretty.
2003 Buick Regal. Dad moved back up here in the late 80's, and got his act together and got his license back in the early 90's. But he was still relying mainly on public transportation, and saving up his money. He finally decided he wanted a car, and I went shopping with him one day. When we saw the Regal, while it's not the type of car to get me excited, for the price you couldn't beat it. And now a little over a year later, Dad's still happy with it. He said that if he had just bought this type of car back when he was a teen instead of that high-performance stuff, it probably would have kept him out of a whole lot of trouble!"

1799	November 21, 2004 11:32PM	mark156	"I knew that I would barely qualify for the CCBA.... but, I think you meant to say that I had only 1 car every two years on average of 30 years.

I'm getting the itch though. I read about cars constantly. I get two car magazines, Automobile and Car & Driver. I also get Motorhome Magazine (I get a lot flack on this one).

I've toyed with the idea of getting a larger SUV then realize that my ML is the perfect size. I also think about getting a wagon, maybe the Mercedes E320 4matic. But, I like an SUV. I've paid $2.79 a gallon for premium in California and it makes me think do I want to continue $50 fill-ups when getting 14-16 mpg. The hybrids have really caught my attention so we'll see what comes down the pike.

Can't wait for the Los Angeles auto show, I go every year.

1800	November 22, 2004 12:34AM	ghulet	"Hmmm, I don't know if I can name them all, the earlier ones, in both cases, were likely 'family' cars, owned by grandparents and/or shared with siblings (in my mom's case, anyway--she's the oldest of eight!). Anywho,

Dad's cars, notice nothing remotely pricey, definitely not CCB eligible:

61? Corvair station wagon
64? Corvair convertible (grandpa was a Corvair fanatic)
64 VW Beetle w/sunroof (had in high school then sold to my aunt and uncle in 1970 or '71)
71 Datsun 510 coupe 4-speed, orange
72 Chevy C10 pickup 6 w/three-on-the-tree
74 Honda Civic (post-divorce, so bought in '78)
78 Datsun B210, briefly, won in contest then sold
81 VW Scirocco 'S'
89? Ford Ranger
76 Corolla (stepmom's) replete with vinyl floors
89 Mercury Tracer
91 Ford Escort
00 Hyundai Accent

Mom's, also not qualified for CCB (though from '84 to '87, she was in the running):

52 Chevy coupe, learned to drive on (1965)
63 Pontiac Tempest (she said it was fast, so maybe a 326?)
6? Ford Van, had when I was born in '69
Datsun and Chevy truck shared with dad
72 Ford Econoline w/stepdad, who had a '69 Impala he bought for $50!
78 Pontiac Sunbird (stepdad's first new car)
80 Fiat Brava (eeek, what a mistake)
84 Toyota Camry LE
86 Toyota Cressida
87 Porsche 944 stick, bought new, still has it
88 Mercedes 300E, bought in '92 w/20k, now @ 350k

Nothin' too exciting. I really liked that Cressida, though, mom bought it when I was 16. I was a bit of a terror in that one (115 in the rain on the tollway, what was I thinking?)."
1801	November 22, 2004 3:14AM	jlawrence01	"Your list brings up memories (g).

I was getting out of college in 1982 and looking for a car - any car - so I pulled out the local paper to find a car. Saw a 1x3"" ad for a NEW '82 Fiat Brava. I thought that would be great. A new car for under $5k!

I showed the ad to my kid brother who was in his second year as a dealership mechanic. Cleaned up, he said ""NO WAY! You are NOT buying that.""
Found out that it was about $7500 with auto transmission.

Ended up in an '80 Chevette. May not have been the greatest car but imagine finding a mechanic in rural VA for a FIAT???

The Chevette with all of its shortcomings was a vehicle that nearly any mechanic could fix."
1802	November 22, 2004 10:59AM	ghulet	"Are you sure that ad wasn't for the Strada? The Strada was a small hatchback, pretty inexpensive. Unfortunately, the Brava in '80 cost about $8k, which was fairly pricey--my parents could have bought a mid-pack domestic (a well-equipped Cutlass Supreme, perhaps?). The Brava was an alternative to the even more expensive Audi 4000 they really wanted. I don't know if that would have been any better at the time, really.

I agree with you about Chevettes. For all the knocking they've received over the years, I never thought they were all THAT bad. Yes, they were slow, had fairly scary brakes and the damn steering wheel always felt off-center or misaligned or something (just bent, like it was tilted sideways?). But still, not a bad A-to-B car, and at least mechanically simple. It filled the needs of many Americans when there weren't many good alternatives."
1803	November 22, 2004 1:40PM	corvette	">>>I'm going for the tattoo club.........got another one today. hehehe<<<

No comment..."
1804	November 22, 2004 2:51PM	jlawrence01	"You are right ... I guess I will charge that off to old age (g)...

On the Chevette, once you got the car properly aligned, the steering wheel would be properly alignd for a few thousand miles.

What I liked about the vehicle was that ANY mechanic could work on it (except the moron in Detroit), the parts were common and there were relatively few things to go wrong on it. If the door moulding every stayed on to the car.

And you NEVER had to worry about a speeding ticket."
1805	November 22, 2004 4:08PM	michaellno	"I don't think I can break down the folks car by mom and dad, but here's what I remember, plus what I was told. I have tried to put them in chronological order for the most part.

'57 Chevy convertible. White and yellow two tone, don't know about interior color. Dad totalled it on the higway after running into a cement truck.

'60 VW Bug. Blue, I think. Bought after the Chevy was totalled. What more needs to be said?

'53 Ford pickup. Black, rusty, 3 on the tree.

'67 VW Squareback. I think the Bug was traded in for this. Bought partially, I suspect, because my sister was born. Beige inside and out, 4 speed manual. Took us from CA to NY and back on a family vacation in the summer of '71. For some odd reason, I still remember the license plate for this -- the old CA yellow on black plates ""VVG 784"".

'70 Chevy 1/2 ton pickup. Orange with white roof. 350 2-bbl, 3 speed automatic. Bought new for $3500 (I think). The Ford was traded in for this - or dad sold it privately; not sure. Mom told him it had to last 15 years. 34 years later, it still runs strong. Currently in the shop having major cosmetic restorative work done on it (rust spots attended to, new paint, new spray in bedliner, replacing trim pieces, etc. Has had the top end of the engine rebuilt once, about 10-12 years ago. Averages 3-6K a year.

'73 Toyota Corona. Brown, 3 speed auto. Bought new for $2900 on 8/12/73 (Dad's birthday). The Squareback was on its last legs and needed a major engine overhaul, so the folks bought the Toyota. I do remember them looking at the Mazda RX-4 sedan as well. Mom's car - I learned to drive in this. Totalled when a lady pulled out in front of me one morning on my way to school.

'72 MB 220D. Burnt Orange, tan ""MB Tex"" interior, 3-speed auto. Slowest non-VW vehicle known to man. Folks had the car two months before needing a complete engine rebuild. Ouch. Got them vanity plates for it -- ""REAL SLO"". Mom hated the car with a passion - the ritual of waiting for the glow plugs to light, the fiddling with the choke, the lack of acceleration, the smoke - ugh!

'84 Toyota Celica GT hatchback. Light blue exterior and interior; 4-speed auto. Bought used from Toyota dealer; the MB was traded in. At this point, both my sister and I were driving, so the folks felt they didn't need a family sedan anymore. Fairly reliable, except for when the timing belt broke on my mom when she was 30 miles from home.

'91 Toyota Camry. Again, light blue inside and out, 4-speed auto. bought used from BMW dealer (Dad knows the principal owner). I had my son at this point and getting a baby seat into the back seat of the Celica was becoming an issue. That, plus the low seat height was a problem for the folks as well.

2003 Hyundai Sonata GLS V6. Burgundy with tan cloth interior, automatic. Bought new for invoice less rebates in March or April of '03. Camry sold privately. First new car since the Corona. Dad researched heavily before buying .. Mom was leaning towards another Camry, but when they found that the Sonata, with the V6 was cheaper than the Camry with the 4-cyl, they pulled the trigger. I also suspect that they were swayed by the warranty. I have not seen this car yet, but the folks love it. I think it may have something like 7-8K on it by now.

I keep trying to get my dad to sell the Chevy and get a new pickup, but he refuses. Has turned down offers of over $7500 for it. He's instantly recognizable anywhere in town because of that truck. He added some sort of custom exhaust system to it many years ago and could hear him halfway down the block when he was coming home."

He said he'd actually need a VIN # to be positive, but that most likely a 300C would only raise my insurance by $120 a year.

1810	November 23, 2004 11:21PM	michaellno	"So, andre's looking at $10/month more for insurance, and kyfdx is looking at $6/month more.

Question is, how much more for the payment?

Andre, wouldn't you like at least one month of no car payments? I try to envision that day, even though it would mean turning in my (provisional) CCB membership.

Lessee, the Saturn has 36 payments left, the Focus 39 and the VW 13."
1811	November 24, 2004 2:01AM	akangl	"****To me, why would you want something so permanent. Would you want green shag carpet for 50 years?****

Tattoos yes, Shag carpet, no. Both of mine are tasteful and can be easily covered up by clothing, it wasn't a decision I took lightly. I put more thought into a tattoo then I do when I buy a car.......scary eh?d

On another note, there was yet another message on my answering machine from the Nissan dealer today. I was thinking, ok, here we go, NOW they want the truck back. Nope, just want hubby to re-sign the contract AGAIN (third time) because they goofed up the payment......its lower than the contract states, lol."
1812	November 24, 2004 12:39PM	andre1969	"I'm really looking forward to having no car payments for awhile. It's just that, at the same time, the 300C is tempting. However, once you factor in my Intrepid as a trade, I'm sure I'd still be looking at at least $30,000 for a nice one.

One thought that keeps going through my mind though...if I took that $30,000 and invested it, how many years earlier would it allow me to retire? I'm only 34 right now, and can't even collect my full social security benefit until I'm 67. At a rate of 10%, $30K becomes $523K after 30 years. But then, by that time, houses around these parts will be 3 million for a shack, gas will be 20 bucks a gallon, a new Chrysler 300Z (that's what they'll be up to by then!) will be a half-million, and Grand Theft Auto: Barstow, for the Playstation 69, will be about 200 bucks!"
1813	November 24, 2004 1:09PM	mark156	"Andre, by the time you retire in 33 years, your home will be paid for and all of those cars sitting around will have become expensive, collectible antiques! So, you'll be on easy street!

I took care of my great aunt and thank goodness she saved over the years (lived to almost 101). The nursing home was $3,500 a month four years ago (private), now the same place is $4,500 a month. Social Security and a pension will never cover the needed expenses when we are old.

So, for every million you have saved, you'll get about $5,000 - $6,000 a month in income before taxes (roughly). Considering your example of future costs, it won't go very far!

Traded in the VW -- son got a 2001 Saturn L200 and the wife got a 2004 Saturn VUE AWD V6.

Many, many hours at the dealer but we got what we wanted. Came down to the Santa Fe or the VUE but the wife liked the buying experience at the Saturn dealer the last time (for my L300) - that was the deciding factor.

Good thing we got the VUE, as we have had 6"" or more of snow since Saturday morning.

So, I'm out of the car buying market for many, many years now.

Hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving weekend."

We've been talking about the car situation in our house and we may end up giving my Saturn (the L300) to our daughter and I would keep the Focus. Wife commented last night that I might be able to trade the Focus in for something else that I like ... can you say Mazda 3?

Right now he wants to recover from this and fortunately he sticks to his diet and meds. Therefore he does pretty well on dialysis.

He was driving down a main avenue and made a left hand turn in front a Nissan SUV. His car was hit at the passenger back door area continuing all of the way down the side. The back wheel was crushed breaking the suspension on that side as the car was sitting on the ground when I saw it. Also, both airbags deployed.

Other than that, who wouldn't be happy with 205HP in a car that size! Plus, the quad doors make it pretty useful for a coupe.

Son's girlfriend was drooling over the ION RedLine, too.

Funny thing is, when we called the dealer about leftover '04 VUEs, they had an Electric Green VUE RedLine available. Wife took one look at it and said ""no way"" -- nothing to break up all of the body color, so too much green for her liking."

Anyway, I was wondering, did you tell us that you have block heaters in all of your cars?

Bryan, I'm sorry that you have to have ""THAT TALK"" with your Dad about his driving. I'm not ready to talk to my Dad about hanging up the keys. Hopefully, he will realize that himself. The part I hate about him totaling out the LeSabre, is that he bought if for my Mom a couple of years before she died and she loved that car. So, it was a reminder of her and now it's gone too.

1854	December 3, 2004 4:21AM	akangl	"****Anyway, I was wondering, did you tell us that you have block heaters in all of your cars?****

Yup, all 3 of them have block heaters, the Titan and the Ram have battery heaters and oil pan heaters. The Ram also has a transmission pan heater (those darn cranky Dodge trannies insist on it).

The Focus we haven't finished winterizing yet, only has a block heater. Hubby has to winterize my mom's Subaru on Saturday, it doesn't even have a block heater yet.

Oh and *gasp* I drove the Titan tonight, first time in a week. Didn't want to ask Zippy to go back down the driveway, we have about 4-6 inches of fresh snow and Zippy hates deep snow.

Poor little car has packed rear brakes again, so we are back to the hanging up pass side rear brake. Have to put the car into reverse and get after it to force it loose."

However, I did get to witness two grandparents make the progression from driver to eternal passenger. Back in 1998, my grandmother's eyesight started to go...macular degeneration. The warning signs were slight at first...she didn't want to drive at night, or when the sun was setting, but then it just got to the point she didn't want to drive at all. When her 75th birthday came around in Feb of '99, she couldn't pass the eye test.

I think she got a bit depressed at first about it (who wouldn't?), but her son lives with her, and she has a cousin across the street, and a friend about 2 miles away, so she's not totally home bound. And last year, I moved in across the street, as well.

My Granddad, on my Dad's side of the family, just turned 90. He was still capable of driving, and the last time I had seen him drive (had him follow me to the service station to drop his car off), he seemed a bit extra cautious (which is a good thing), but that was about it. Still, it was getting to the point that he hardly drove anymore. His '94 Taurus, bought new, only had about 35,000 miles on it. He was getting to the point that he didn't trust himself anymore. Plus, his insurance was around $1200 a year, and he just thought it was a needless expense. With him, I don't think it was really a big deal."

Boy do I know that feeling. I actually showed a couple of non-carnut people the Edmunds website and after about 30 seconds their eyes started glazing over and they got an empty look in their eyes. Of course, they just traded up from a 87 Legend they owned for 4 years to a 2000 EX V6 Accord and their other car is a 93 Jeep Cherokee so they are far from car enthusiasts.

Personally, I think Gee ought to buy me .. I mean himself .. a late model 325-328 5-speed. They are relatively inexpensive, RWD, pretty to look at, and we've never had a BMW before. It would be different than our usual Hon-yotas."

1877	December 6, 2004 10:49PM	wildrice	"There have been some recent items in the news pertaining to car buying. In fact, they are good arguments NOT to buy a new car.

One article said that 2004 had a record number of car recalls. The excuse is the increasing complexity of cars. But it is a worrisome trend. Car makers are obviously in a rush to get new models and fancy gizmos to market without adequate research or testing. We, the consumers, are doing the testing.

The second article was about how Arab oil experts are coming to Texas to find out how to extract the harder to obtain reserves in older oil fields. USA oil production peaked in the early 70's and the former oil gushers had to be pumped and later infused with water. Our geologists had to develope new means of extracting the remaining oil in the fields. Apparently, some of the Arab nations are interested in these techniques. This is a strong signal that mideast oil production will soon be in steady decline (look up Hubbert's Peak). This will spell the end of the petroleum age and the automotive age as we know it.

A third article predicts the real estate bubble to burst. In some areas of the country, houses are way over valued. Also the demographic demand for new houses will be in decline as baby boomers down size and there are fewer new families. Car buying is already a losing proposition due to depreciation. Soon, owning a house could be a losing proposition too.

A fourth article states that the dollar is in steady decline compared to the Euro, Pound, and Yen. The White house likes this, as it favors US exports. But it will also make import cars more expensive. According to Greenspan, if other nations suddenly lose interest in buying devaluing US dollars (which could come with a crash), we could be headed into major economic problems."
1878	December 6, 2004 11:01PM	driftracer	"""a record number of car recalls""

It's not because cars are more complex, or they have more problems, or they fail in droves, it's because the vehicle manufacturers want to cover their corporate butts by doing preventive maintenance against possible law suits, especially class actions.

If a recall is performed, in the court's eyes, the manufacturer is released from liability in a major way, or at least their liability had been drastically reduced."
1879	December 6, 2004 11:12PM	nippononly	"the articles that trumpeted the news of a record number of vehicles recalled this year also quoted several independent agencies as well as the carmakers themselves saying that this was mainly because of much-increased vigilance, not the increasing complexity of cars.

Having said that, there is an editorial at automotivenews.com today that talks about how car bodies and engines are basically built indestructible these days, and the vast majority of automaker reliability concerns in the new millennium stem from onboard electronics. Not sure if I totally agree with the premise about iron-clad engines (GM piston slap problems) or car bodies (rusting Mazdas), but it does appear that electronics are by far the biggest problem area for carmakers these days..."

I've been car shopping for my Dad because of the totaled out Buick. After looking at a few Impala's, he decided he wants leather and power seats. I know I can get that on an Impala but he wants another Buick. So, I went car shopping at my local Buick dealer as no one else was out on a rainy day. As I drive up there are three salesmans salivating at the mouth. The salesman that ""got me"" was actually very nice and very informative about the new LeSabre's. What turned me off a little bit was as I drive up near the entrance door, he flips his cigarette out the door right before walk in. I find that so rude as it's obvious I can see him. Smoking is so gross to me (not to offend anyone, but it is a total waste of money and health).

But, I like the salesman, he is really a nice guy and not pushy and very informative. He goes out of his way to find the car that my Dad might be interested in, which he has 3.

I gave the info to my Dad and he wants to wait until the insurance check comes in to make his final decision. I roll my eyes as if it makes a difference at all what the amount of the check is.

Three-on-the-tree transmission was slipping a few years back, so he put one in from a junkyard, but the ""new"" one doesn't like to go into second. Turning on the wipers requires pliers, because the knob is gone. He got one of his migrant workers to ""repaint"" it black (the original color) a few years ago using some leftover black fence paint.

It was a total bucket by the time they got rid of it, and I think he drives a late 90's Ram now.

I'm also getting another mental picture of a mustard yellow and white truck that someone in my family owned too, from that generation. However, in this case I might be thinking of the '73 that my Granddad had when I was a kid.

GM made some cool trucks back then, but they sure didn't paint very many of them in attractive colors!"

I think the understanding is that they're required to ""make you whole"" again. That is, put you roughly in the position, financially, that you were before the accident.

They are deducting the rebates ?

Funny, Since its a supplier deal and not a employee/retiree/family deal the GM card points should be allowed.
You should call GM card direct........

I do know that regular GM card points are not eligible for employee/retiree/family. We have to have the GM familyfirst card and only get 1% instead of the 3%.

But you are getting a killer deal tho.
I would wait 2 months tho since you have to pay the last 2 payment. The rebates could get BETTER or GMAC may forgive them!

1915	December 11, 2004 7:38AM	nippononly	"just for some Friday night fun, I visited a couple of dealers tonight. Thinking of maybe just possibly replacing my 4Runner with something much more modern next year, wanted to see what my options were and wanted to try a range of vehicles.

 

On the truck-lite side, wanted to drive one of the new Outbacks. Guess what? 100 automatics in stock, not one manual. So I skipped the drive, but it is rated 23/28 for mileage and PZEV for emissions, acceptable I guess. The guy says he gets manuals all the time and will call me. Lots of standard features for a good price. Good space in the back with the seats down, and good space if you have to sit in the back seat. No separate pop-up glass in the hatchback though. Still has those Subaru frameless windows that I was never that fond of with my last Subie.

 

Then I was off to check out the new Tacoma in person. V-6 4X4s can be had in stick shift (6 speed no less), and are even on dealer lots, a pleasant surprise. The mileage rating is atrocious: 16/20. That is no better than my 15-year-old truck's real world mileage (gets 17 most of the time, 20 on highway trips). The power is good, but this may be more than I need; these days I mainly use it for camping and skiing, and the days of major offroading are decreasing. The extended cab now has rear-opening half doors for the jump seats in back, and the design is such that they rattle incessantly. The clutch is so light you can't tell where it is engaging at all, and the engine is so smog-strangled that the engine revs take about a year to fall between each gear, meaning until you get used to it you lurch into every gear.

 

Last stop was the intermediate between those two: Jeep Liberty. Drove it and loved it. Great vehicle, price is good (several thousand cheaper than the Tacoma), TINY turning radius, separate pop-open hatch glass (can you tell I like that?!), back seat is tight but that might be OK. Then came the downers: got back to the dealership only to be informed by the sales manager (the salesman was clueless) that 6-speed manuals, while supposedly available, are not being delivered at all by Jeep, and while he could take an order from me, he could not guarantee a delivery date nor would there be one I could test drive to be sure I liked the manual. They tried to tell me what i really wanted was the automatic. Such an annoying trait in salespeople, and the automatic is nothing special in the slightest. So that is on hold, they too have my number. Then I get home to discover on the evening news that more than half a million Dakotas and Durangos are being recalled for defective ball joints, and that more than a dozen have had wheels fall right off, and this gives me grave doubts that I would want a product from the related Jeep company right now anyway...not to mention that if I had decided on the Tacoma, I was aiming to test it again back to back with the Dakota, which is substantially cheaper, but I don't think I will do that now.

 

Between the two I preferred the Liberty anyway, still reserving judgment on the Outback though. Why oh why is it that manufacturers make such a big deal out of having a standard manual for a model, then they don't actually BUILD any? That Jeep sales manager said that in three years of selling the Liberty, he had seen no more than a half dozen stick shifts. Of course, that was at the point when he was trying to tell me that what I really wanted was an automatic, so maybe he was making it up.

 

Back to the drawing boards...gotta keep my membership current! :-P"
1916	December 11, 2004 1:50PM	robr2	Because the vast majority do want automatics. We're a dying breed.

I had better luck than you did. There were a handful of Subaru manuals at the small dealer I visited in central Kentucky. I don't think many station wagons offer the flip-up rear glass.

 

I'd say that, with the introduction of the diesel Liberty, they will start to see more manuals. The diesel contingent tends to like them in higher doseages than the normal population."

Been through the salesman deal too of ""wouldn't you really want an automatic"", and even the ""wouldn't you really want another kind of car""? When I bought the Celica, dealer closest to home kept trying to put me in a Solara (yuk! - with that name, all I could think of was Dodge Polara).

Well we are back to the drawing board as well. Someone rearended our Accord on Tuesday so keeping that car isn't a real possibility any more. We will get it fixed and then turn it in at the end of the lease.

 

Our latest ramblings have left us with turning both the Ody and Accord in, keeping the SI (or trading it for one of the new GTI's that are coming out next year), and buying another small car such as a 99-00 Civic, maybe a new Civic, or a new Jetta when they come out.

1926	December 13, 2004 6:10AM	nippononly	isn't the A3 longer, with a longer wheelbase? And if so, I will bet handling suffers at least a little.

1927	December 13, 2004 2:05PM	stickguy	"Yes, I believe it is a bit longer, but I doubt hadnling will be much better (it isn't that much longer).

 

Yep, big difference between 25ish with a normal moonroof (everything else important seems to be standard), and 31ish for the glass roof, V6, etc.

 

The 4 cyl FWD sounds like a nice package if you can live without Quattro and want a stick."

1931	December 13, 2004 5:44PM	nippononly	"the 6-cyl AND the AWD will not be available until later, right?

 

Even with all the major revisions to the new GTI, I think $25K might end up being a price that is a bit too high...all of the compact VWs are going to be overpriced for the market starting next year, I think. The Jetta and Golf should definitely have sub-$20K trim levels, and from what I have read, they won't."
1932	December 13, 2004 6:10PM	stickguy	"that's what I heard, but the reviews I read made it sound like the V6 was a waste of money, based on how good the new turbo 4 is.

Shouldn't have to, unless they weren't an authorized driver (it was stolen), or the other party's adjuster starts playing games with the estimates (more likely). My own experience with my own insurer (State Farm) is that you have to kick, scream, and put the screws to them in order to get what you want. I'm afraid to switch because I know there are worse--SF doesn't raise rates for not-at-fault claims (no matter how frequent), I've heard that others do."

We had looked at two new 2004 Buick LeSabre's on Sunday and the prices were just too high for a year end deal. We bought the Mercury for $6,100 less than the Buick after all taxes and fees; both were similarly equipped.

 

I found the seating much more comfortable in the Mercury. My Dad has never owned a Ford product, so, this will be a new experience for him. Big V-8 power and rear wheel drive is my favorite combo.

1935	December 14, 2004 2:20PM	driftracer	being a former cop, I've always been partial to the Crown Vic and Grand Marquis...
1936	December 14, 2004 2:30PM	andre1969	"one of my friends bought an '04 Crown Vic LX from CarMax. It had about 9000 miles on it. He's been pretty happy with it so far. Before that he had a '95 Grand Marquis GS, but it was really getting up in miles, pushing around 175-180K, and starting to have problems.

 

I actually kinda like the LeSabre, though. I think that, considering how small it is, it passes for a full-sized car better than most of the smaller FWD ones can. But in the end, given the choice I think I'd prefer the V-8 and RWD of the Crown Vic/Grand Marquis, too, over the LeSabre.

 

And even though these cars have been in production for WAY too long, they really have made great strides in them. I've driven my friend's '95 GM and his '04 CV, and there's a world of difference between the two. Much better acceleration, handling, etc. My only complaint is that the dashboard juts out, kind of like the old ""dog-leg"" A-pillar on old GM and Ford cars with wraparound winshields. I've banged my knee getting into these cars plenty of times. But then yesterday, I whacked my knee getting into my '79 NYer, so maybe I'm just clumsy! ;-)"

VW had a gorgeous color on the Jetta from 2001-04, Alaska Green. It was a blue-green-grey metallic. They canned it. Charcoal grey is really popular now, but I don't really see the appeal."
1940	December 15, 2004 3:35AM	steine13	"...to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have sinned. Or rather, I'm trying to work it out so I can.

 

Been surfing the Pontiac site. I've got an '04 Vibe, I like it, I need another one the way I need mumps.

 

BUT: GM has increased my $493 GM Card cash to $2k even and told me to buy something nice. The only car in the stable that I like is, well, another Vibe... and it's got $1,500 in rebates. Big deal, right? But hear me out.

 

GM Smart Buy is structured like a lease, and they will quote residuals on-line... they are astoundingly high. 05 base Vibe, 5sp, pwr pack, monotone: $18,865 sticker, 24 month, 12k pe year; the residual is an astounding $12k, or 0.62.

 

I can buy the car for $14, and probably a little less. Ka-ching: Monthly payment, pre-tax, interest ignored, of $2,000/24 = $84.

 

This, like I said, is ""SmartBuy"", a lease ought to be similar. Where's the magic? Well, the residual is about $2,400 too high -- I should know, I've got the identical car at 1 year old w/ 10k miles on the clock, and Terry said it was worth $11 a couple months back.

 

What's killing me here is the interest (7% -> $70+ a month) and the tax: 6% makes it $15/month, because the rebates are taxed.

 

So the real cost, to me, to lease the darned thing would be $165/month, add $30 for the collision insurance vs. the beater I'm driving now for a spare car, and I'm looking hard at $200/month. So I don't think I'll do it, but it's a great example to show that driving a new car -- even a pretty nice new car -- does not have to be expensive.

 

And since we're at CCBA, this oversized rant is fully on topic. Yay!

Our '69 Olds Vista Cruiser was ""Meadow Green""; our 1951 Plymouth was also green. I barely remember the Plymouth because I was a small tot in 1962 when we got our new 1962 blue Dodge Dart wagon.

 

A good friend of mine's Mom bought a white Grand Marquis a few days ago. He kind of got me thinking of looking at the Grand Marquis when I told him that I was going to show my Dad Buicks. Dad has had Buicks for quite a few years and he thought he wanted another until we found the wonderful value in the Grand Marquis. The LeSabre Custom doesn't have a fully electric drivers seat. The seat back moves by pressing a lever on the side of the seat whereas the Mercury has a fully electric seat with the controls located on the drivers door.

 

We saved $6,100 buying the Mercury compared to an equally equipped Buick on their ""year end"" prices. As I mentioned before, the seats in the Mercury were much more comfortable.

1950	December 15, 2004 8:07PM	mark156	"Andre, ever since I was a kid, I really liked the Lincoln Town Cars.... my uncle had a '74.

 

The perfect Town Car would be a 1977-79, triple white with the Burgundy dash, carpet and steering wheel. I have looked on ebay occasionally but have not found the exact color/low miles, etc that I want.

 

In those days, I thought that was pure luxury.

 

A friend of mine who was a surgeon, retired early, and after buying a few new cars wanted a 1961 red Corvette. When the car first came out, it WAS the car to have in his mind. He bought one that was red and white with red leather. He sold it last year because the engine caught fire due to the carburetor. After spending $5,000 on it, he didn't trust the car anymore so he sold it at auction.

 

I think everyone has ""their"" time when cars were special (for me, it's the late 50's- 60's- early 70's). Anything after '76 for GM or '79 for Ford, I have no real interest.

1951	December 15, 2004 8:25PM	andre1969	"why I like 70's cars so much, because that's when I was a kid. And I was too young to really realize how badly performance was cut on them. Well, that, and the fact that my Granddad knew how to override emissions controls! ;-)

 

A couple years ago at Carlisle, there was a gent selling two Lincoln Continental sedans. I know I'm going to get the details mixed up here, but I think one was a '77 with a 460 and a leather interior, and it was kind of a copperish color. The other was a '78 or '79 with a 400, velour interior, and a nice light creme/beige color. He only wanted $1500 for the pair, and both of them ran! The '77 actually wasn't bad, but the '78 had been hit on the side and was kinda messed up. And the velour just had a look to it, like a wet dog.

 

I had thought about buying them, but that's just too much car! And I actually preferred the '78, because I liked the color better, and I liked the '78-79 dashboard better than the '77 and earlier. And if it had been in better condition, I think that cloth would have been beautiful!

 

I've actually seen a few Mark IVs in white, with a burgundy dash, carpet, and steering wheel, but I don't think I've seen Mark V's like that, or the Town Car/Continental sedans or coupes. It really looks stunning on those Mark IV's, though.

 

IMO, the color to have on the later models is that light blue. Either the Diamond Jubilee blue or the other one. I forget which, but my buddy with the Mark V could tell you all about it, plus more than most sane people would want to know about the cars! They also had a pale green that I really liked.

 

As far as my ""time"" with cars goes, I think I pretty much lost interest in older cars with the exodus to FWD that was made back in the early 80's. And even though I like the style of a lot of the RWD cars, too many of them were just stuck with wuss motors and tall gearing."

Also, in the past when I found the ""almost"" perfect Town Car, it might be white on the exterior but usually it will have Burgundy velour interior which I do not want.

 

I have found a few '75-76 Cadillac Fleetwoods that I like but still would like the triple white with white leather and Burgundy accents. One day, the perfect car will come along and I will pay good money if it's like I want. Less than 50,000 miles would be my preference.

 

I did find a '76 triple white Eldorado Fleetwood anniversary convertible with only 100 miles on the odometer. It was purchased and stored and was beautiful from the pictures. The guy wanted $50,000 but I was only, at the time, willing to pay $35,000 which was the highest bid. Oh well, he wanted it more than I did I guess.

6TWON

 

IIRC, it was red with a red interior. Don't recall how much he paid, nor any of the details (engine size, transmisstion, etc.) but he only drove it for a few years, then sold it."

1961	December 19, 2004 10:32PM	stickguy	"Cementing my silver status membership, we picked up a new van for my wife last night (2nd new car this year, so we went from living in the '90s to nothing but '05 in the space of 5 months).

 

Picked up an 'Ody EX-L last night. Amazing the amount of goodies on a family wagon! Drives real nice too.

 

So, in theory, I'm out of the market for a long time. Of course, that won't stop me from looking at all the new stuff coming out, in case soemthing catches my fancy that makes me willing to rationalize trading up from my Scion.

 

Of course, when I suggested trading in my tC on the Ody (so I could go out shopping again), my wife gave me a strange (and none too pleasant) look, so I think I better cool it for now, at least until the van is paid off.

 

Now, just need to sell the '99 Quest to free up driveway space (and cash). Although I may keep it for a few months, so I can keep the tC garaged on snowy days."
1962	December 20, 2004 2:50AM	gee35coupe	I'm looking at getting an 07 Ody. We have a 04 right now. But every time I see the new ones I know I would rather have one of those. As soon as the two leases we have new are up....
1963	December 20, 2004 5:07AM	stickguy	IMO, the '05 is a big upgrade from the prior generation. Just seems more upscale if nothing else.

Boy do I ever want to trade in my truck for this car - it is really nice in all the right ways. But when I got home and took my truck out, I really like that too. Oh, the horns of a dilemma have me squarely in their sights!

 

Perhaps a cheap lease, and keep my truck? Can I in all conscience have three vehicles??!! :-)"
1965	December 20, 2004 1:49PM	racer63	"Finally got out to peek at the '04 TL speed parked at an Infiniti dealer a few miles away.

 

Well, it was pretty beat for 10k miles. Front bumper cover looked to be a slightly different shade than the rest of the car, and was showing a few scrapes here and there. Curb rash on two wheels. Metal trim dented on center console (how do you do that?) Tires rather worn for the miles. In general, not worth pursuing.

 

Next door though at the Acura dealer was an '04 TSX 6 speed, no nav with 8k short miles, and not a scratch on it, Acura CPO'ed, for 23,500. That got my attention a little more, and I may just have to look at this one a little more closely. Keep y'all posted."
1966	December 20, 2004 3:42PM	robr2	Run a carfax. I stumbled across an 04 stick NAV TSX with 2800 miles on it at the local Dodge Emporium. They are asking over $26K. the free Carfax they have shows 7 records on it. That's scary!!
1967	December 20, 2004 3:57PM	stickguy	"Not a bad deal on the '04. You are probably only saving about 2K over a new '05, but you pick up the CPO extended warranty to offset the 1 MY loss and the 8K miles.

 

As to the car fax, the freebie is designed to scare you enough to pay for the real report. When you see one of them, you realize that multiple records are generated quickly at first, as it moves through the various titling steps (dealer to buyer), and can include getting inspected, etc.

 

Plus, if it was traded in for whatever reason, that's a few more records, plus another couple if it went through the auction.

 

Look at the car. if it is what you want, either pay the $20, or ask the dealer to run it. They all seem to have accounts since they pull reports all the time, and should have no problem giving it to you."
1968	December 20, 2004 4:03PM	anonymousposts	"stickguy: You have two of the cars we have lusted after. Gee wanted a tC for a long time. I can't remember why he stopped wanting one of those. And now we are leaning towards buying a new Odyssey once our Accord goes back. We want it primarily for the sunroof, XM capability, dash shifter, and safety equipment.

 

We need to go drive a 2005 Odyssey. We dropped by and took a brief look right after they came out but have not gone back for a more extensive evaluation. Oh well, we have 14 more months before we have to makea decision on our 04."
1969	December 20, 2004 4:11PM	robr2	I know the issues with the carfax. It just that this ultra low mile TSX found it's way onto a Dodge dealer. Makes me think no Acura dealer wants to touch it.
1970	December 20, 2004 4:27PM	racer63	"If I did go for a deal I certainly would spring the 20 dugans to find out the history on the car, especially since '04 TSX's started in 4/03.

 

An '05 is slightly advantageous in that they added a couple of features, like a power passenger seat (no big deal), but also integrated XM radio, which I've come to like alot in my truck. Assuming there is a grand of play in the price of this one, and a like amount int he sticker of new, the savings would be like $4k, maybe $600-800 more factoring the value of the Extended CPO warranty.

 

Problem is rationally, I probably got another 40 or 50k of trouble free miles ahead of me with my 5 year old, 80k Toyota. Decisions, decisions..."
1971	December 20, 2004 6:34PM	gee35coupe	Can't live without it. I have Sirius on my Dish Network subscription but I think I like XM more. That's one of the main reasons I think our driveway will have a totally different look in three years.

1973	December 20, 2004 8:25PM	stickguy	"I think you would like the '05, based on the other cars you have.

 

I actually really want XM, and am bummed that the EX-L doesn't have it integrated. You get it on an Accord EX-l after all. I may get an aftermark set up at some point, since I don't think it is worth the $600 or so bucks that the dealer will charge to hook it up.

 

Kind of false advertising to tout XM ready, when as far as I can tell, the only XM item is the fact that the radio has buttons to select it. None of the equipment to make it work is included."

Who am I kidding. I'll still look at all the new stuff until something really pushes my buttons and makes me do something that my wife will regret (like trading in a barely used tC).

Obviously, it'll have no resale, but what a fun and useful ride.

 

My hypothetical job change I posted about last month is in the process of happening. I'll be driving as part of my deal in what I'll be doing a little more, but the position includes a $400/month car allowance as well as gas card perk. Hmmmmn. But then, the Celica is way cheap to mile up at this point. Who wants an 80+k 5 year old 2 door with a 5 speed and manual windows? I figure I can get a pretty inexpensive 2 more years and 40-50k out of it, and still be able to retail it for $3.5 or 4k. That's only 3 or 4 thousand in depreciation over what it's worth now. That cost plus a set of tires and hopefully just a few miscellaneous repairs. Sure beats another monthly car payment."

We won't talk about how far upside down I am in it at the moment. So there, I'm doing my part on several fronts....at least I like the truck, and my 8 year old does too. He wants us to still have it when he gets his license in 9 years so it can be his first vehicle.

 

If something really really interesting came up, I might jump on it, but for now, I'm good. What I will be buying in the next couple of months is an enclosed car hauler for my race car and the kid's kart. I'll be getting my fix that way."
1979	December 29, 2004 8:15PM	corvette	Is it a diesel? If so, it wouldn't be so terrible as a long-distance commuter.
1980	December 29, 2004 10:22PM	racer63	"When I decided what best suited my needs was a big hiney full size crew cab truck, the next decision was which brand and which motor, keeping in mind Mrs. Racer63 would be driving this a good part of the time Monday-Friday. My past 3 trucks had been Fords, first two great, last one less so. As for Ford gassers, the 5.4 didn't have enough juice, the V10 just seemed excessive, besides none around, and I was wary of the 6.0 diesel issues. That, and my 5'2"" wife would need a stepladder to get in and out, besides the overall manly look. Dodge, well speaking of manly, that was that. We had previously looked at a 6 speed Cummins 2500HD Crew Cab as part of our preliminary shopping, and all of us, kids included, said yuk. Felt like a Peterbilt to drive and ride in. So that left GM, which had the advantages of the softest styling in the GMC, and also the most varied motor choices. I looked at and drove the one Duramax within 100 miles, and the dealer was a highway hassle screamer sort of place, with sales tactics to match (if anyone is familiar with Route 22 in NJ, you'll know what I mean). No Big Blocks around, so that left the 6.0 gas motor, which with 300hp and 360 ft-lb of torque, combined with 4.10 gears, has plenty of haul. Mileage isn't appreciably worse than the 5.0 Exploder this replaced, especially since it is happy on regular, and the Exploder knocked on anything but 92+. 11 around town, 14 on the highway at 75mph. 10-11 towing my 5000 lb car and open trailer combo at 70-75

 

I have a couple of good friends with Duramaxes, and I'm giving up probably 3-5mpg in all conditions. Even at approaching 20mpg, with the cost of diesel lately, it would be a long time if ever to make up the $5k purchase price of the diesel option. That, and no clack clack, or having to plug it in for the single digit nights we've been having lately."
1981	December 30, 2004 12:43AM	nippononly	$663/month? That is a lot to quell the ol' CCB urge. I haven't gone quite that high yet, although who knows...could be any day now! :-)
1982	December 30, 2004 1:13AM	akangl	Have had Zippy (Focus) for just over 5 months and 17k miles, no problems with the car and absolutely no urge to get rid of it. The Titan is leased so it'll be around for a while, the Ram is still holding up fine.......had it over a year now. Guess I'm cured.
1983	December 30, 2004 1:51AM	racer63	"The '99 Exploder before this truck was a full finance, sales tax and all, at 2.9% for 48, amounting to $653/month. I thought that was misery until it was paid off. I had no car payments for 19 months, then taking the first racing trip using the Exploder, after selling the motorhome we were traveling in, realized after that 1 weekend with the family of 4, big dog, kart and racecar in/on open trailer towed behind, and all associated accessories, that a larger truck was an absolute necessity. Mrs. Racer63 thought ""hey, it's free money"", so another similar deal throwing in the tax, doc fee, step bars, bedliner, etc. So now more $$$ per month for a year longer term. Yee ha."
1984	December 30, 2004 2:20AM	corvette	I guess it helps that you're no stranger to high car payments!
1985	December 30, 2004 2:27AM	akangl	$642/mo for the Titan (yard ornament), $234/mo for the Focus, and $402/mo for the Ram (hopefully will have that paid off SOON). We can afford it, but I sure don't like it.
1986	December 30, 2004 3:52AM	anonymousposts	$642 for the Titan? Ouch. We barely pay that much for the lease on our Accord and Odyssey combined. We are counting down the months until the Ody goes back. We will miss it but we won't miss sending the $330 for it every month. Although knowing us we will turn around the next day and lease a 2006 Odyssey EX-L RES.
1987	December 30, 2004 4:22AM	racer63	"On a monster Datsun truck rental? Wow.

 

At least I'll own mine in another 4 1/2 years. I forgot, an extended warranty to 75k miles is in that $660 and change payment too.

 

I looked into leasing the Explorer when I bought it, but the payment with tax would have been $425/month for 36. Another $225, for an additional 12 months seemed like a better deal. I looked at it as a lot of money either way."
1988	December 30, 2004 6:29AM	nippononly	And I thought the $356/mo on my RSX was a lot! Although if I crumble before temptation and lease a new Outback, it will apparently be another $229/mo, so I will be up close to $600/mo combined if so. A scary thought - CCB taking over! :-0
1989	December 30, 2004 11:17AM	andre1969	And I used to whine about the $347.66/mo car payment on my Intrepid!

I almost traded my ML500 last year but decided to keep it for the full warranty period (48 months/50,000 miles). So, I now have a full year to look and see what I want to replace it with.

 

I was really hot for the Cadillac Escalade ESV but now, since they will change in 2007 ( I think), I might consider the Ranger Rover and possibly the Land Rover LR3 with the 3rd seat. I usually go to Los Angeles once a month or so and parking can be mighty tight. The ML works so perfectly for that purpose and is a 7 passenger.

 

The Mercedes ML's are changing for 2006 so that could be a possibility too..... but, I was thinking of changing brands now that I've had 3 Mercedes in a row.

My wife's last job included a $300/mo allowance (no gas card) for 20-25k mile. She was wondering why I was so upset with it as she was driving a car with 135k miles on it.

 

Now she has a company car (alleluia), a gas card and 600 personal miles a month."
1998	December 30, 2004 8:05PM	racer63	"Going into this deal, I casually looked at IRS regs, since I believe that allowance, and probably the gas too, is considered income. I will be keeping a log of personal and business miles driven to see how it all works out. At a minimum, there's alway the unreimbursed business expenses above the 2% floor. Not sure driving this cheap car I'll get above the 2% exclusion. We'll have to see.

 

Way back when I was a wee tyke in this biz (engineering design and construction), I spent a lot of time on the road, with cents per mile reimbursement only. Then, I was good for about 25k miles/year on my primary vehicle, and maybe 5-8k on a play car. In that 30k+ total though was about 10k annually in serious road trips to major autocross events around the country. I did live very close to work though. Extrapolating through, the result is I expect to roll up around 20k per year. This office is much closer than where I'm at now, with the one-way distance only 6-7 miles instead of the there only one more week 17.

 

As for humongous payments, yes, I can afford them, but I don't like them......same thing with my mortgage and property taxes too, I qualify for that ding as well, but one payment there totals almost 4 more of what I'm paying monthly for the truck. Financially, a very effective CCB remedy. :-)"

1) The best method (for tax reporting) is if you are reimbursed for business mileage, preferably at the federal rate. This is NOT considered INCOME.

 

2) If the company provides you a car (not the case here), the driver is responsible for tracking the business mileage, commuting mileage, and the personal mileage. You report that to the employer and the personal and commuting mileage is added to your W-2 (line 7) income.

 

3) What you have here is a non-accountable plan which is a *royal* PITA. All funds provided by the company is considered income and will show up on your W-2. You have to do the mileage tracking and track your expenses. You have two options. First, you can declare the car expenses and allocate them between personal and business use. That is also a pain. The better option is to track the mileage and use the government rate. Either way, it is a rip because you have to get over the 2% threshhold.

That amounts to about 15k, with the other 5k from the short commute to the office, which still counts as business miles. With that 20k at 40.5 cents, that equals $8100, less my $4800 I will be reimbursed, leaving $3100 over and above. Considering the 2% floor, I'll still have a small deduction available. Since this this will support taking the deduction, there are a few other things I can lump in there too, like professional society memberships, that previously I was 100% out-of pocket for.

 

If and when the time for a new car comes, it would likely be a combo of practical and fun, like a 5 speed Accord or a Mazda 6, or even maybe a TSX."
2007	December 31, 2004 2:29PM	nitromax	"Mind your judgements, sir. At my income level having a car payment is an option, and an option I choose. I have no other debt and with both jobs (one I have to do, one is a hobby), I make about $150k a year - I think I can handle it, if you don't mind ME making the decisions about my budget.

 

Why don't you just buy your vehicles outright? Is there a reason why you prefer to make a monthly payment?"
2008	December 31, 2004 3:08PM	andre1969	"for having a car payment, even if you could afford to buy the car outright, is to have the cash available for other purposes such as investing. For instance, if I had an extra $30-40K lying around, but still had adequate income coming in every month, I'd invest that money and take my chances, and just make the monthly payments.

 

I figure I'd rather throw away $600 or $800 one month at a time, instead of the whole $30-40K all at once. Chances are, that $30-40K, invested halfway intelligiently, will be worth more in 5 years than it is now. And if you're lucky, it might be worth near double.

 

Plus, you never know when something might come up where you might need that $30-40K for something more important than a car.

 

In my case, I'd rather have the $30-40K in the bank, a car I owe 5 years on, and a $600-800 car payment, then have the car paid in full, but $30-40K less in the bank. Of course, YMMV..."

If I had car payments, they probably would be $2,500 a month with two Mercedes.

2010	December 31, 2004 3:55PM	andre1969	"the payment on my condo that I recently sold was only about $690. And that was a 15 year mortgage! It sounds a little worse once you add in my HELOC ($100) and condo fee ($239 when I sold it) but heck, I guess $1029 a month total is still chicken feed by today's standards!

 

I hate to think what the total outlay is for the guy who bought it, though. He borrowed 100%, doing an 80% mortgage and a 20% second. Plus the condo fee on top of that!

 

And I'm guessing that some car payments can easily approachh $1000. At least, the way I'm looking at it, I borrowed $20K for my Intrepid for 5 years at 0.9%, and it came out to about $350 per month. So the way I'm looking at it, $40K would run you at least $700 per month, and $60K, at least $1050 per month. Ouch!"

I believe it's a combination of her SS, retirement, and some other annuities, but I'm not sure exactly.

 

Anyway, this guy has basically made a hobby out of going to the dealer and trying to see how good of a deal he can get on a car. Sure, once you factor in the trade he's still going to take a beating, but I've heard he's getting something like $20K per month, so it's not like he's going bankrupt doing it!

 

I can think of plenty of other things I can do with $20K per month, but I guess if this makes him happy, can it be all that bad? And I'm sure it makes more than a few salespeople happy, too!"

2022	January 1, 2005 4:02PM	andre1969	"I just had it taken out automatically. Same with the mortgage on my condo. I used to hate writing out checks every month and mailing them off, but once it got to the point that I could start doing stuff online, it made it a lot easier.

 

In addition to the automatic mortgage and car payment, I started using one of my credit cards to pay for the telephone and cell phone, and now the Directv. When I had cable tv, I could pay online, but it came out of my checking account. Same with the electric.

 

It got to the point that the only two things I couldn't pay online were my condo fee and my HELOC. For some reason though, I got an aversion to buying stamps. I'd actually drop the condo fee payment off at their office, which was conveniently on the way home. And the credit union was about a 10 minute walk from my office, so I'd just walk over on my lunch break to do that one, and get a breath of fresh air.

 

As for COBRA, my uncle has to deal with that every year. He's in construction, doing road work, and usually gets laid off around Christmas, and then picked back up in April. Those COBRA payments are pretty evil! But at least they cover him. He had a kidney transplant back around '87, and is on God-only-knows how many different types of medication, and constantly has to go in for checkups.

As long as we make the distinction between what feels most convenient or comfortable and what is actually the most fiscally sound way to do things. Yes, to some writing a check every month or owing money to someone else is less than ideal. But these negative gut-feelings don't necessarily equate to sound money management.

A few years ago I bought a truck with acid rain damage on it so ever since have been very careful when buying a vehicle. I recently purchased a used car and after a all day test drive, checking out the paint from every angle during the day and carfax bought it. While I needed a car immediately(long story) I thought I checked it out very well, only to find out a few days later the trunk, hood and roof have something on it(not acid rain but the same effect). Found a few other minor things wrong but the paint really bugs me. Mechanically. so far, the car seems fine. With nothing but 3 month drivetrain I'm basically screwed..really feel like a bonehead but wonder if they didn't use some type of colored wax or something to conceal the paint..Oh well, thanks for listening..any thoughts?

In addition to not being able to claim it once you make a certain amount, it also turns out that you can only write off mortgage interest up to $1million ($500K if married filing separate). For a home equity line of credit it's only $100K! ($50K if married filing separate).

 

Yeah, I know, oh the humanity. Believe it or not though, the HELOC thing might actually affect me! I was thinking about taking out one on my house to do some repairs and rennovations, build a garage, etc. And I was thinking about doing one for $150K.

 

I know I could always do a mortgage, to get the higher writeoff level (no whay I'd ever qualify for $1million anytime soon, anyway!), but the reason I want to do an HELOC is that there are no closing costs, no home inspection (and in its current condition, I don't think my place would pass one!), and I like the idea of only taking out what I need. Instead of having to take the whole $150K all at once, I could just do, say, $25K for a garage here, $5K for a new driveway there, $10K for a kitchen remodel, $35K for a Chrysler 300C (oops, did I say that out loud? ;-), and so on!"

If the limit you mentioned is indeed 100K in HELOC interest (the amount you can deduct), then you have nothing to worry about by taking a $150k heloc loan because you will come nowhere close to paying $100k in interest in a year.

And on an HELOC, no matter how much you borrow, you can only write off interest on the first $100,000. So if I took out a $150K HELOC, I could only write off the interest on the first $100K of it, but not the additional $50K.

 

The way I phrased it, it came out that you could write off up to $100,000 of interest per year on an HELOC. Sorry about the mixup!"

My latest Motortrend has a couple pics of an undisguised Charger in it, and the more I look at it, the more I like it. In some ways it's a bit odd, because it looks like they tried to incorporate some Intrepid leftovers into the design, like the taillights and the rear window. And the front still reminds me of some of those old 70's South American Dodges.

 

But if nothing else, I always thought the '98-04 Intrepid had just a hint of Charger in it, with the subtle ""flying buttresses"" built in, and a taillight panel that stretches all the way across, vaguely reminiscent of a '69 or '70 (the '68 had Bel Air-type taillights)

 

Now if they built a 2-door Charger or, better yet a Charger convertible, that would be way cool! Although a Charger 'vert would probably be more than I want to pay. And if ya wanna get pure about it, there never was a Charger convertible, either! I'd probably go for the coupe if they made one, becuase I've always preferred 2-doors in the past.

I have to take it through the emissions test this weekend, which I'm not looking forward to. It should most likely pass, but I always get a bad vibe every time I do into those places...
2062	January 5, 2005 5:08PM	stickguy	"I think if I did something now, it would be a used car, deal too good to pass up type of thing. Or maybe a lease on something interesting, which at least would keep me out of the market for a while.

 

I started thinking about slightly used 3 series wagons again. For some reason, I always liked these. Maybe when the new model comes out they'll have a lease blow-out sale? Not that you can find a 5 speed sport package anyway, but it doesn't hurt to look.

 

I actually never have quite found a sweet spot with the tC front seat. it's not bad, but I don't get that ""I wanna sit here all day"" feeling. Maybe I should just go buy a Volvo and be done with it."
2063	January 5, 2005 5:36PM	andre1969	"with a lot of newer cars, is that the steering wheel is off-center with the seat. Whassupwitdat? I think I'd have problems adjusting to that after awhile. One car, the BMW 6-series, was extra-bad. In addition to having the steering wheel off-set, it was angled so that the left side of it was further away from me than the right side! Now, maybe there's something I'm missing, and it's adjustable in directions that I never before imagined?!

 

I have seen this problem in older cars as well, though. For instance, the '91-96 Caprice and their ilk always seemed a bit off-center to me. They made those cars wider inside than the preceding '77-90 models, but it feels like the seat is wider, with the contouring putting you a bit more to the left side of the car, but the steering wheel is in the same spot that it was with the older cars. End result is that the steering wheel is a bit to the right of your butt!"

======================

None that I can think of... I know lot of peopple that do it that way. At the level of competition I play at, the shelf life of a stock category car is typically only around 3 years anyway until something better/faster superceeds it in a respective class. The only real go fast parts necessary are custom shocks, and occassionally exhaust, and tires on stock size wheels. All easily removable and replaced with the oem stuff at turn-in time.

The Focus does great until there is 6-8 inches of snow on the highway, then its a battle, it'll still go, but the snow throws it all over the road. Now my Titan is by far the best 4WD I've ever had, although I rarely need the 4WD even in deep snow."

I will drive it tomorrow probably. We need to give the poor Si a break. It usually gets driven 6 days a week, sometimes 7, at at least 40 miles per day.

It was torture.
2085	January 6, 2005 1:54AM	anonymousposts	The 26,000 on the Si isn't bad by itself but to that you have to add 20,000 miles on the first 04 Accord auto we traded (it was bought 2 weeks before the Si) for the 04 Accord manual which now has 8200 miles on it. Add to that the 04 Ody which has 8800 miles on it and you have a total of 63,000 miles in the last 15 months. Wow. I didn't even realize we drove THAT much.

When we originally did the deal it was cheaper to lease it at the time, we also planned on buying it at the end. So far its been a pretty good truck, I'm not complaining. More I drive it the more I like it, especially on crappy roads.

2089	January 6, 2005 3:23AM	204meca	after 18K miles. I am seriously considering this model. Is it an 04 or O5? Which engine do you have 2.0 or 2.3? Automatic or manual? Do you track your gas mileage -- if yes, what is it. Thanks!
2090	January 6, 2005 4:18AM	akangl	"Actually I have a ZX3 (same car basically) and I think its the best car in the world!! I have the 2.0 Zetec engine and a manual transmission. Its been perfect, NO problems at all!!

 

I do track my gas mileage and so far the best was 35 mpg on a highway trip and the worst was 25 mpg with lots of idling and 35 below zero temps. Generally the average is around 30 mpg hwy driving. I drive the car 1000 miles per week and have never had a problem with it.

 

It started the other day at 20 below zero without being plugged in (engine block heater). Its a great car!!! I would HIGHLY recommend it!

 

Only reason I grumble a litte about it is its front wheel drive and when there's 8 inches of snow on the highway its a handful, but still goes no matter what.

 

Its never used a drop of oil, I run synthetic in it and change the oil filter ever 12,500 miles, the oil every 25,000 miles.

 

No regrets, cost us $11k brand new out the door, best car for the money! It was an impulse buy, but the only one we have never regretted (ok, ok, I do wish sometimes it was AWD)."

jolie, I'm with you, I really like the Focus. We've got the 2.0 Zetec with a stick as well (except ours is the ZX5 with a few more creature comforts) and we've been averaging right at 30MPG.

 

My only complaint, and it's been quite noticable the past couple of days, is that there needs to be maybe another inch of legroom. When I have to clutch often, my ankles starts to cramp just a bit.

 

Besides that, we've been quite impressed. The hatchback is really quite versatile, it's fun to drive. I can't imagine what it would be like in 8"" of standing snow, but yeah, I can see the case for AWD.

 

BTW, we're supposed to get up to 30 today .... break out the short sleeves and sandles!"
2093	January 6, 2005 4:13PM	andre1969	with the Focus: legroom. The car seems to get most of its interior volume from its height, but if you're a taller driver with long legs who likes to stretch out, then a high ceiling isn't going to do you much good!
2094	January 6, 2005 4:19PM	michaellno	"don't misunderstand me ... 98% of the time, the Focus is just fine. The past couple of days has seen very heavy traffic on my commute and there has been a lot of stop-and-go on the highway, so I'm using the clutch a lot more. The only other time I've noticed a legroom issue was on a spur of the moment trip to Cheyenne -- about 150 miles one way. Even with the CC on, I had an issue keeping my legs comfortable.

 

And I've only got a 30"" inseam!

 

What I need to remember is that the Focus will eventually go to my daughter, when she learns to drive a stick. Currently, she's using the L300 to go to and from school and work. We want her to get experience driving in bad weather with an auto tranny and not have to worry about clutching and downshifting and what not on top of it all.

 

When that happens, probably this summer, I'll get my L300 back, which is much more comfortable for me."

The AWD drive is absolutely amazing. My nephew and his girlfriend have a Nissan Xtera that is only a 2x4. They couldn't go anywhere.

  

Jolie, I'm surprised that you can get around so well in a front wheel drive car in 8 inches of snow. With the ice that we had back home, front wheel drive cars had only a ""min-ute"" advantage if any. I felt like my Mercedes could go anywhere, but, stopping on ice is still a bit difficult with a 6,600 lb vehicle... but, I love those ABS brakes.

They have gotten me where ever I have needed to go in the Celica, including up my driveway which is 100' long and a 10% grade in the middle of it.

In more powdery stuff, I have driven through snow so deep, I had it coming over the hood.

 

If you are experienced in the bad stuff, I know I prefer my manual tranny, no nannys for brakes or traction front drive car with snow tires. Lots of feel for what the tires and brakes are doing, and sometimes depending on conditions, locking the brakes is a good thing."

2106	January 11, 2005 8:47AM	andyman73	A former coworker of mine used to refinance her home every 3-5 years, and buy a new car. They always got the 15 year loan, and a new car and truck. I couldn't understand the need to do it that often, but maybe they're closet CCBers. I tried to convince the boss/wife, to do that, but MIL talked her out of it. Said something about what if you lose the house, you'll lose the car too, or something. IN laws are millionaires, so they can buy a new car when ever they chose, without thinking of how to pay for it. I always have to tell wifey that some of her parents opinions are a little off. Since money is growing on their trees, they don't really know what it's like to make the money last, or they just have forgotten what it was like. And I only wanted to buy a leftover 03 SVT Focus for 15K.
2107	January 11, 2005 9:17AM	andyman73	About 7 years ago, I was driving my Honda Civic hatch, just after a heavy snow and ice storm. Had about 8 inches of hard frozen crap on the back roads. I was just driving a long in the ruts, until they went off the road. Couldn't get out of the ruts, so, followed them off into a corn field. Dropped her into first, kept it at quarter throttle, and did a lazy donut. Got back up on the road, a little muddy but okay. And motored on my way. Them skinny 175/70/13s worked pretty good in the slop.

Corvette, I did the math and our total monthly expenditure wouldn't change. Have enough equity in home to refi and get enough to buy decent mid 30K vehicle outright. And Mortgage payments wouldn't change. According to the rep at our current mortgage co. So, it would have worked out great.

 

However, I didn't want to rock the boat, wife is only child, and someday those greenback bearing trees will be ours. So I don't push my luck."

And you would be financing an automobile over 15 years.... or 30 (perish the thought).

 

Get a HELOC and set up the payment plan properly; that's a much better idea. Or save up and pay cash :-)

 

-Mathias"
2113	January 12, 2005 6:26PM	andre1969	"you can do a refinance and work it to your advantage, so it can fuel your CCB habit. I refinanced my condo back in 1999, but not with the intent of buying a car. What I did was refinance to a lower rate, and paid down just enough to get to an 80% LTV ratio, which allowed me to drop the mortgage insurance. That saved me about $230 a month on my payment, although once you factored in the tax consequences, it was probably more like a $180-200 savings.

 

Well, a few months later, when I was looking at this brand-new 2000 Intrepid, I got to thinking that $347.66 a month ain't bad, especially considering that I just re-did my mortgage to save $230 a month. So that was part of the way I talked myself into it, by convincing myself that my total monthly outlay for all expenses wouldn't be much more than it was a few months ago. And once you figure in the fuel savings of that Intrepid versus my Gran Fury, and how much I drove back then, my total outlay was probably about the same!

 

I'm in the process of doing an HELOC right now. They told me I could qualify for $25K more than what I wanted, and foolishly I accepted. Hey, it's only going to hurt if I actually BORROW up to the max, and nobody says I HAVE to do that!

 

I'm going to try and keep car payments and purchases off the HELOC, though. I stress ""try"" ;-)"

Statements like that have no place in the CCB room.

 

andy: If you still want that SVT Focus you can get a slightly used one pretty cheap now. Depreciation remained high despite the limited production. I was surprised to find a Civic Si held it's value better despite some of them acting as lot fillers at Honda dealerships.

 

We are going to retrieve our Accord today. FINALLY! The 04 Galant I had as a rental was OK the first day, not that bad the second day, and ""OMG I can't wait to get my Accord back"" by the third day I drove it."
2115	January 12, 2005 6:52PM	anonymousposts	We have one HELOC through our original lender and another through our current lender. We refinanced last April through our credit union at a fixed rate of 4.1% for 15 years and they had a similarly good deal on the HELOC so we paid off the original HELOC with the second HELOC and have since paid off the second HELOC. I usually forget that we have them which is a good thing but I think Gee is too responsible to use the HELOC for a car anyways.
2116	January 12, 2005 6:57PM	andre1969	"4.1% fixed for 15 years! How'd you manage to swing that? The HELOC I'm getting is Prime + 1/4 for life. I could have gotten Prime through my credit union, but they've been pissing me off lately. Plus, the place I'm going through will do it with no appraisal or home inspection, and no closing costs. All they're concerned about is my income.

 

The CU would have wanted a home inspection, and I honestly don't think that my home would pass in its current condition. And the main reason I want the money is to fix up the place, so it's like I'd be stuck between a rock and a hard place with the CU!"

2119	January 12, 2005 7:28PM	andre1969	"my credit union is currently offering 3.60% on a new car loan. My HELOC is going to start off at 5.5%. Now I can write that off, though (at least the first $100,000 of it), but in my tax bracket that would get it down to effectively 3.7125%. Still better to just take out a car loan!

 

Besides, the people at my CU who handle car loans are different from the mortgage people, so I probably wouldn't have to deal with the attitude."

""Statements like that have no place in the CCB room.""

 

Sure... with $5k cash you can buy and sell cars like candy... ask me how I know... not much in the way of sales tax to worry about, either.

 

kyfdx: Don't forget two advantages of the HELOC:

- tax savings

- no lien on the title, making it easier to sell AND BUY ANOTHER ONE

 

4.5 at 15 yrs is outstanding; best I could do was 4.75 on a 10 yr, and that was the bottom in these parts.

 

And then there's that HELOC just waiting for me to buy something... present balance: $0. Life's tough...

2121	January 13, 2005 12:56PM	andre1969	"now I'm a bit peeved at the mortgage company. This HELOC that was supposed to be ""no closing costs""? Well, I got the paperwork for it last night and started just blindly signing through stuff. Then, I started reading through the fine print, and one of the lines said something about paying closing costs that could range between $0 and $3000. At first I didn't think anything of it, since they said there were no closing costs and, well, that DOES fall between $0 and $3000! But then, just out of curiosity, I looked back. Sure enough, they stuck in about $2600 worth of closing!

 

I also found out that they're going to charge me $50 per year to keep this account open. Now I know $50 a year is paltry compared to borrowing $100,000 or more. But still, it annoyed me.

 

I'm going to call them this morning when they open up, and find out what's going on. But at the same time, I might just check into my CU and see what kind of hoops they'd make me jump through. Sure, their underwriter has been a bit of a jerk, but they'd most likely be cheaper. And hey, $2600 could buy several of the types of cars that I like! ;-)"

2125	January 13, 2005 3:36PM	kyfdx	"Agreed.. but...(isn't there always a but with my posts?).

 

tax savings... On a $20K car, negligible, considering a regular car loan probably has a lower rate, and is fixed.. At this time, I'd say the chances of the HELOC rate going up are pretty good over the next year..

 

No lien on title.. excellent point.. To keep things simple, I usually buy a car by writing a check on my HELOC, then doing the financing thing later at my leisure.. Then, when I'm ready to sell the car, I pay off the car loan with a check from my HELOC, leaving it unencumbered and ready for quick sale.

 

Granted... If buying $5K cars, I'd rather not have a lien on the title, whether I've financed it or not.... My examples are more for the $10K and up deals..

 

Mortgage.. I had my mortgage with a local bank.. I was already at 5.25%.. Last March, when rates got to 4.75%, I would call them each morning.. If you are an existing customer, you can lock a rate over the phone with a $295 app fee on your credit card... It hit 4.5% for exactly two days.. I grabbed it.. It was the first time I ever got in at the bottom (Lived in house six years.. on my fourth mortgage). Needless to say... I was pretty happy.

I speak from personal experience, and I may have said this before, and I know it sounds elitist, but it seems like in rural areas it's often difficult to find businesses that will do quality work. There are exceptions, and there are plenty of businesses in populous areas that do crappy work, as well, but at least there is a larger sample size to choose from.

 

I will typically put up with more horse fertilizer than I should have to, but at a certain point, there's no turning back or redemption, and I won't set foot inside the business again. If it means not owning a Nissan/VW/BMW/whatever in a certain geographic area, so be it. It's not worth putting up with certain people and their incompetence just to have the pleasure of owning a great automobile."

I told hubby that I REFUSE to go back into that dealer, so either we take it to Anchorage or HE takes it in when it has to go. I can't deal with the stress anymore.

 

They have totally ruined it for me and I will never own another Nissan. I will probably go back to Chevy (maybe, will check out the service dept first) or Ford (safe bet there, the service dept is TOP NOTCH!!!)

 

I honestly expected much better from Nissan, I mean Toyota brought out the Tundra and I don't remember it having issues like this. Of the 2 vehicles I own, I really expected problems from the Focus, but have had none. I never expected the poor quality and crappy dealer service from Nissan.

I've used and abused it, and it keeps on ticking. I would venture that Nissan is still competitive in the 3-year Vehicle Dependability Study (of course, the problem children Armada and Titan aren't 3-years old yet)... It's a shame you have a bum dealer, it sounds like you could deal with the car if it weren't for the bad customer service. Guess you don't plan on buying it at the end of the lease anymore?

 

Autoweek did an article on Ghosn a few weeks ago, trumpeting Nissan's turnaround, and their supposedly rapid response to (and resolution of) the quality problems in the Canton plant.

            I think Ghosn has done a fine job considering all the new models and design changes in the market ... that said, the truck market is a ""TUFF"" market and a whooole different enchilada .... unfortunately, Aka is having problems with her 2nd Titan and she's not alone ...

 

             Ever since the hurricanes, we've had roofers, plumbers, carpenters, etc etc that have come down here from all of the storm damage that needs to be fixed .. and you probably see (pick a number) 5/10 Titans a day on different job sites .. the problem is, these guys are not at the beach or sporting around, they're carrying 2000lbs of roof shingles, 500lbs of paint, wood and ladders, 1,000lbs of tools and wire gauge, they use the 4x4 to get on and off the sand or asphalt and the air conditioners are running all the time, I guess a good testing ground for any truck - unfortunately, the Titans aren't doing so well ... they're busting differentials, compressors, power windows, trannys and the V8's cant handle the loads in the heat and they're in the service departments and missing work ..

 

                    Not waving anyones flag here, I like the Nissan products and they have yeeears of a great track record for reliabilty and durability --- But - in the meantime, you see plenty of 5 year old Chevy's, Dodges and Fords that haven't missed a heartbeat ..... it's a ""Tuff"" market, that full size truck market and sometimes the ""glitz"" isn't as important as the job .. we will have to see what happens in the next few year, thats a tough nut to crack ...

My uncle traded his just-paid off '94 GMC stripper Sierra on a used, low mileage, loaded-up '94 GMC 3/4 ton, extended cab, long bed, 4wd Diesel Sierra. This was around September of 1996. I think it only had like 20,000 miles on it.

 

I think that truck ended up going back in the shop more times than any other vehicle I've ever known! It was never the engine or tranny itself, but always some kind of valve, sensor, computer component, or other peripheral thing going bad.

 

He finally gave up on it and traded it in May or so of '97, on a new Silverado with the 4.3 V-6. Thankfully trucks don't depreciate like cars do, so while he was upside down on it, he didn't take too serious of a bath!"

2143	January 15, 2005 3:57PM	akangl	"Terry, you hit it pretty good. The Titan is a nice truck, but I think Nissan forgot to research reliability on these things.

 

My second one is a good truck for the most part, but I have a hard time with a truck that's been back to the shop twice in 4k miles. Especially when I'm driving a Ford Focus 1k miles/week and it hasn't been back for anything but an alignment (typical on these roads) in 18k miles.

 

One of hubby's friends bought an F-150 right before I got the second Titan, he has not been back to the shop once.

 

What's worse for us Titan owners is these issues are killing resale value, I couldn't trade out of my Titan without a whole lotta $$$$ down. I'm just glad the dern thing is leased, may have been the smartest move I ever made. All I gotta do is take care of it and keep the miles down, then its NMAC's problem at the end of the lease. Residual is $17,180 on a 48 mo/48k mile lease.......do I think a 4 year old Titan will be worth that at the end? Nope, not in this lifetime.

 

The later build date trucks are better, however, they aren't even close to the quality of Toyota, Ford, or even GM.

 

I'm going to send extra lease payments and hopefully get out of the truck a year early, go to a Dmax at that point or maybe a Ford. Get a truck that is willing to work without falling to peices.

2151	January 16, 2005 12:11PM	racer63	"BTDT, just a few months a go.

 

I looked at Burbs, Excursions, the big 3 Crew cabs, and the Titan, with the only requirements really being 4 door, 5-6' of cargo floor, and a real-world towing capacity around 8000 lbs.

 

The sentimental favorite in concept going in were Suburbans, but, if you can believe it, they were too small inside for what needed to go in. An X-Box, while OK size wise, felt really ponderous and heavy, besides being wallowy on its 3/4 ton springs with 7000+ lbs of curb weight. It was a chore to drive 40mph and keep it between the stripes on the test drive. Some where in there, drove a Cummins Quad Cab Dodge with a 6-speed. With that powertrain, I thought I was taking an 18-wheeler driving school. Scratch. Next up was a Titan. Hmmn, now we're getting somewhere. Price was definitely right, drove nice, good to look at, and seamless powertrain. This was however, back in the late Spring time frame, and the rumors were starting to abound on how fragile the diff was under hard use, not to mention all the bits and pieces issues. Also, when looking at GVW, towing weight, and GCWR, that 9000lb advertised towing weight really wasn't.

 

So, left with Ford or GM crew cab pick-ups, I kind of halfway wanted a diesel, based on the fct it would be a no excuses tow vehicle. Mrs. racer63 however, who would be driving the beast everyday, was not thrilled with smellly diesel fuel, potentially having to plug it in during cold spells, besides the general click and clack it. would make. I wasn't excited about what the option cost either, all for another 3mpg. Since the Ford 5.4 was sort of wimpy, I ended up with a GM 6.0 gas 2500HD. Nothing showy about it at all, but with 1-ton running gear, the mechanical bits and pieces should last forever. 4L80E tranny, rear axle rated from the supplier at over 10,000lbs, 2950lbs of load capacity 9200lb GVW, less 6250lb curb weight). The only thing I've heard bad about the 6.0 gas is piston slap. Never read a story of one blowing up because of it, and mine doesn't make the noise anyway. I have had other cars slapped, and it made no difference on longevity.

 

Jolie, good luck on getting the Titan right, and just ride it out until the lease is up. Maybe look into a warranty for that 12/12 between the time between the 3/36 and the 4/48's up though...."

Believe me, I regret the day I walked into that dealer back in June. I should have bought the Chevy we looked at I guess or kept driving down the road to the Toyota dealership or maybe just kept my Explorer......it wasn't that bad.

 

I'm just sick about this whole thing, I never thought I'd get tangled up in such a nightmare. Its not like I'm being overly picky, I can live with little things and usually do. However, when the engine knocks so loud you can hear the truck running when you go inside a building and the power windows groan and get stuck down, well, those are things I just can't ignore.

 

Pretty sad when my $11k Focus has never had a problem, never been back to the dealer for anything other than an alignment, and is always willing to go after 6 mos and 19k miles.

After a great deal of fighting with GM, they gave him a whole new engine with the updated design.

The one thing I haven't managed in these deals is getting both the sell and buy closings within 2 months of each other, let alone the same day. 7-8 weeks of homelessness both times. Kind of like selling you car and having to ride the bus till your new ride comes in.

Not sure exactly what the deal is, the service advisor (few bricks shy of a load) says its a valve assembly, ok, so is it the emissions part that they originally thought or is it a valve in the engine. Who knows, will find out more when hubby goes in there Friday and talks to the tech. If its not driveable I'm going to clean it out and leave it there. If it is, well, we'll take it and hope I guess.

Got the plates for the VUE today ... almost $500. $300+ of that was the personal property tax that Colorado levies.

 

Now, I've got to renew the registrations on the L300 and Focus ... another $500 between the two.

 

And, to top it off, they are all due in January!

 

(That's the downside of buying all your cars in the same month...)

 

The wife and I kicked around the idea of buying a new house last summer, but then our oldest moved out, giving us the extra room we needed. So, I suspect we're staying put for the time being."

My '79 NYer would've been close to $200 if I didn't get historic tags for it. But even those have gone up. For ages it was $27.00 for two years, but now it's jumped to about $53. Nasty jump, percentage wise, but still a drop in the bucket overall."

And, to top it off, there is a sales tax that ranges from 6-8% depending on where you purchase your goods and services (state + county + city sales tax - where I live, it's something like 7.8%).

 

When I first moved to Colorado in 1993, I leased a Honda Accord. When writing up the paperwork, the finance guy asked me what county I lived in. He told me the sales tax rate for the deal was based on my address."

I tell ya...our move we're planning will be dictated in part by the tax structure of the two states we're looking at. I know what Texas has, but have to research Idaho.

 

With 3-4 vehicles, a decent house, and good wages, these taxes can easily make a $10k difference per year."
2172	January 25, 2005 4:42PM	jlawrence01	"You have to be very careful when planning a move that you know about ALL of the taxes.

 

For example, Ohio and Missouri have very similar STATE income taxes. However, in Ohio, each city levies a city income tax on income earned IN the city AND income on its residents. So if you live in Cleveland and live in a suburb, you pay local taxes to **BOTH** cities. If you don't know this, you may be paying as much as an additional 4% without factirong that into your new salary.

 

Some states levy taxes on personal property. On some, it it actually a percentage of the value of the vehicle. For me, that's cool as I drive beaters BUT if you are a car collector, you'll be shelling out a lot more.

 

Ditto on property taxes. I have seen $2000 differences between identically priced $150k houses that are actually located within ONE mile of each other.

 

Personally, I always contact the State Society of CPAs of the state that I am moving to so that I know the facts, all the facts, and nothing but the facts (g)."

Of course, she grew up in Wyoming, which also has no state income tax. If there were any jobs up there, we might actually consider it!

By that time, the same home probably would've run you close to $225K or so around my neighborhood, and the only thing extra it would've had would be a basement.

As for all this tax and vehicle registration fees talk, I'll add to what Stickguy said. I'm in North Jersey, and car registration is about the only thing cheap in this state. 6% sales tax, except on unprepped food and clothes; state income tax, totalling about 2% of gross; but the big kicker is property taxes, which dinged me to the tune of $9200 last year. Up until a few years ago, I worked in NYC, and got to deal with paying New York State, and NYC income taxes to. Full coverage car insurance is running me $1200-1500 per vehicle too. My plan at the moment is to have my house paid off by the time my 1st grader is out of college, cash out of it, and if I still need benefits, go work at Wal-Mart, Home Depot or Lowes, or something zero stress.

All of our cars are either in gee's name only or in both names with him first so we had to pay for all of them at the same time. We pay sales tax based on the county we live in which for us is 6% right now. Taxes on groceries are 2% I think and being slowly phased out to 0%.Our property taxes are pretty reasonable. Maybe $700 a year on our house. We also pay state income tax. It doesn't come up to much though. Not sure of the exact percentage.

 

However, the cost of living is pretty cheap where we live. If I would find a job closer to here then we would save a lot of money. However, the only jobs around here are either service jobs (AC repair, plumbing, etc) or McDonalds. We could also move closer but the cost of housing near where I work is rapidly rising so we had better move fast if we plan on getting a nice house for less than $250,000 any where within 10 miles of where I work.

 

I will say that gee did drive the Lexus more before we had little gee. We would usually drive it to dinner once, the annual auto show, and he would drive it to see his dad in S. GA once a year. However, since the Lexus doesn't have LATCH for our son's car seat we haven't driven it much over the last 9 months.

 

drift:A 02-04 Civic Si would also be a good choice. I know I'm biased but the Si is a hoot to drive, has cruise, ABS, sunroof, CD,etc. Ours has been an awesome car over the last year and a half."

Excise Tax - on cars is 2.5% of value annually. Most cars at 5 years old are valued at less than $2,000.

 

Registration - is something like $40 for 2 years.

 

Property Tax - depends on the town. My town has lots of clean commercial development - office parks, corporate headquarters, malls, et al so residents get a cut rate on their taxes - less than $9/$1,000 in valuation (which is about 1 year behind). I pay about $4,000.

 

Income Tax - 5.25% after all deductions.

 

Car Insurance - about $750 per car but the pricing is regulated by the state.

We have 4.5% sales tax and 8.5% for food purchases in restaurants, etc., IIRC. Our governor's race is in November, and the issue that will shape the race is to finish abolishing VA's car tax. It was designed to be phased out completely (first $20K of a car's value IIRC) by a sliding scale over a few years, but it stopped at 70% in the early 00's due to budget deficit. Now the state seems to be generating more revenue than predicted (increased property taxes no doubt!), so the likely republican candidate wants to abolish it completely. Democratic governor says not yet, etc. Should be interesting to follow as the election gets closer.

 

Since I purchased three new GM cars in the last two years, the quick domestic car depreciation curse should help me have no car tax if that initiative does continue forward! LOL!

 

I am fortunate to own a second home in Delaware, which is the home of tax-free shopping. Guess where I do most of my shopping? And their property tax rates are just cheap!

Remote Car Keys.......... Very Interesting Information

 

Handy bit of trivia to know.

 

For those of you who have a car that can be unlocked by that remote button on your key ring: If you lock your keys in the car and the spare keys are home, and you don't have ""OnStar,"" here's your answer to the problem!

 

If some one has access to the spare remote at your home, call them on your cell phone (or borrow one from someone if the cell phone is locked in the car too!)

 

Hold your (or anyone's) cell phone about a foot from your car door and have the other person at your home press the unlock button, holding it near the phone on their end.

 

Your car will unlock.

 

Saves someone from having to drive your keys to you. Distance is no object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you can reach someone who has the other ""remote"" for your car, you can unlockthe doors (or the trunk, or have the ""horn"" signal go off, or whatever!)

Property taxes don't know houses were too expensive

 

Moved to Houston almost three years ago.

Income tax 0

Sales tax 8.25% (2% of food)

Property tax ~2.5% after homestead exemption (prim residence break) on a 180k home I pay roughly 4400 in taxes. However for 180k I get 4/2.5/2 2600+ sq ft on a 65x125ft lot.

 

To me it was well worth the move in addition to it being cold today (50F) and not having to shovel snow or deal with near and sub zero temps. However it does get a tad warm in the summers :-)

 

All this helped me buy 3 cars since I've been here (had to get back on topic)"

2226	January 28, 2005 12:27AM	guss	"I think this is an internet myth. I got the same e-mail awhile ago and as luck would have it I locked my keys in my car. Of course I also had the engine running.

 

Anyway I called my wife and tried this thru my cell phone . No luck , maybe because the car was running? So I had to borrow my Dad's car and drive home to get the second set of keys. About a half hour round trip and face my wife standing there with the keys laughing at me.

 

Strange part was I got one of the best mpgs out of a tank of gas.

 

This would be a good one for Myth Busters."
2227	January 28, 2005 12:30AM	fintail	I thought it seemed a little suspect, but I had to pass it on. I doubt it is true as well.

Seems to me like it would be pretty easy to check out ...

 

Unfortunately, I don't have a car with a remote to test it. The problem with being low-tech."
2229	January 28, 2005 4:56AM	driftracer	"out of curiosity, on both vehicles - one is a Saturn Ion Redline, the other a Dodge Dakota 4x4 - both have factory keyless entry with alarms. Tried the cellphone to cellphone, home phone to cellphone, and home phone to home phone - none of the worked, whether the key fob was locked inside the car or in the house (the extra one)...

 

Doesn't work, in my opinion, but such a neat idea, I wanted to check it out."
2230	January 28, 2005 2:14PM	fintail	Oh well, it sounded fun, and I can't try it myself. Another urban legend then.
2231	January 28, 2005 2:21PM	driftracer	"I had my youngest son hiding in the laundry room, far away from the vehicles, we had three phones going, my oldest son running interference..the wife was shaking her head and laughing at us.

 

I guess we've been watching too many episodes of Myth Busters on the Discovery Channel."
2232	January 28, 2005 2:23PM	fintail	It would have been cool if it worked. I was thinking about it from the start and it seemed flawed. I would assume a keyless fob transmits a radio signal, not some inaudible sound signal. If it transmitted sound, this might work...but radio, no, as I don't think a phone could act as some kind of repeater.
2233	January 28, 2005 2:30PM	jlawrence01	"Just glad to see that one of you guys decided to test the theory. I would have been up all night thinking about it (g).

2236	January 28, 2005 5:20PM	driftracer	"Myth Busters is a COOL show on the Discovery Channel and many times, automotive urban legends are tested.

 

In a recent episode, they chained the rear differential of a police car to a steel pole and drove it away, to see if it would yank the rear end out from underneath like it happened in American Grafitti...

 

Took them 5 tries, and still didn't get a clean break, so it was an obvious stunt that was pre-coordinated - further stories of people doing this trick to their hometown Barney Fife's are obvious hogwash..."
2237	January 28, 2005 6:56PM	guss	"When they put an entire pig in a Corvette to decompose for 2 months to see if you can still sell a car after somebody has died in a car.

 

It was pretty disgusting after 2 mos. locked in the car and inside a storage trailer. Maggots had destroyed the entire interior, leather and all.

 

But, a wholesaler did by the car for parts(I think it was a '91). He said it smelled funny but all he wanted was the mechanical parts anyway.

 

I am not sure if this busted the myth that you could cover up the smell if someone died in a car."

2240	January 28, 2005 7:40PM	andre1969	"that I ever saw a car lose its axle from being tied to a pole was on an episode of ""Leave it to Beaver"", where they did it to Lumpy's old hooptie. (I know they didn't call them hoopties back then, but the other word is escaping me at the moment)

 

I think they might've done it once in ""Happy Days"", too (unless that's ""American Graffiti"" I'm thinking of?), and I'm sure I saw it on ""BJ and the Bear"" when I was a kid.

 

I replaced a rear-end on a '68 Dart once, as well as a leaf-spring on a '57 DeSoto. Now you might be able to do some more serious damage to a more modern setup, but when you figure how huge the U-bolts are that connect the rear-end to the leaf-springs, and then the size of the bolts that connect the leaf springs to the car itself, I'm sure it would take a lot of force to pull the whole rear-end out from under you!

 

Besides, even if you could snap the U-bolts holding the axle to the leaf-springs, the rear still won't come completely out without tearing through the leaf springs, or ripping the body mount.

 

hey Drift, what kind of police car did Myth Busters use?"

Plus it's arid where I am, meaning there are lots of great classic cars and trucks all over, rust-free and cheap. You'd have a field day, Akangl. :-)

2248	February 1, 2005 3:01PM	andre1969	do they insulate the houses up in Alaska? My house gets really drafty once temps drop down below around 20 or so, so I hate to think how it would fare in negative temps! Then again, my house was built before insulation was invented, so that's part of the problem! :-P
2249	February 1, 2005 3:19PM	nippononly	"picked up my sister's old CRX. The sale price of ""free"" turned into almost $600 for overdue maintenance and a couple of repairs, which had to be completed before it would pass the requisite smog check allowing me to transfer ownership...also a pair of tires. Still it is a very sound little car and a real blast to drive. There isn't a car built today that connects you as much to the driving experience as this one, except maybe something like the Lotus Elise. The CRX's curb weight is less than 2000 pounds! It kinda feels like driving one of the old English Minis (NOT the new BMW ones).

 

And then there were three - when I get up to five cars again I will have to sell one. :-P"
2250	February 1, 2005 3:38PM	stickguy	I'll give you $600 for the CRX if it helps you out.

2252	February 1, 2005 5:11PM	corvette	"Dad had a 1990 CRX Si, and still says it's the best car he's ever owned. Sold it way too soon--only 185,000 miles. The 1991 Civic Si that replaced it went 250,000 before he sold it; I saw the same CRX on the road for at least five years after he sold it.

 

No ABS, no airbags, manual windows, mirrors, locks, but it was a fun car!"
2253	February 1, 2005 6:06PM	nippononly	"and the best part of all: manual steering! Being released from the encumbrance of a power steering pump allows the car to give really good steering feedback, not to mention the benefit of less drag on that tiny 1.5L engine - 91 hp, I believe it was in 1987. R&T apparently tested one that year and got an 8.5 second time for the 0-60, with the quarter mile in the 16s. That's just OK today, but was pretty good back then.

 

This thing has 140K, and I could easily see it going past 200K without breaking a sweat. I took some compression numbers when I replaced the spark plugs and got 150 or better across the board (original spec 156 pounds). It revs so easily to 5000 rpm. It always seems to want more.

 

I might even check into why the sunroof isn't working, if I get a free hour some weekend."

2263	February 3, 2005 12:18AM	racer63	"The family relation to the CRX, except in the hatchback 3-door body with a real back seat, and a pop-out sunroof instead of the slider. Stiffer rear springs, and a slightly longer wheelbase, so it handled even better.

 

Unfortunately, any decent examples here in the Northeast have rusted into oblivion."
2264	February 3, 2005 12:25AM	ghulet	"...when I was delivering pizzas a few years ago, a friend of mine sold his '88 CRX Si to one of my co-workers, I think for $600. It looked a bit shabby, had an oil leak, I don't think the a/c or sunroof worked, but ran fine, which is a lot to ask at that price any more. I think my friend sometimes still wishes he had that car, he bought a '98 SAAB 900 turbo as a replacement, which is a nice car and quite fast, but not so cheap to fix when it needs it, naturally.

 

Heck, I wish I had that car now, I could use a cheap little grocery getter sometimes."
2265	February 3, 2005 3:09AM	gee35coupe	For the same reasons you guys are talking about those CR-X's. The FX's interior was luxurious compared to those Hondas though.
2266	February 3, 2005 3:30AM	kyfdx	"I had a girlfriend with an FX once... Not the nifty FX-16, though....

 

Seems like all my girlfriends were missing the ultra nifty features..."
2267	February 3, 2005 5:02AM	corvette	"...he bought a '98 SAAB 900 turbo as a replacement...but not so cheap to fix when it needs it, naturally.

 

When it needs it, frequently..."
2268	February 3, 2005 6:33AM	nippononly	"from what I remember, those FX-16 GTS's were just about identical inside to the Civic SI of the day, in terms of amenities and space. Wonderful little cars, both. I suppose being a Toyota, the FX's sunroof was optional, whereas on the SI the moonroof was standard, I believe. I can't remember if the FX-16 had a full set of gauges; the Honda had only temp/fuel.

 

Now the CRX SI I picked up is more stripped down than either of those two - manual mirrors, manual steering, and the radio was optional I believe - this one has an aftermarket Pioneer tape, and there is a faceplate in the glovebox that says 'Honda' on it, which I think came from the same spot.

 

All three models had really great seats, but I would give the nod just barely to the ones in the Toyota - better bolstering."
2269	February 3, 2005 1:40PM	driftracer	"and that car was put through hell - I delivered pizza in it, and autocrossed it no less than 100 times in the 5 years I owned it.

 

It's amazing, the complete and total 180 degree difference between what was available in the aftermarket for imports then, versus what's there now - I would have been completely broke and borrowed to detriment if half the things available now were available then."
2270	February 3, 2005 3:36PM	michaellno	"I've got a HS buddy who is currently driving an '84 CRX -- not the Si model, the carburated version. Gotta have at least 200K on it, he's had it for 6-7 years I think.

 

I came this close to buying a '91 Civic Si .. it was that or a '91 Sentra SE. When the Honda salesman told me that the Si was classified as a sports car for insurance purposes, that sealed the deal and I bought the Nissan.

 

Yeah, Hondas back then came pretty stripped .. often, no right hand mirror, no radio, no AC. But, the dealers sold every one they could get their hands on, often for more than sticker.

 

FX-16 -- what I rememeber about these was that they were one of the first cars to come with a 16-valve engine, which was pretty high tech for the time.

 

jolie, I will never come close to the miles you put on Zippy. We've had our Focus just over 14 months and it has just under 21K miles. Of course, my round trip commute is less than half of yours (65-70 miles), so that explains a lot."
2271	February 3, 2005 3:42PM	andre1969	"used to have a CRX. I don't remember much about it, except that it was a '91, and it was a stick shift. I don't know how many miles they racked up on it, but it was a good little car for them. The only problem I can really remember with it was a piece of trim on the driver's side rocker panel that popped loose a few times.

 

They have an Accord sedan now, so evidently that CRX was good enough to keep them in the Honda fold."
2272	February 4, 2005 12:32AM	gee35coupe	"But it did have the MR2 engine with the dual stage manifolds. They called the system T-VIS. The seats in the top models were multi-adjustable. Height, lumbar, headrest. They came out of the Celica/Supra. And mine had power roof, windows, and mirrors. It was a sweet ride. No hard palstic anywhere. Either soft touch plastic or velour. They don't make cars like that any more.

 

The regular FX16's were just FX's with the go-fast package. Engine, brakes, suspension."

2279	February 4, 2005 3:29PM	kyfdx	TSX... you know you want it...
2280	February 4, 2005 3:33PM	anonymousposts	TSX is out of sight, out of mind. I absolutely LOOOOOOVE the way the TSX looks and the interior is an improvement over my Accord. However, my Accord has it's selling points ... okay it has one selling point and that's the price at the end of the lease vs. buying a new TSX. If my Accord holds up and doesn't get hit again I'm not sure if I can justify the additional $15,000 that the TSX would require. A set of wheels, springs, a TL sway bar, and a cold-air intake for my Accord would be much cheaper.
2281	February 4, 2005 3:45PM	robr2	I read today that Honda is readying a 240HP turbo 2.4L I4 to drop into either the TSX or a new Civic Si.
2282	February 4, 2005 3:49PM	kyfdx	"You know why you won't buy the Accord for $12K at the end of the lease?

 

Because that is $300/mo. for 4 years, and you can lease a brand new one for that...

 

That is how I ended up leasing Accords for three consecutive times.."
2283	February 4, 2005 4:00PM	anonymousposts	"True, but at the end of the 3 years my 04 Accord would be paid for.

but recently (past 7 years)been buying a lot more:

 

 I dropped off my Previa at the dealership for service...I was driving a Enterprise Renta Car, and baby sitting my 3 year old son and 3 yr old god daughter. I am in shorts and T shirt and bring the 2 kids into Jaguar dealership...they thouught I was nuts...but I ended up driving out with a Jaguar XJ12 , on a whim, and had the dealership return my rental car...

 

bought a 2000 boxster S , for the wife...as she wanted a convertible....

 

now with 3 cars...I saw an ad for a Stillen Suburban...so I flew down to LA at 3 pm....met the guy at Stillen motorsports....and bought the souped up suburban, and drove it back 6 hours home. Got home at 1 am .....

 

then liked the cayenne so much...with all its capabilities...that went out during the release month and bought one.....sold the Jag , boxster, and previa...

 

then bought a Acura TL with a -spec package...

 

don;t know whats happening this year....may get a sports car or prius.... ???"
2290	February 6, 2005 7:49AM	jjtj	That was really one great car.. I was in HS at the time when my friends' older brother bought one new.. an 86. That car begged to be redlined.. he used to let us drive it all the time. We took it on a few road trips and it was extremely hard to drive at the speed limit. It was actually fun getting in traffic as when you'd find an opening it was a blast winding it out in 2nd & 3rd gear. It was just so above most other cars back then.. interior was comfortable & the whole car just had the best feel to it. He traded it on an 88 Prelude SI with 4WS.. nice car but nowhere near the personality of the Civic SI. Thanks for the trip down memory lane!

Yes...my tastes do vary....

 

I like 928s, boxster was wife's idea...

 

like VW, especially the scirocco...but they stink in terms of performance, compared to Honda preludes or any other at that time (1985)

 

TL was wifes' idea...I like it also....but kinda wanted the mercedes 300 or BMW 330i....but like the TL also.

 

just put in a bid for a 1993 Porsche 928 GTS, but did not want to get into a bidding war and overpay....

Or, at least tell me a fair ballpark price to pay? Now for one thing, this car has been sitting on their lot for about a year now, as the pic shows trees with no leaves on it, but I first noticed this car back in late Sept/early Oct, when everything was still nice and green, so the pic must've been taken last winter, not this winter.

 

So evidently, they want too much for it. I was thinking about offering $2500-3000, presumin it would pass inspection. Does that seem fair, or too low? It's actually a fairly basic SS, with crank windows. I've always wanted one of these, though! And it's only about a mile away from me!"

I'd offer $2500...they probably have $3,000-3,500 in it, may let it go for $3,500-4,000...who knows?

 

Based on my experience of some of these back home in Texas, it's a $3500-4000 retail car - of course, it's winter time, and you're in MD.

Andre: One of my roommates while in the Marines, had an 86 Monte SS. Had a large journal(4 bolt main, versus 2, IIRC) 355, in front of a 700R4. Had a manual valve body, made it real easy to shift it manually. Would hold the gear until you bumped it up. Had a Holley 750 double pumper. Was dynoed at 375hp, on the ground, which really worked the LSD. Car was lowered 1 inch, and had full exhuast, headers on down, to 3 inch tail pipes.

 

He had punched the cats(car was registered in MS) and it sounded great.

 

One of his cousins was a double major at UNC, Electrical and Acoustical engineering. This kid designed a sound system to work with the acoustics of the Monte SS.

 

We had too much fun in that car. Had 3.55 rearend gears, so would easily run to 160, didn't trust himself to go any faster. He could make that Monte drift, as if on ice. Those back roads of Eastern N.C. were great.

 

He ended up turning car in to a quartermiler.

 

As you can see, I too have a warm spot in my heart for the mid-80s Monte SS. Nevermind the fact that the first auto incident I was in, after getting my DL, involve a beautiful black cherry Monte SS.

 

 Was my fault, but other guy didn't want any ins. involvment or nothing. Just said go away. He must have been hiding something.

 

I've gone on long enough, next."

Deathtrap is not really accurate. They are not meant to drive in a high speed environment and were not designed to share the roads with large trucks and SUVs."

2301	February 8, 2005 4:32AM	akangl	"Does it count as a purchase if we are spending someone else's money?? My mom has asked me to find her a cheap little car to drive until the Subaru is back (at least 2 months), plus she wants a second car anyway.

 

What do you think of this?? I used all my pull to get the price down and can't get it any lower.

 

1996 Mazda Protege DX, 64k miles (yes that's 64,000 miles), 5-speed, am/fm/cd, white/grey, good shape for its age, a couple small scuffs on the bumpers, but other than that its nice.

 

Dealer was asking $3995, will do $3200 but no lower. He (owner of the car lot) said he just got it a couple days ago and had it shipped from Anchorage ($300). Its a repo, no bad history other than that."
2302	February 8, 2005 12:52PM	corvette	"Protege, successor to the 323 which succeeded the GLC (Great Little Car). I haven't driven one of that vintage, but the 1999-2003 (not sure about the years) model was on par with a Civic/Corolla. Great thing about Mazdas is that they have most if not all of the great attributes of a Honda or Toyota, except the resale value is lower. (I think that about Nissans as well, but understand if you don't agree.)

 

Does her car insurance pay for diminished value? Make it clear to them that you will be pursuing a claim for that as well if they don't total the car. (In the words of one of my friends, there's a difference between can't and won't.)"

This week its an 03 Ford Escape.

 

The front axle came out of the differential this morning, good thing we noticed the fluid all over, and made it to the dealer. Also a good thing we checked it over before our trip tomorrow to Anchorage towing our popup camper."
2306	February 10, 2005 1:41AM	nippononly	"came out of the diff? That's some seriously cheeseball stuff for an established car company like Nissan. I am leaning away from recommending Nissan to anyone who's asking right now. It is not so much isolated incidents like this, but rather a much broader sense of massive inconsistency going on among their product right now.

 

On a related note, I was perusing the Auto Trader today and checked the Nissan section just for a look-see. I swear well over half the cars in there from 2003 on up were 350Zs, many of them with under 10K miles on them as they got more recent. What's up with that?"
2307	February 10, 2005 1:47AM	akangl	It was partially out when they put it on the lift, the guy grabbed hold of it to see if that was the problem and it came out the rest of the way. Apparently its a design flaw in some of the Titans, the retainer clip inside the diff breaks and allows the axle to free float until it tears up enough stuff to break free. I, for one, will not buy Nissan again........well, maybe a Max or a Murano, those seem to do ok.
2308	February 10, 2005 2:03AM	nippononly	is so old-school at this point, it is probably about the only one I would recommend - tried and true, ya know?

Are the rear-ends a common trouble spot for the Titan and Armada?"
2311	February 10, 2005 7:42PM	gee35coupe	In the Edmunds Titan forum. That's a shame too cause it's the best lookin' truck on the market.

Besides the small ring gear diameter and pumpkin, the ring and pinion teeth are stressed by the tall final drive ratio, which makes for less surface area to transfer torque.
2314	February 11, 2005 3:30AM	gee35coupe	I went Titan shopping and found you have to get a near fully loaded one to get the sunroof. Not gonna make a big deal about it, I'll pass.

The new Pathy, Frontier, and XTerra are built in the Smyrna, TN plant. That plant has been around a long time - my '93 Sentra SE-R was built there - and has a very good rep for quality. I have high hopes for the smaller (but still pretty big) Nissan trucks. The Frontier in particular is a looker - I think it wears that style even better than the Titan. If they come out with a long bed crew cab I'd be all over that.

2316	February 11, 2005 9:54PM	akangl	"A few observations.......Ford makes an awesome little SUV. That Escape is one of the best I've driven. I'm going to hate to give it back.

 

If we can get Nissan to buy that cursed Titan back (fat chance), we will probably go in search of a Ford Escape. I really like it, so does hubby, that's the first vehicle we've ever driven to Anchorage that hubby hasn't been uncomfortable in.

 

I'm going to have a hard time trusting that Titan again, had I not noticed the fluid it would have been a BAD deal. Was just a fluke that I noticed it, only because I forgot something in the house.

 

Ah well, for the next 2 weeks at least I'll have the Escape and won't have to worry.

 

On another note, got the estimate on my mom's car today..........$7050. Not totalled, they are going to fix it......I disagree, but oh well."

I told Mom I would buy it back from her in a heartbeat when she's done with it.......her reply......don't bank on it! *Tarter Sauce!!*

 

I should have NEVER sold that car. It has 3 things wrong with it, the automatic seatbelts don't work.....$72 to fix, it needs front brakes and rotors.....$110, and it needs a new ignition and door locks.......$130. Not too bad for a 11 year old car with 109k on it.

I respectfully disagree. If I had an M5 to drive every day, I'd never get bored. I'd get tired of the speeding tickets, and later, tired of the repair bills, but never bored."
2347	February 17, 2005 12:07AM	andre1969	"for the time period, the Miradas and Cordobas were pretty luxurious compared to their peers. And, dare I say, sporty? Here's an old ad for one:

 

http://www.yanktanks.co.uk/pcfiles/ads80s/dodgemirada80.jpg

 

Back around 1980-83, I don't think you could even get leather on a Monte Carlo or Grand Prix. Maybe on a Regal or Cutlass, but it would've been very rare. Might've been somewhat common on a T-bird or Cougar around that time, though. It seems to be pretty common on Cordobas and Miradas, though.

 

Miradas and Cordobas also came with a sporty looking instrument display which, oddly, was lifted from the full-sized R-bodies. And bucket seats with a floor shift were also pretty common, trying to make you think you were in a musclecar. And sadly, in 1980 the Cordoba/Mirada was about the closest you'd get to that, as they could be had with a 180 hp copcar 360-4bbl. Laughable today, but compare that to the 301's, 305's, 307's and 302's that were going in the competition at the time!

 

15"" alloy wheels were also fairly common on these cars, whereas your typical GM or Ford competition was just running 14"" steel rims with hubcaps or <shudder> wire wheels!

 

If these cars had been introduced at any time other than recession-ridden 1980, they probably would've sold well. They got a lot of good press from the buff rags of the time. Unfortunately, they were just too BIG for 1980! Even though they were downsized from the '75-79 Cordoba and lost a good 500 lb or more, they were still big and heavy. This car competed, with Monte Carlos and T-birds in 1980, but was about as long as a Caprice or Crown Vic!

 

I want one, though! Dangit Fintail, why'd you show me that eBay Mirada?! ;-)"
2348	February 17, 2005 1:15AM	robr2	Back in the early to mid 80's, the Cutlass was the best selling car in America. IIRC, few cars really had leather - velour was the luxury touch then. A white Cutlass with a burgundy velour interior, a burgandy landau roof, and wire hubcaps was we aspired too!!
2349	February 17, 2005 8:31AM	highender	"And, lets get a '99 Daewoo.. for robr2..

 

LOL...you are being generous ? no 1986 Yugo ?

 

:-)"
2350	February 17, 2005 8:38AM	highender	":-)

 

 I guess I am really out for adventure and change.....

 

I got bored with the Boxster S....and the 928...though I do miss them now....

 

OK...it is fun to drive the cayenne...and sometimes even the suburban....

 

but I think a stable for all of us would be nice.....kinda cordially and nicely share the stallions.....or sign up for them.....have a rotation sheet....

 

OK...you got dibs on the M5....the new one with the V10 and 500 horses... :-)"
2351	February 17, 2005 1:21PM	andre1969	"I had an '82 Cutlass Supreme. Jadestone with a matching interior and landau top. I lucked out though, and got one with the color-keyed rally wheels, instead of wire wheel or regular hubcaps. Mine was just a base model though, and had a cloth interior that had a corduroy look to it, but was softer. I used to work with a guy that had an '84 or '85 Cutlass Supreme, that WAS white with a burgundy landau roof and wire hubcaps! His also had leather.

 

I think Chrysler was probably a pioneer, among the domestics, at least, in bringing leather seating to lower-priced cars. You could get leather in a '75 Cordoba, rrrrich Corrrrinthian leather, at that! Now in 75 the Cordoba was in kind of a unique position as it was priced below the likes of the T-bird, Mark IV, Eldorado/Toro/Riv, but still above the Monte Carlo, Grand Prix, Cutlass Supreme, and Regal. It was a start, though, and in later years either the Cordoba moved downscale, or the other cars caught up to it in price.

 

Leather was also very common in the big '74-78 New Yorkers. In contrast though, I think it was still very rare in the Electras and Ninety-eights of the time.

 

I've even seen late 70's Diplomats and LeBarons with leather, which really surprised me. I don't think you'd find leather as an option in any Ford or GM equivalent of the time.

 

It's funny though, how in some cars, leather would be the top choice, while in others it would be velour. A friend of mine has a Mark V Diamond Jubilee, and on that car leather was actually a credit option! Top billing was a cloth that seemed to be kind of a cross between velour and felt. But then on my '79 New Yorker, leather was an option, or if you spent another $1500 for the 5th Avenue Edition, you got a different leather interior.

 

Another thing that I find odd is that, in the 70's, sometimes cloth was actually the standard material, and vinyl was an extra-cost option! I always thought that was backwards, because to me vinyl was always the bottom of the barrel. Although I guess you could have a really cheap cloth and a really nice vinyl?"
2352	February 17, 2005 3:40PM	robr2	"Although I guess you could have a really cheap cloth and a really nice vinyl?

The really nice vinyl is naugahyde - very popular in the 70's. But then the environmentalists started complaining about all the poor naugas that had to die...

Thank you, thank you very much. I'll be here till Sunday - try the veal."
2353	February 17, 2005 3:51PM	andre1969	"all of those Morros that had to be sacrificed to make those Pontiac ""Morrokide"" interiors! ;-)

Some of that vinyl could actually be nice enough to fool you. I had a '69 Bonneville with a vinyl interior, and at a quick glance it was nice enough, and thick enough, to fool you into thinking it was leather. It was a horrible goldish-green color, though."
2354	February 17, 2005 4:05PM	robr2	"I had a 72 Olds Cutlass S. Gulf Green Metallic with a black vinyl roof and dark green vinyl interior.

I've never been able to figure out the differnce between the Cutlass S and the Cutlass Supreme."
2355	February 18, 2005 2:54AM	racer63	"If I remember correctly, the Cutlass S was the base model and the Supreme was top of the line. the plain Cutlass was the middle trim.

All this color talk reminds me of the family '72 Chevy Vega, that was bought new, and lasted until I learned to drive in it, circa 1980. The carpet was tow pieces, with a seam just behind the front buckets. The UAW at Lordstown managed to install two different colors, black in front like it was supposed to be, and green in the rear, which wasn't really obvious until long out of warranty when it started to fade. That was the least of that car's problems though."
2356	February 18, 2005 2:55AM	ghulet	....in '72, the differences between the two were that the Supreme had a four-barrel 350 (180hp, as opposed to the 160 horse two-barrel in the 'S'), a special die cast eggcrate grille, fake wood interior trim and strato-bucket seats (which was a bench with a big folding armrest in the middle, which when down made the seat look like buckets). Woo-hoo.
2357	February 18, 2005 1:24PM	andre1969	didn't the Cutlass Supreme have more of a notchback roofline, while the other models were more of a fastback? I don't think they followed that convention for all of '68-72, but I thought they did for at least part of it.
2358	February 18, 2005 4:13PM	robr2	"Well since it was my Dad who originally bought the Cutlass S, it was probably a base model.

It had a grille with horizontal bars while the Supreme model had the eggcrate. There were also differences with the rear quarters. The S had a rounded arch - fastback and then there were models with a squared off arch - more upright."
2359	February 18, 2005 4:24PM	andre1969	"with some nice pics of a '72 Cutlass S:
http://www.musclecarcalendar.com/CarShows2004/WoodlyParkGM/WPGMp5- .htm

And here's a '72 Supreme, for comparison:
http://www.oldsclub.ca/images/gallery/waite.jpg

I like 'em both, but think I actually prefer the Supreme's more formal roofline, but then the S's less pretentious grille!

Even by '82, they were still making subtle differences in Cutlass grilles. My '82 Cutlass had a vertical grille, but the Brougham model had more of an eggcrate pattern. I broke one of my grille sections, and the only other Cutlass I could find in the junkyard with both sections undamaged was an '82 Brougham, so I snagged 'em both so it would at least match up.

I guess there's something to be said for the modern way of doing things, where they don't change the grille and other trim pieces for years and years!"
2360	February 18, 2005 4:31PM	robr2	Yep - that be it but my S had the body side mouldings and hub cups oh and only the LH mirror. Even the grille was different. Mine had horizontal bars. But when I had to replace them, I could only get the Supreme eggcrates.

2362	February 18, 2005 5:02PM	akangl	They did't cut me any slack for buying my old car back. Heck, it even threatened my CCBA status.
2363	February 18, 2005 5:04PM	andre1969	without a car payment, and I think I'm starting to go through withdrawal!
2364	February 18, 2005 5:07PM	akangl	I took care of my urge by paying cash for that Escort, course Mom paid me right back, but still it was fun. Should hold me for a while me thinks.
2365	February 18, 2005 5:13PM	qbrozen	"I don't think that will help at all. Unless you count a couple of weeks as ""a while."""
2366	February 18, 2005 6:33PM	akangl	Hey, I've had the Focus for just shy of 7 months, still love that car. The Titan is just over 3 months and its still like a new car to me since I never get to drive it. We've had the Dodge for 15 months.
2367	February 18, 2005 7:38PM	michaellno	"We've had the VUE for almost 3 months, the Focus for 15, and the L300 for 27 months.

Am toying with the idea of trading in the Focus for a used ION or L-series for the daughter to drive so I can get my L300 back. Right now, I'm in the Focus as it's a stick and the girl hasn't mastered 3 pedal driving just yet.

OTOH, I really like the fact that the L300 isn't getting many miles put on it .. maybe 10 a day at most, versus my 70 mile r/t commute to Denver.

Thoughts? The Focus has 36 payments left, and I really don't want to increase the payment size or length, just swap over to a safe, reliable car with an auto tranny for the kid."
2368	February 18, 2005 10:21PM	andre1969	"While I've only had it about 29 months (acquired in late Sept '02), my '85 Silverado will be in the family for 20 YEARS this summer, around July, I believe. Granddad bought it new back in '85, and after he passed away in '90, Grandmom held onto it. She'd drive it occasionally, and sometimes I'd drive it to college, as I was living with her at the time. My uncle would drive it on occasion as well.

My grandmother would've given it to my uncle, but he decided he wanted a new, but base level truck with no frills. He works in construction and tends to throw a lot of tools and junk into the cab, so he'd have the cloth door panels and carpeting on the Silverado torn up pretty quickly. So he bought a stripper GMC Sierra in '94. Somewhere around '94-96 or so, Grandmom gave it to my Mom & stepdad. Then, they bought a new '03 F-150 in late '02, and didn't need it anymore, so it got passed down to me.

I know it can get pretty boring keeping the same vehicle around for 20 years, but I guess there really is something to be said for it, cost-wise. Granddad paid about $13,500 for it, out-the-door, back in '85. I know it didn't need more than a few hundred bucks worth of repairs while Grandmom & Granddad had it, but by the time my Mom & stepdad had it, they probably put up to $2K into it. And in the 29 months I've had it, I've replaced the belts, distributor, had something minor done to the tranny (forget what, but with the servicing, it only came out to around $130...it was something that was making it suck tranny fluid into the vacuum lines, and into the carb), and a new battery. Oh, and a power window switch.

But then again, this truck has pretty much been a spare vehicle since 1990 when Granddad died, so if it was a primary, I'm sure it would have a lot more miles on it by now, and probably had a few more repairs!

The longest car I've had, personally, is my '57 DeSoto, which I bought in September 1990. I wonder what the record is for longest ownership of a car?"
2369	February 19, 2005 2:15PM	kyfdx	"Wooooo-Hooooo....

Just got my tickets for Reds Opening Day...

On topic.. I'll be going in my CAR"
2370	February 19, 2005 3:10PM	anonymousposts	"I want to buy SOMETHING, I just don't know what that something is. I love my Accord but can't help but think that I would love a 6-speed TL just as much. Gee is still in love with his Si for the most part but he wants a TL/TSX too.

Our lease is up in another 2 years and 3 months so we have time to plan. In the mean time I am trying to push others to buy cars so I get my CCB fix. Is that wrong?"
2371	February 19, 2005 5:42PM	kyfdx	"I'm going to the Cincinnati auto show today.. I'm not really in the market for anything, but since I'm not currently leasing either of our cars, anything can happen..

I'm the same way... since I'm not buying, I try to encourage others.. My uncle has traded both of his cars in the last six months, and I had plenty of advice for him..

If it's wrong, I don't want to be right... lol"
2372	February 19, 2005 5:42PM	akangl	"lol, nope, I do the same thing.

Although right now I'm driving a 2003 Escape, so when I get my Titan back it will be like getting a new truck all over again, seems to keep the CCB at bay. Heck, I hardly get to drive it, its almost 4 months old with only 4800 miles on it. Zippy will be 7 months old in 2 days and has nearly 24k on her.

However, I did buy that 94 Escort the other day for my mom........so I guess that counts too."
2373	February 20, 2005 12:08AM	racer63	"The Celica will have been around 5 years and 82k in a week. It is still fun to drive and cheap to keep running, but even the Mrs. is saying it is starting to feel old. She has had to drive it the past couple of weeks as her mother had a quad bypass, and the Toyoter is way easier to park att he hospital than the crew cab GMC 2500HD, which BTW has only been around 7 months.

Problem is, nothing is saying by me enough to make me want to suck it up to make the payment."
2374	February 20, 2005 7:11PM	corvette	You could look for a 5-speed L-series for yourself, but I don't think they came very well optioned.
2375	February 22, 2005 4:11PM	michaellno	"Nah, I miss my V6, the heated leather seats, the sunroof, etc.

A local dealer is offering '04 Olds Aleros for something like $9600 .. I checked the website and they all have between 12K and 30K miles on them. Reasonably equipped, both 2 and 4 doors, auto tranny, 2.2L Ecotec engines. I'm seriously considering one for the kid."
2376	February 22, 2005 4:30PM	stickguy	"hard to go wrong for a 1 year old car for LT 10K nicely equipped, with an extended warranty (don't the Olds' have extra protection)?

Drive it for years and put next to nothing into it, and not lose too much when you resell (not much to lose at that purchase price).

of course, you have to drive a 4 cyl Alero, so there is a downside, but being frugal isn't always pleasant."
2377	February 22, 2005 4:56PM	andre1969	how the newer 4-cyl Ecotech Alero would perform? I had a '99 Alero 4-cyl as a rental awhile back, and that sucker would really kick. However, it had the older 2.4 (?) Quad-4, which had something like 150 hp. It was definitely a fun little car.
2378	February 22, 2005 6:26PM	jlawrence01	"15 Yards for excessive gloating ....

BTW, how long did you wait in line??"
2379	February 22, 2005 6:26PM	michaellno	"The Alero would be for the daughter; I would get my '03 L300 back.

I think the 2.2L has 140 HP. Don't know about the warranty -- I would guess the bulk of the factory warranty would still be available. Yeah, I do seem to remember that for the last couple of model years, GM offered 5/60 warranties on Oldsmobile products.

Guess a call to the dealer might be in order.

The big problem would be the trade in value of the '03 Focus; I'm pretty sure I'm upside down, but don't know how much."
2380	February 22, 2005 6:29PM	kyfdx	"2 minutes in front of my computer with DSL connection... They sold out in 12 minutes this year...

Last year with dial-up, I didn't have a chance.. had to buy from a scalper.."
2381	February 22, 2005 6:37PM	danf1	The extra warranty that GM gave was actually their extended GMPP which probably would not transfer. I'm not 100% sure, but you definitely want to check into that before letting it sway your decision.
2382	February 22, 2005 8:30PM	volvodan1	It doesn't transfer. You'll get the remainder of the 3yr/36K mile warranty. If it's for the kid, the 2.2 is nice. I know I have 04 V6 GL's for 10,9xx range. They have 3.4's. Check around you may find some.
2383	February 22, 2005 8:43PM	michaellno	"This dealer (who sells Pontiacs and GMCs new), has 783 2004 Aleros in stock, according to their website.

They are always running ads promoting 2004 model year GM cars for 1/2 MSRP (Aleros for $9981, Malibus for $8981, Impalas for $11,775, Sedan De Villes for $23,755).

Equipment on a sample Alero includes:

A/C
Power windows
Cruise
AM/FM CD player
Tilt Steering Wheel

No mention of keyless remote, power locks or ABS, all of which I would want my daughter to have."
2384	February 22, 2005 9:43PM	volvodan1	783............as in SEVEN-HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE? WOW!! They should have those options. All of ours do. The rentals all have those options.
2385	February 22, 2005 9:56PM	michaellno	"They had over 800 last week when I first checked.

This place just loves to pick up former rentals, program cars and anything else they can get their hands on - usually, all of the same model.

For a while, they were running ads on the ""unloved"" Pontiac Aztek, and what a screaming deal they were. Now, they are focusing on the Alero.

In addition to the pricing ad, they also have a 1/4 page ""article"" on the featured car ... it's written to look like an in-depth article on the car, it's features, history and what not. Most definitely not a typical car dealer ad."
2386	February 23, 2005 8:13PM	michaellno	"So, I called the Alero superstore last night on my way home from work. Here is what I found out:

--> All cars come with the remainder of the factory GM warranty (3/36). An extended warranty can be purchased; the price is on a sliding scale based on the mileage of the car bought. An example was a car with 24K miles - the extended warranty would be $695 (no mention of how long this extended things).

--> No ABS

--> Keyless remote and power locks are standard, as are alloy wheels and the rear spoiler.

--> Price of $9981 is pretty firm; not much wiggle room available, at least according to the guy I spoke with.

Bottom line: Lack of ABS is a deal breaker, as I want my daughter to have that feature on any car she drives, especially with the kind of weather we get in CO (snow and ice in the winter, afternoon t-storms in the summer)."
2387	February 23, 2005 10:27PM	jasmith52	"I'll bet that the Alero dealer has some other late model cars at great prices with ABS. Ask them about it.

I'll also bet that those Alero's are rental cars coming out of a rental fleet. Nothing wrong with a used rental car - They can be great values."
2388	February 23, 2005 11:53PM	jlawrence01	Out of curiosity, which dealership is offering all of these Aleros?
2389	February 23, 2005 11:55PM	jlawrence01	"**I'll also bet that those Alero's are rental cars coming out of a rental fleet. Nothing wrong with a used rental car - They can be great values. **

Another possibility is that the vehicles come from a corporate fleet. It is nothing for a company to dump 50-100 vehicles used by their salesman/repairmen/ etc. on a dealership group in a remarketing agreement."
2390	February 24, 2005 12:11AM	corvette	I wouldn't buy a car without it either. How did they manage to buy 800 at auction and have every single one of them equipped the same?
2391	February 24, 2005 2:43AM	racer63	Fell off the wagon tonight and rolled into the local Mazda dealer on the way home, who has not 1, but 2 rather intriguing leftover RX-8's, both relatively stripped, and therefore also relatively cheap too. Ball park price offered was invoice -4k in rebates, putting the price for either in the low 22's, even before negotiating. Lotta bling in RX-8's for the buck. Problem is, I came home and Mrs. Racer63 sez no. What can I do to convince her?
2392	February 24, 2005 3:53AM	steine13	"You [foolish person].

Ya don't ASK.

What you do is, you get the car, and then you ask the wife for forgiveness.

Sheesh.

[A different car every 8 months, same woman since '88. Everybody's got problems.]"
2393	February 24, 2005 3:11PM	anonymousposts	"I'm with Mathias on this one. Or you could do like Gee does and ask if you can buy it and then go out and do what you want to do anyways. Or you could get a new wife. Although that would make for a very expensive RX-8 so maybe you oughta go for option one or two.

Another option is to start looking at more expensive cars and then maybe Mrs. Racer will see the value in the RX-8."
2394	February 24, 2005 3:31PM	kyfdx	"Did you get them to work up a lease payment? It might be super-cheap.. then again, maybe not..

BTW, Mathias' wife left him in '97.. He just hasn't noticed yet.."
2395	February 24, 2005 3:33PM	michaellno	"The dealership is Suss Pontiac/GMC in Aurora, CO.

Not exactly sure why, but this dealership is always advertising late model GM cars. As mentioined earlier, they had a run of Pontiac Azteks on the lot. Before that, it was Buick Century Customs.

Where they come from, I do not know.

No way I'm going to get in the middle of the RX-8 debate."
2396	February 24, 2005 3:49PM	corvette	$22k? American pesos? That's a bargain. I don't think there are any subsidized leases, but with all those rebates, the payment might still be cheap.
2397	February 24, 2005 4:21PM	gee35coupe	Where's that RX8? It may be time to get rid of the Lexus and the Civic.
2398	February 24, 2005 4:29PM	kyfdx	4-doors... perfect for a baby..
2399	February 24, 2005 4:38PM	stickguy	You can fit in an RX-8? I'm 6', and am up against the ceiling.
2400	February 24, 2005 5:51PM	gee35coupe	But my height is in my legs. I've never had a problem with head room. There have been a few cars that I could not fit behind the wheel though. The current Corolla for example.
2401	February 24, 2005 6:03PM	andre1969	"legroom. I'm 6'3"", but a good deal of it is in my legs. Headroom usually isn't a problem for me, although sometimes the low windshield top on many new cars will bother me. With all the old cars I've driven over the years, I just got used to looking dead-on at the rear view mirror, or even up at it, instead of down at it.

My uncle has an '03 Corolla, and I've driven it a few times. I don't like to, though. The only small cars that I like, legroom-wise, are the Neon, the Mazda3, and the Chevy Cobalt. They're all fine for me up front, and the Neon is actually roomy enough that, with the front seat adjusted to where I like it, I can even fit in the back! There aren't too many small, or even mid-sized cars that can boast that!"
2402	February 24, 2005 6:11PM	gee35coupe	The hatch is a perfect fit though. My leg gets stuck between the wheel and center console.
2403	February 24, 2005 6:20PM	kyfdx	That's okay... the hatch is much cooler...
2404	February 24, 2005 6:53PM	stickguy	"that doesn't make sense. I thought they were identical from the front seats forward? Why would the drivers seat be any different?

My height is more in the torso. THe only car I really had leg room issues with was my Miata, but I have head room problems in a number of cars."
2405	February 24, 2005 8:51PM	gee35coupe	But when I sat in the hatch, I fit. But I didn't fit in the sedan. The salesperson was stumped too.
2406	February 25, 2005 1:40AM	jlawrence01	"I have been wanting to drive one so I keep ordering a compact from Avis ... and what do they do? They keep upgrading me to ""nice"" vehicles. This weekend's chariot was a 2005 Pontiac Vibe. I have to admit that I was impressed with the 32 mpg gas mileage that I received while tooling around N. Alabama."
2407	February 25, 2005 2:44AM	racer63	"Yep everyone.....22k George Washington Dugans. One has only the Appearance Package, the other just the Sport Package. Original MSRP for either is mid $28's. One has been advertised in the mid 20's, deducting the graduation/conquest/cousin's neighbor's ex-brother-in-law rebates beyond my ""what's your best price"" question. I was at the dealer such a short time, I didn't even sit down.

A lease would probably not net a low monthly as $2.5k of the price cut is a Mazda Credit you-have-to-take-our-loan rebate, if you buy their full-boat financing. So any deal would using that would need some kind of re-fi or payoff.

I fit in the car fine as long as it does not have a sunroof. I'm 6' even, but kind of thick with stumpy 32"" inseam legs, so I end up sitting kind of high in a seat.

The Mrs. might be an easier sell than my kids, who think it is U-G-L-Y. That and common sense entering in of the wisdom of adding another car payment on top of my just refi-ed increased mortgage (y'all don't want to know how much) and the $663 whopper monthly to GMAC for the new in July '04 truck. I also was allowed to recently order a fancy enclosed $10k+ race trailer, so it isn't like I'm being deprived. Like any other spoiled man-child I just want another toy."
2408	February 25, 2005 2:51PM	anonymousposts	"The bad thing about two car nuts is that any time he says he wants something I say ""go for it, you just have to sell the Lexus and your Civic"". That's kept him out of trouble for the last 18 months.

As for the Mazda3, Mazda lists identical leg room measurements for the hatch and the sedan. The hatch is actually 2"" shorter than the sedan. Weird."
2409	February 25, 2005 2:59PM	andre1969	"can be a funny thing, and sometimes I don't understand how they get their measurements. For example, my Intrepid is 42.2"", while a Chrysler 300/Dodge Magnum is only 41.8"". Now if I barely fit in the Intrepid, you'd think the Magnum/300 would be a torture chamber for me, but they actually feel roomier to me! But then, the Toyota Camry, at 41.7"", feels tight.

As for the Mazda3, I think the hatch uses different sheetmetal for the rear quarter panels, so they probably do enough restructuring of it in general the results in overall reduced length. The old Mazda Protege and Protege5 sportwagon were the same way, with the 5 being a few inches shorter, aft of the rear wheels."
2410	February 25, 2005 4:00PM	lemmer	"I have never been able to figure out these measurements.

For example, I can sit in my Pathfinder and my kids fit behind me just fine. When I borrowed an RX-8 for about a month, I had to leave the passenger seat fully forward and upright to just barely fit a rear facing child seat behind it. I couldn't sit comfortably up front without my four year old squealing that I was smushing her feet.But, according to the measurements the RX-8 has .9"" more legroom in front and .4"" in back.

I still have been trying to convince my wife that the RX-8 would make a good family car. The harder sale is to my four year old daughter who absolutely hates it. She says she has no foot room, she sits way too low, and the windows are too small.

She also says the coolest thing on four wheels is mom's minivan, so what does she know."
2411	February 25, 2005 4:08PM	andre1969	"concerning front legroom, is that they measure it from the base of the accelerator pedal to the backrest of the front seat. At least I think that's how they measure it.

So whatever measurement they take gives no indication as to how much room gets taken out by an overly-intrusive dead pedal, a dashboard that's too low, how far away the firewall/cowl is, how much space the tranny'driveshaft hump might rob, etc.

And when you measure a car with power seats, there are so many different adjustments you can make to change legroom, and to me that makes it even more confusing. For example, I think my grandmother's '85 LeSabre was rated at 42.0 or 42.2 inches, but I could actually adjust that seat so far up and back that I had to stretch to reach the pedals!"
2412	March 1, 2005 12:10AM	trucker50	since this is supposed to be about chronic car buyers I was wondering....whats the shortest time one has went after buying a car before he bought another one? I'm getting the itch and my Grand Prix is just 3 months old er almost
2413	March 1, 2005 12:11AM	driftracer	pair of vehicles....1 week, one time in 1998.
2414	March 1, 2005 12:32AM	akangl	hmmmm, I think 14 days back in 1997, we bought a new 97 Impreza and 14 days later bought a used 1992 F-250.
2415	March 1, 2005 1:07PM	bryan	One week apart--04 Alero May 15 and 04 Bonny GXP May 22.
2416	March 1, 2005 1:54PM	andre1969	"I had a car was from around June-November 1999. That June, a friend gave me a '67 Newport 2-door hardtop. It had been his grandmother's, and when she passed away the family just wanted it gone. Her house had really fallen into disrepair, and having this beast sitting in the driveway didn't exactly add to its value! The house had sat vacant for so long, and the car just sitting there, vulnerable, that it got a few things taken off of it. The 60's were a more innocent time, and a locking hood was truly a rare thing. Someone had stolen the battery from under the hood. They also stole 4 of the 8 spark plug wires.

After we put a battery and new wires on it, it ran fine. The 383-2, tranny, and rear-end felt just as strong as when they rolled off the assembly line, and the a/c still blew cold! The body was getting pretty rusty, though.

I put historic tags on this car, and really didn't drive it much. Mainly it just sat. Then the brakes went out on it. That November, I bought my Intrepid. I didn't have any money on me and my checking account was just about dry, so my uncle wrote me the $2000 check for the down payment. Well, I already owed him $2000, and felt really guilty, so I decided to sell the Newport for whatever I could get for it, and then start paying him back.

So late one night when traffic was light, I drove the car the 9 miles over to my grandmother's, where it could sit in the yard instead of off the street (and could be hidden if it took too long to get rid of), and dropped the tags and insurance.

So, about 4-5 months was the shortest amount of time I had a car. That wasn't the shortest amount of time I drove a car, though. That would be my Mom's '86 Monte Carlo. She gave it to me in March of '98, and I totaled it on June 15, 1998, when I got t-boned delivering pizzas. So I had that one on the road for 3 months. I kept it around until early 1999, though. At first because I wanted to fix it up, but then I just gave up, let it sit, and ultimately I sold it to a guy who wanted it for parts."
2417	March 1, 2005 3:51PM	michaellno	"4 weeks, back in 1998 .. Ford Expedition in early November, VW New Beetle in early December. Paid the reg. fees for both cars at the same time ... $1000!

Lately have been on a 12 month cycle, every November ('02, '03 and '04). I expect to break that string this year."
2418	March 1, 2005 4:11PM	andre1969	"to hold out, but I've caught myself on occasion perusing the web pages of various local dealerships and used car lots. I think I've pretty much decided that if I go brand-new, it's gonna be a Charger or a 300C. But going used opens up a whole bunch of other possibilities.

The dealership network that I bought my Intrepid from currently has an '04 Intrepid SE for sale for sale for $12,872. It has 13,385 miles on it. If it weren't for the color combo (white with a taupe interior), I'd really be tempted. It would almost be like getting a new car again. But then, I'd be in a cheaper version of what I already have (they did a lot of cost-cutting on the Intrepid after 2000; I think most of it was in 2002), just with a lot less miles, and I'd be starting all over again with car payments."
2419	March 1, 2005 4:15PM	nippononly	"if you are going to get back into payments, at least try on something new for size!

How about a 300 Touring for you?
Or maybe the Hemi? :-)"
2420	March 1, 2005 6:12PM	trucker50	I'm not talking about the shortest time between buying cars in general, rather the shortest time before trading in or selling a recently purchased car for another?
2421	March 1, 2005 6:25PM	guss	"for me was one year on an 87 Sentra. However that one year was like seven dog years to me.

I learned something about myself though. I need to have some goodies in a car. This Sentra was a price leader for the dealership and had nothing on it. No air , two door, cheap vinyl seats and AM only radio.

Traded it for a Suzuki Samauri. It was cheap also, but it was a 4x4 and best of all, a convertible."
2422	March 1, 2005 6:32PM	andre1969	"yeah, that's just it, if I want to get back into payments, I sure don't want to be doing it on what amounts to the same car! About a year and a half ago, I did come close to doing just that, though. My dealer had an '02 Intrepid R/T on the lot, black, fully loaded, 35K miles, marked down to $15,995. At the time I had about 86,000 on my car, and they would've given me what I owed on it, which was about $4800 at the time. Had I driven the R/T and decided that I wanted it, I would've tried negotiating a bit further, but once I drove it, it just wasn't as thrilling as I thought it would be. It was faster than my car, but not as much faster as I thought it would be. Or, at least, not enough to make me want to practically start over with payments again.

At that time, I probably could've gotten a 4 year term for about the same monthly payment as the 5-year on my car. But at this point I'd still owe about 2 1/2 years on it, and it's just SO NICE right now to not have a car payment! :-)

And I'm sure a 300 Touring would be enough car for me. Heck, if I'm not mistaken the 3.5 in the Touring/Limited is actually a bit quicker than it was in the 300M/Intrepid R/T, SXT, etc. But I have a feeling that if I bought one, I'd still be aching for the Hemi! But I wonder what a 5-year loan would run on one of those? Probably close to $600, with a modest amount down? I'm just not ready to blow that kind of money just yet!"
2423	March 1, 2005 7:20PM	driftracer	"3 days, then 2 days...

In 1997, we bought a program 1996 Taurus wagon, my wife just HAD to have it...I hated it, and she actually did, too after driving it for more than a couple of hours. Bought it cheap, traded it for what we paid for it on the next one...

We then bought one of the newly released 1997 Expeditions, but it was too tall to fit in our garage...traded it at another dealership - the Expeditions were so hot back them, they gave us close to MSRP in trade.

So 2 days later, we bought a 1997 Thunderbird V-8."

Could anybody fill me in on them? I've always liked the style of them, and since something like this would be a toy (albeit an expensive one), I wouldn't be too worried about interior/trunk room. Just as long as I can fit in it, that is!

Do these things get troublesome as they age?

I know this is probably out of character for me, thinking about a car like that. And maybe I'll change my mind when I sober up, but I'll still have this post to incriminate me! ;-)"

I was under the impression that the newer Jags were much more reliable than the ones of days gone by. Especially after Ford took control, I heard that the quality really went up. Although I know that sounds pretty ironic!

So Jags still get pretty cranky as they age, then, even the newer ones?"
2429	March 3, 2005 1:53PM	driftracer	"and engine management problems, although NOTHING like the former versions.

Still, for the money, there are many more reliable alternatives. The older Jaguars have style, though, and that attracts people who overlook the reliability quirks."
2430	March 3, 2005 2:01PM	corvette	There was a column in Autoweek about Jaguars. The author had told a lady friend that there was nothing wrong with buying a Jaguar (in 1992 or so), nor had there ever been, if it's what she wanted. She bought one and still owns and loves it. Hard to believe, but that sounds like a true loyalist. Most of us tend to be more practical and steer someone to a more dependable car!

Anyway, I don't know if it's an SS or not, but I think it's just a smallblock. My buddy said his brother thinks it's a 327, but not sure. I don't think the 350 came out until '69, though? I guess it could just be a 307, as well. It's been repainted, but I don't know how well, or what color.

Anyway, they want $24-25K for it. I told him that, off the top of my head, it's probably worth about half that, or even less. According to the Hemming's price guide my buddy has, a '68 Impala in #2 condition is around $15K, and an SS is ~$18K. When you get into big blocks, it's more like $24-30K."

Oh yeah, I did some checking, and I think the 350 did come out in 1968. IIRC both it and the 327 were available that year, and then the 327 was phased out for '69.

Weren't most, if not all, of the smallblock Chevy automatics that year just Powerglides? I really wish I could go with my buddy and his brother this weekend to look at that car... I'll fill in the details as I discover them, though!"

2447	March 4, 2005 8:39PM	ghulet	"...the 350 actually debuted in '67 (on the Camaro SS only), it wasn't available on full-size or Chevelles til MY '69. Hence, all '68 full-sizers had a six, 307, 327s, 396s or 427s. The TH was technically available, IIRC, with V8s, but the Powerglide was also available with anything smaller than a 427; the majority you'll see with small-blocks will be Powerglides, unfortunately.

My neighbor had a low-option 307 PG convertible, bit of a bondo bucket, she bought for $2k around 1982-83. Guess she could have kept it. I think a fairly nice small block convertible should run about $15k, I can't see $25k unless it's a bit special (small-block SS, maybe a 396 non-SS), otherwise highly optioned or very, very nice. That said, Impala SS427 coupes and convertibles are running $30k+ even in bad shape. So, as is usually the case, especially for Chevies, values are all over the place."
2448	March 5, 2005 5:31AM	corvette	I know I'm beating a dead horse here, but the Lemon Law provides no exceptions for non-availability of parts. It's not your problem!

I'm scared to try to get them to do the buyback, tried it a few years ago with another vehicle, ended up out several thousand dollars and got nothing for it. I owned the vehicle 3 months and it sat for 2 months in the shop, finally just traded it in and took the hit.

Everyday they tell me the parts will be there and so far they don't have them, including a part that was ordered 3 months ago to cure the engine noise."

I don't mean to sound harsh, but the laws are in place for a reason, and it takes minimal action on your part to make things happen. If you won't take action, nothing's going to happen.

Personally, I can't help someone who won't help themselves, and being the ""eternal victim"" has no satisfaction and no sympathy."
2451	March 5, 2005 6:49PM	akangl	I did contact an attorney years ago about a vehicle, paid him $2k to fight it for us, we lost.
2452	March 5, 2005 6:58PM	driftracer	an attorney who knows what he's doing - but you said that the attorney was for suing a car dealership, not pursuing lemon law. Lemon law is cut and dried.
2453	March 5, 2005 9:41PM	corvette	I'm sure it's different in Alaska, there may be only one attorney in the whole state that specializes in lemon law. If the lemon law in Alaska allows for recovery of attorney's fees, you shouldn't be out anything.
2454	March 5, 2005 10:05PM	driftracer	Precisely, and I haven't seen a state's lemon law YET that doesn't allow for recovery - even Mag-Moss allows it. All they need is a fee petition, which is a very common thing in the lawyer world.

Overall it's actually a pretty sweet looking car, although I dunno if I'd pay $24.9K for it! It's at a classic/exotic car dealership in a snooty part of Annapolis, practically right on the water, so I'm guessing they have to charge extra-high prices to cover the rent!

I haven't lost one day of service from any car I ever bought new as a result of mechanical failure, excepting the poopy Saturn, and even that got me around for two years before it started dropping its guts all over the road.

Counting my lucky stars here..."

Next week, I'll go in for visit #11 and and a front axle. Also noted, while waxing it for the first time (it's a NEW truck), that there are paint defects all over the driver's side and hood, looks like dirt or other contaminants under the paint.

If it wasn's so annoying, it'd be funny. Then again, doing what I do for who I do it for, it's easy to get the relief ball rolling - the lawsuit was filed 2 weeks ago.

Then again, there's no more 2004 Dakotas out there, and I hate the 2005 body style, so I'll just have to buy aftermarket differentials and hope the repaint goes well, and maybe pay cash for the new motorcycle, courtesy of DaimlerChrysler.

It is the illusion of a strong and safe place to be for Mom and the kids when driving.

2482	March 8, 2005 11:11PM	steine13	"... my brothers and sisters, for I have sinned.
At least I'm working on it.

Emboldened by advertised lease deals, I spent a quality 30 minutes today at the local Toyota dealership...

The vehicle was a 2wd 4cyl Highlander. I'm not a big SUV fan, but this is as close to a Camry wagon as one can get these days. And it was NICE.

Certainly not as smooth as the V6 -- I've got that in the Sienna -- but very nice for a four, only the transmission got a little busy for my taste when I dug my foot in. I've found that one can 'learn' a transmission pretty well, though. Wish there'd be a 5sp stick...

I'm surprised this car isn't a much bigger seller; 27/23 mpg EPA, good power, and a very solid cruiser with OK handling and good room.

Now about the deal: With nothing down, it's $250/month, with the 6% tax either rolled in, or not... that's where the haggling comes in.

It's a pretty darned good deal as written. The residual is 62%, which is NUTS, plus they're discounting the car a couple or three grand. The lease deal is better than the buy, IMO.

I don't think I'll do it, though. Leasing gives me the creeps. I think I'd worry about every scratch and ding; I really don't have a feel for what is ok upon return. [This is where you guys come in to alleviate my fears and push me over the edge. Feel free.]

Between the ""so much a month"" mentality and the Toyota/Honda reputation, the resale on these is stronger than makes any sense.

Consider this: In order to finance the whole ball of wax -- $22,5 + 6% tax -- and for the payment to be at the $250 level, I have to stretch it out to 10 years. TEN years at 4.5%.

Of course, I need another new Toyta the way I need mumps, and I'm really tired of the Sienna payments ($5k left)... but wow, what a deal.

Someone slap me. Please.

Yesterday I noticed the rubber hoses that run from the tranny to the radiator are leaking at the radiator, and this morning it did something that I thought cars stopped doing decades ago...sprung a rain water leak at the front passenger door seal!

So I guess that means my Intrepid is now officially an old car! I know both of the problems I mentioned are really minor, but it does kind of drive home the point that it ain't new anymore, and there might be more problems to come!

Two questions -- how long and how many miles is the lease for? I presume that this would be a true ""second"" car, and to be honest, other than the Sienna, I don't really know what else is in your stable (Vibe? Prism? Both?).

I wonder what percentage of the American public would recall the existence of the Mirada if you asked them. ;-)

or know what a slant six is. ""Is that a type of windowshades?"""
2492	March 9, 2005 1:26AM	andyman73	You are so right, how many of them, out there, would know what a Mirada or slant six is? How far things have come since then.
2493	March 9, 2005 1:51AM	fitguy	"So cool to hear the words ""slant 6""- I owned 3, including a '65 Barracuda; girlfriend back then owned 2. We kept 'em running forever, cheaply. Remember back: you could even remove/replace the starter from the engine bay! I did 2 engine swaps with slant 6's by myself, one day each. Ahh, those were the days! Now my Expedition takes hours just to replace spark plugs.
The Mirada, on the other hand, was a very forgettable automobile."
2494	March 9, 2005 2:04AM	andre1969	"most people would probably thing a slant 6 is slang for some kind of erectile dysfunction!

My '69 Dart GT had a 225 slant 6, and that was one sweet, smooth running little engine. The only really annoying aspect that I remember was getting to the distributor and the spark plugs. The engine leaned over them, shadowing them like the Andrea Doria getting ready to capsize!

They also didn't take too well to emissions controls. I think it was partly because the slant six was normally a cool running engine, and for improved emissions they usually made them run hotter. Plus, by the time the Mirada came around, it was down to 85-90 hp. I shudder to think what the 0-60 time would be in something like that! Or worse, the full-sized Newports, Gran Furys, and St. Regises that it also went into!

Back over the summer, I came close to buying the Mirada's sister, a 1980 Chrysler Cordoba. It originally had a slant six, but by this time had a built-up 318 out of a mid-70's Dart, and a Torqueflite 727 and 8.75 suregrip rear out of a '69 or '70 Charger. It also had copcar rims on it, which gave it a tough, no-nonsense look about it. And, this must've been fairly rare for this type of car in 1980, but it had bucket seats and a floor shift!"

As I am one one the dysfunctional chronic-car buyer types, I have satisfied my modern-car stable (for now) and am on the hunt for late-60's Mopar mid-size ragtop, or GM midsize.

2501	March 10, 2005 1:48AM	steine13	"Hiya Walt,

It's all a matter of your frame of reference... as an SUV, I agree, the 4yl 2wd HL is a loser vehicle.

When viewed as a ""Camry Wagon"", it's fine. And don't worry, I'm not going to get it now... I've got $40 sitting on the curb now, why up it to $60... even with other people's money. And I realize that $20/vehicle ain't much these days, but I've got a 2-mile commute, so what's the point.

Actually, that's one reason I don't like the 6cyl; I get absolutely atrocious mileage with big engines... Ford 4.0 or Toyota 3.0 or Chev 254 or Chev 5.0: 10-13 mpg in January has been normal. Gimme a Corolla or similar with less thermal mass, and it's 23-26 mpg. I realize it's not a big deal with my low miles, but it's just such a waste, and I do drive to the lab 2-3 times on a normal day.

One thing I do like to do is go canoeing, and you wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a vehicle that'll haul 130 lbs safely on the roof. The HL will haul 165 lbs and is easy to set up. The Sienna is good, too, but...

""In time, I think you would miss the Sienna""

Is that supposed to be funny? 24 hours after the wife creamed a deer in her 98, I was unhorsed and haven't put 50 miles on that thing by myself.

It's strictly my wife's car, she needs it to do antique shows and it's the family transport for substantial trips. Going canoeing? 04 Vibe or 99 Prizm... preferably the former. 29 mpg with an 18 ft boat, but not enough room for two adults, two kids, and the requisite gear.

And no, you would not ""rather have my [Prizm] for $3k"", cuz the suspension is 'all wore out', to use the vernacular. Just an around-town beater, but a good one. It's pretty much sold, though.

I may or may not lease something when the Sienna is paid off... I would buy that one again in a heartbeat, but I'm tired of payments. Maybe a nice $6k vehicle will come my way this spring...

If I want to save up money to buy a V6 AWD HL, that'll take a few years... I agree, though, that's nice. It's just overkill for what I need.

Thanks for the advice.. ""friends don't let friends buy bad cars"".

We are headed to anchorage on Friday to take the popup to the dealer. Hopefully it stays there and doesn't follow us home. They offered us a killer deal on the camper we wanted last summer but couldn't afford to buy, plus the bank offered us a great interest rate on the new camper.

2508	March 11, 2005 12:45AM	corvette	"I swung by the closest Toyota dealer tonight. About half the Highlanders were stripped models (4 cyl 2wd, sticker in the $25-6ish range). No sunroof, no side balloons. The other alternative is a V6 AWD model (not the Limited), $29-31ish, most with third-row seats, they all have sunroofs and side balloons. There were a few AWD Limiteds in the $35ish range. Very little variation in options. According to the lease questions discussion, the residual value is greater on the base model than the Limited. The lease deal is still really, really good on the V6 4wd, looks to be cheaper than a Pilot, but I don't know how boring a Highlander would be.

Oh, my Altima still doesn't produce heat when it's idling. I know there may be air in the cooling system (although they claim to have bled the air out per the TSB), but I also know my 2002 model has a smaller heater core than subsequent years, and they enlarged it partly due to this problem. And all of the windows freeze shut in cold weather--I need them to roll down to swipe my parking pass to get into the parking structure. And the right rear door (part of the car that was hit) won't shut when it's cold unless I jiggle the inside latch. It may see a trip to CarMax (We'll Buy Your Car!) in the coming week."
2509	March 11, 2005 3:00AM	akangl	"****what type of camper do you have now and which one did you want?****

We currently have a 2004 Jayco Eagle 10SG popup, nothing but trouble with it. Heck, it sat in the yard and developed cracks in the body. Don't really like it when it comes to camping, too cold (furnace can't be trusted to work). Just not our cup of tea really. Thought we could live with it, but its like settling for a Chevy Cavalier when you really wanted a Subaru WRX Sti, lol.

Anyway, the dealer has a model of the camper we wanted last summer still on the lot, so they made us a good deal on it. Its a 2004 Fleetwood Wilderness Yukon 24BH. Now if the Titan doesn't cough up a drivetrain pulling it we will be fine, lol.

Thought the deal was in the toilet today since they expressed hesitation about our camper and its damaged body. Service manager looked things over and contacted Jayco who agreed to warranty it."

On the no heat thing Corvette, my Celica does the same thing at idle before its completely warmed up, and I suspect it has to do with lack of coolant circulation while the thermostat is closed. The blower fan cools off the heater core tto the ambient outside air, and cold thru the vents is what you get."

Have no desire to trade it, none at all. I like the truck. It has to go back in for a couple other things that they didn't fix, but other than that seems fine.

2521	March 12, 2005 6:09PM	andre1969	"don't get me started on campers and motorhomes! Ever since I was a little kid, I've always been fascinated with camping and recreational vehicles, although I haven't actually gone on a camping trip since I was 15. Back then my grandparents had a '76 GMC 3/4 ton crew cab and a 10 foot slide in truck camper by Skamper. A few years later, the Greaseman (a shock jock, for those of you who don't know) would make the word ""Scamper"" famous for meaning something else, but back then who knew?

Anyway, that was the last year Granddad had his '76. He had bought an '85 Silverado, which I still have, but it's just a half-ton truck, and really couldn't haul the camper safely. Granddad put the camper on the back of the truck and drove it around the block one day, didn't like how queasy it felt, and that was that. He eventually sold the '76, and the camper sat for a few years, until after Granddad died, and then my uncle gave it to a relative.

Sometimes I wish my truck was a 3/4 ton or heavier, because I'd love to get a slide-in camper for it and go on camping trips. They don't make campers for 1/2 ton trucks, do they? I'd imagine if they do they'd be extremely basic. But then again, our old Skamper was, too! Granddad had pulled out the water and holding tank to get more storage, so the only way you could use the sink was at a campground with hookups. And it did have a little portable toilet in one of the closets, but the whole time we had it nobody ever used it. It really was roughing it, but it was fun!"

Unfortunately, the commute stayed the same at 36 miles each way but there's less traffic at the new office and it's more money with better hours.

My Accord is doing great at 13,000 miles. Have some brake vibration but rather than take it back to the dealer to let them machine the rotors again I will drive it till it's unbearable and get some aftermarket brakes.

I will hate to see our Ody go back. It's hasn't had a single problem, rattle, or creak in the 10,000 miles/1 year we have owned it. Residual is $20,000. Thinking about buying an Element when the van goes back but come to think of it, the Ody gets better gas mileage than an AWD Element. Hmm.. and at about the same price the van is a lot more car for the $$$$.

Gee's Si has 30,000 miles on it and he can't think of anything to replace it with even though I gave him free reign to go buy anything as long as it had side curtain airbags.

akangl: The camper looks nice. It does match your truck.

As ugly as you think the Ridgeline is I very seriously doubt it will have the same teething problems your Titans have had. Maybe you should try to go back to Ford or Chevy until Nissan gets more experience building trucks.

Do you still work at Walmart? I know you were thinking about going to work as a service advisor right?

steine: The Highlander sounds like a great deal IF you need it. But it doesn't appear that you do. You could always sell the Sienna and take the equity (I'm assuming it would be a decent amount because of your low payoff) and pay for the Highlander lease. That would make the Highlander almost free and would probably save you money in gas as well."

I had a '70 Camaro when I first started driving, man I loved that car. It caught on fire (got it fixed and kept it a couple more years) but in my memory that was the best car I ever had, wish I still had it. I guess love is truly blind.

I wonder if it's not so much Nissan can't build a pick-up as where it's built. Case in point the lousy quality of VW's made in Mexico. That deal with assembly line workers scratching the paint on Titans going down the line from their jewelery is a good example.

Maybe it's the manufacturers themselves. Toyota's and Honda's made in America are annually listed in the top 2 in quality, equal to anything made in Japan, yet Mazda's made in America don't seem to be made as well as Mazda's made in Japan. We'll see if Toyota can maintain their quality at their new Tacoma plant in Mexico....worker's their make 20-30% more then any other factory workers in Mexico 3-4 dollars an hour....I'm sure their labor savings will be passed on to us at the sticker....yeah right"
2535	March 13, 2005 8:07PM	corvette	The VW/Mexico thing was covered in another topic.

Pretty nice, but I don't care for the styling. Some cost cutting from the previous generation--no more chrome sill around the trunk, no more illuminated vents (deleted in 2004). It has the hair-trigger throttle, just like my old VR6. 2.5 liter I5 was not as smooth as the VR6. From the short test drive, I'm not sold on it at all.

I did the test drive at Neil Huffman Volkswagen in Louisville, KY. The salesman fit the stereotype. He recounted how, when he bought his last car, he looked at the lots at night, when the dealerships were closed, and narrowed it down to two cars before he involved a salesperson--and made some other remarks basically implying I was wasting his time. If VW doesn't completely kill itself with its quality problems, its dealers will finish the task with their poor salesmanship and service."

2543	March 15, 2005 5:43AM	corvette	Well, my little faux pas was mentioning that my Altima was a great car, just really boring. The salesman replied that he owns and loves his 5-speed 3.5 SE.

Fair enough, he was short on the social graces earlier in our meeting.

$11,000 ACV at Swope Discount Autocenter in Louisville, KY. CarMax offered $10,400.

Terry said $10,900 six months and 6,000 miles ago, before I had the bodywork redone. I went to CarMax first and was thrilled with the $10,400 offer. The salesman was very pleasant to work with, and I test drove a used black 330ci that was rather dirty (inside and out) and had a smell in the HVAC.

I went to Swope (the biggest dealer group in the Louisville area), who also advertises that they will purchase cars outright. They had recently marked down a black 330ci, and I wanted to take a look at it. It was priced suspiciously low--$19,xxx. The salesman claimed it was being auctioned the next day. Fine, whatever, just appraise my car. He returns from the appraisal and asks what I was hoping to get for the car. I ask point-blank what it appraised at, and he eventually tells me $11,000 even. I ask if that offer is a cash purchase price, and he answers in the affirmative. He then finds the 330ci, and I take a look at it. The original asking price in the window was $26,900. I ask how it got marked down to $19,xxx on their website, and he replies that they only keep inventory 30 days. I ask to see a CarFax, and get the response that they have already sold the car to another dealer. Yeah, right! They did make good on their offer to purchase my Nissan, though.

So, I'm driving Dad's Canyon until I get tired of it and pick something else out. Audi A3 looks nice, but I doubt if there will be a factory supported lease for quite some time."
2546	March 17, 2005 12:22AM	driftracer	"One of my best friends wants to buy my Saturn Ion Redline from me (pay it off) and sell me his 1994 Mustang GT (well modded, I did most of the work). He's in the Air Force and stationed at AAFES/HQ in Dallas, lives in Ft Worth near his kids, and the V-8 Mustang gets 18 mpg downhill with a tailwind. My Ion Redline can hang with his Mustang, and gets 22/28...and he commutes 100 miles a day, plus the weekend runaround.

We've talked about it, agreed to terms, sleeping on it, discussing it with the wives, etc. I may meet him in Indianapolis next weekend to swap cars, who knows...

The other thought is to bug my good ol' buddy Dan (danf1), see what my Redline is worth on trade at the Saturn dealer I bought it from - weird - no guides post a value for it, and KBB doesn't even know it exists - I'd be looking at a 2004 GTO w/6-speed. They have some great rebates, I just have to see if the dealer (Dan's group) has any left, and what the numbers would boil down to with trading my Redline...

Either way, I want a V-8 with a manual...I should have stepped up and did just that at the outset, but I was being conservative - should have known conservative wouldn't fit me."

Only problem you'll find is that most of the 1200-1500 '04's still on dealer lots are autos - the 6 speeds are more in demand and thus command the higher end of the price range.

I met one guy locally who leased (there was a special program w/incredibly high residuals) his yellow GTO for 24 months for $0 (after the GM card,rebate, invoice pricing). A free car for 2 years courtesy of GM!

They account for $240 of the monthly bill ($364) with their liability-only coverage.

Your house sounds a lot like mine, except for the ""sporty cars"" bit. I've been with State Farm for close to 20 years (12 with my current agent here in CO). Son ($199/mo for a 2001 Saturn L200) writes us a check for his monthly insurance bill, while the daughter ($156/mo for a 2003 Ford Focus ZX5) just deposits money into her savings account and we transfer it over to our account when the bill is due. The other two cars (2003 Saturn L300 and 2004 Saturn VUE) cost us, I think, $200/mo for insurance.

All cars have 100/300/100 coverage, uninsured motorist, $0 deductible windshield repair (handy in Colorado!) and medical.

The scary part is that the son has several speeding tickets and one accident on his resume, while the daughter qualifies for both a good student and driving school discounts.

After an initial offer of $7000, they settled in on $7900. You hit the number right on the button.

Thanks Again - Damon"
2596	March 27, 2005 2:25PM	ddelise	"Ok -

Here's the deal. My current lease has 2 payments remaining at $410 each.

I started my shopping this month (a Vibe or a Maxx) and let the dealers know up front I was a couple of months out to making my final decision. And they were cool with that. I also let them know I am eligible for GM Supplier pricing, and have GM Card Earnings. Unfortunately the two programs are no longer allowed together, so I asked if they would honor the Supplier price to allow me to use my earnings. Each said Yes.

I have chosen the Maxx, and then asked the dealer to see what models qualify for the additional $1000 March Madness cash. Just curious of course...

She came back to me with 2 LS models and 6 LT models that qualify. She then put me on the phone with the finance manager to discuss a lease cost. All numbers were the same as Car_Man has indicated to me in the Lease Questions forum, and then they dropped the bomb that the LS has $2500 lease cash and the LT $2000 lease cash (including the March Madness money). This is $1000 and $500 more lease cash respectively than Car_Man or GM sites indicate. Clearly they are passing along every incentive to try and get me to make a deal.

My final question was then about the dealer fee of $500 (yes, that much in Florida). I said with the Supplier Program the fee is waived. They came back and said that they are making $30 on the sale of the car at the Supplier Price and not marking up the finance rate at all and passing along every rebate to me, so there is no more room for them. But they then said it is the end of the month (and quarter I suspect), so they will ask the General Manager.

Two hours later I get a phone call. They said they must show the $500 fee in the deal on the contract, but will then cut me a check for $500 - so in a sense the fee is $0.

Bottom line is I can lease the Maxx LS for about $175 and the LT for about $205. Both include tax, no cap cost, and startups (first payment, tax, tag) due at signing.

Should I pull the trigger and eat the remaining payments on my car?

Should I hold out until my lease is over and see what deals are out there then?

And I will say this dealer is awesome to deal with - totally upfront with price, rebates, financing, etc. They are motivated to sell a Maxx!

Thoughts - comments - questions - all welcome!

Thanks - Damn"
2597	March 27, 2005 3:29PM	rroyce10	"...... 36 months .....?? ... sounds like a deal to me ...

Terry."
2598	March 27, 2005 3:42PM	ddelise	"Thanks for the feedback (but keep it coming!).

I have the old original GM card with the 5% earnings, and they no longer allow that to be combined with the Supplier Program (nice 'feature' GM came out with about 3 years ago or so). So the dealer is going to honor the Supplier Price but not go through the program, that is why the Doc fee is still in play.

And the deal is for 36 month - I think I am going to go ahead and keep the Volvo in the garage for 2 months and turn it in on first day possible.

One minor change is that I found out (thanks Car_Man) the lease interest rate is 3.5%, not 4.5%. I did know that about two weeks ago (or 700 diaper changes ago...), but forgot. I bet that difference is how they are rebating me the dealer fee. I think I will ask them to split the difference with me - 4% - and then I will be there signing paperwork before the end of the month.

I'll say this much though...it won't be anything too out of the ordinary or shocking considering the type of car I usually go for. So it's not like I'll be showing up with a Prius or Aveo, but at the other end of the spectrum it won't be an Avalanche, Corvette, Hemi Ram, etc!

I definitely want to take a look at the new IS when it is available in a few months, and also want to check out the new GTI (or maybe Jetta) with the 2.0T and the manual shift when THEY come out. Maybe by then VW dealers will have given in and these cars will be selling several thousand $$ lower than they are right now.

And I am jealous - how is it someone already has A3s in their area to try out? Although either way this is another model where the manual is coming later right?"

It has just over 10,000 miles on it now and has been GREAT. I'm gonna hate to see it go back but the residual is a little high IMHO but that's what made it such a great deal so I'm not complaining.
2620	April 7, 2005 1:07AM	anonymousposts	lancer: If it's a great deal, it's a car you want, and you can afford it then why not buy it? There is always a market for a nice Benz so even if you get it and begin to loathe it you can sell it to someone else.

Maybe I should start cruising for a bargain used car again. Or one of them give away leases...

I have the lease scenerio all worked out to confuse the wife, and convince her we are saving money (or at least improving cash flow). Sell my Scion, pay off her Ody, put some of the difference (Scion's worth more than the payoff) into the lease drive off, and the lease payment will be less than the current loan payment.

hence, we ""save"" money, and I get (possibly) a nicer car. The cash flow overlaps for ~33 months (only been paying on the van for 3-4 at this point).

I'll just ignore the fact that in 3 years, I have nothing, instead of a 3 year old tC.

Gee, I should have been working in the accounting dapartment of Enron!

Now, all I have to do is convince Audi to have a blow-out intro lease deal. Or maybe no one will want the FWD version of the A3?"

Anyway, I wonder if it's time to start dropping clues? At this point the only thing I'm going to say is that it's NOT silver! I know that's not much of a clue. But after driving a silver Intrepid for 102,000 miles, and a silver Gran Fury copcar for about 45,0000 miles, and also having Mom's old gray-over-silver '86 Monte and Grandma's gray '85 LeSabre, I don't want another silver/gray car for a long, long time! Oh, BTW, my Dad's '03 Regal, which has me listed as a co-owner to keep it out of probate if anything happens to him, is silver too!

I'll say this, too, though...it's not a 1981 Diplomat, or anything from 1981. Although a 1981 Diplomat coupe in that nice frosty green color with a white landau roof and the alloy wheels they offered back then (NO wire knockoffs!) would be kinda nice!"

On one hand, I liked having a hood to look out over again (something I always hated about my Intrepid), and I found visibility to be great from the front. But out the back it's horrible! Those rear windows, which look small enough from the outside, are about half that size when you look out of them! I also didn't like the way the tranny shifted. It just seemed like it was holding back, somehow, and wasting the engine's power. It had a sticker price of around $26,200, and the salesman said, without any prompting, that I could probably get it for around $24K. It was kind of a graphite color. They had another one in Magnesium, which is probably the color I'd get if I did get one of these cars. It had leather and a few more options, and was stickered at $27K. However, it was a demo, and had about 3000 miles on it. All the salesman said was ""you could get this one for less than the other"".

Does she drive the Accord in your profile? One of my friends has a 1994 Accord EX that has received the full Taliban attack treatment ('abuse' doesn't even begin to describe it, although she swears she changed the oil every 7500 miles and did the timing belt on schedule), and recently cracked its block at just over 200,000 miles (which probably had nothing to do with the lax maintenance).

I had forgotton about how nice an interior could look that was not a sea of that awful medium gray or beige. I know it's probably not cost effective, but I wonder if interiors other than gray or beige on some new cars (as a cost option) would sell? :confuse:

That's it - The Firebird Esprit. It was similar to the Berlinetta - a chick Firebird. IIRC, it had small, indiscreet bionic chickens on the B pillar instead of the real man's giant one on the hood."
2700	April 11, 2005 9:37PM	andre1969	"Bryan and Lemko pretty much got it. The next pic I was going to post was this...



which would've most likely had y'all pinpoint it down to something GM intermediate from '73-77.

Anyway, it's not a Can Am. Wish it was, but I like these cars enough that truthfully I would've been happy with a base LeMans 4-door (as long as it had at least a 350 and wasn't an overly pukey color! ), so a Can Am would have really been the icing on the cake.

It's a '76 Pontiac Grand LeMans. The Grand LeMans used the Grand Prix dashboard (as did the Can Am and the '73-75 Grand Am), where the base LeMans used a different dash layout. I didn't notice it at first, until Lemko said ""1977 LeMans"", but the while it was advertised as a '76, it does appear to be wearing the '77 Grand LeMans grille. I'll have to ask the owner about that. I've been looking at pics of these cars online, and noticed that a few of them have the wrong-year grille on them. The LeMans and Grand LeMans had different grilles, and they changed them both from '76-77, but they're all swappable. So I'm wondering if some previous owner just swapped in a grille that he liked better? Or maybe one of the sections got broken, and he could only find a '77 in the junkyard, so he took both pieces to make them match? I had to do something similar when I had my '82 Cutlass Supreme. One day I was showing off, and showing my friends how the grille inserts were on hinges, and folded inward to protect them in the event of an accident. Well, lo and behold, the danged thing broke off the moment I touched it! Naturally my friends laughed at it! :blush: That'll be the last time I brag about a GM product!!

Anyhow, I went to a junkyard, and the only Cutlass that would serve as a donor was an '82 Brougham, which had a different grille from the base Cutlass. So I had to buy both pieces to make it fit. And I never showed off that little ""feature"" again, for fear I'd break it again! BTW, my '79 Newport and '79 NYer grilles would do the same thing. Hinged on the top, they'd give a couple inches in light impacts. I never showed them off though, because, well, it's a bit harder to find an R-body grille than it is a Cutlass grille!

Plus, these things were only plastic, and being so upright (in the case of the LeMans) I'm sure it was fairly common for a rock or something to chip one side. I looked at a '76 LeMans coupe with a Chevy 6 about 4 years ago, and one of the sides was cracked on it.

Anyway, here are a few more pics of it. I'm posting links because they're too wide to post here...

BTW, anybody know about what kind of fuel economy a Pontiac 350-2bbl would get on the highway? Do I need to take out another loan on the house? :surprise: I know the 350 isn't a particularly thirsty engine, as cars of this vintage go, but with today's prices... :mad:"

http://www.abodysite.com/buford28.jpg

They also had a bunch of these in ""Smokey and the Bandit: Part 2"" for the big smashup scene at the end. When Buford and his brothers tried to ambush the Bandit out in the desert somewhere between Dallas and Florida (of which I believe there isn't one!), all the cars they showed lined up were brand-new, 1980 LeManses (probably every one Pontiac sold that year!) But when they started actually smashing them up, they tuned into old early 70's Polaras, Coronets, a bunch of '76-77 LeManses, and even AMC Matadors! There was also a scene in the third Smokey and the Bandit, where a local cop gets into it with Buford. The local is driving a '76 LeMans, and Buford is in one of those little early 80's Bonneville G's, which in theory would've been crushed by that LeMans. But, being as this was Hollywood, Buford runs the local into a broken-down Vega, and the LeMans does a pretty spectacular wipeout. This is probably going to disturb some of you, but I even found a picture of that!



It'll be interesting though, to find out what kind of mileage this beast gets on the highway.

Mark156...

The owner is telling me that he thinks it only has 76,000 miles on it. He hasn't had it very long, though. He bought it a couple years ago from an older guy who was fixing it up with his son. But then the son went into the military, and the father didn't want to drive around in a car like that. It was too much car for him! I know that sounds funny considering that its 350 only had like 160 hp, but it has a shift kit in it, so maybe that makes it more jerky? And sometimes, even though they still don't take off that fast, those big cars can throw you back in your seat and at least make you THINK you're going somewhere! Originally, this guy thought the car had more like 170,000 miles, because of the age, but then when he saw the odometer statement on the paperwork said it hadn't been rolled over, well with the condition of the interior and such, he was inclined to believe it. One thing about GM cars from this era is that even when they're well-taken care of, the carpet, vinyl, and hard plastic all seems to fade at different rates, so after a length of time your interior ends up being like 3 or 4 different colors! And this one looks like it's still pretty much the same color inside! The build quality is typical 70's, but most of the flaws that I've seen on the interior look like it came that way from the factory. And heck, I've seen some newer GM cars, like my Dad's '03 Regal, that have fit and finish that's no better! The guy that's selling it decided he wanted more muscle though, so he just bought a '74 Grand Am, which is why he's selling this one. It had been on eBay, and truthfully, the pics he had posted didn't do it justice. Once he sent me some higher-res pics of it though, right after he washed it, I really fell in love!

Drift, yeah it would be nice with a 455. Maybe if the 350 in this one ever blows... But (un)fortunately, Pontiac V-8s (pre-301) back then were pretty good engines, so usually something else major would go wrong with the car before the engine! I heard that the main reason Pontiac V-8's were discontinued was because they tended to run cool, and didn't take too well to emissions controls once they got stricter. But not to worry, because it doesn't have to go through the emissions test in MD! 1977 and up would have to, but since I'm getting historic tags for it, it would be a moot point anyway.

Hey, is that a sign that you're getting old when cars that you remember being brand-new when you were a kid are suddenly eligible for antique status?"

I think you're getting old when cars you remember as new are now in the junkyard. I feel that way already."
2708	April 12, 2005 1:09AM	andre1969	"I would've addressed it earlier, but your message popped in while I was typing that long one. I've heard Lemko mention a few times that he hates the '73-77 GM intermediates. He could probably explain it better, but I think it's mainly because he likes the '68-72 intermediates so much better. And to be fair, the '68-72's were a great style, and could be had with some powerful engines.

The 1973 intermediates did away with all hardtops and convertibles, leaving only 2- and 4-door pillared models, along with wagons, although they all had frameless door windows, just like a Subaru! GM did this in reaction to proposed federal guidelines that regulated rollover protection, and would have most likely made it too expensive to make a hardtop or convertible to comply. In a rare move of GM moving too fast for once, they came out with these ""Colonade"" pillared hardtops, as they were called, in anticipation of these new regs, and the regs never materialized!

Still, it was destined to happen anyway. 4-door hardtops were never popular in the compact and intermediate lineups, although they were a mainstay for larger cars, especially luxury models like the Electra, 98, DeVille, New Yorker, etc. AFAIK Chrysler never offered a midsize 4-door hardtop, unless you want to count the shrunken standard Dodges and Plymouths around '62-64. Ford offered a Torino 4-door hardtop around 70-71, but it was a slow seller. As for 2-door hardtops, they started to fall by the wayside as it became evident in the 70's that ""personal luxury"" and pimpy was the in-thang, and as opera windows and thickly-padded roofs came into vogue, and air conditioning was installed on the majority of cars, nobody cared if the rear windows rolled down or not.

I have a history book that calls the '73-77 GM intermediates ""The last all-new designs in the traditional GM way of building cars...big on the outside, small on the inside, heavy, posh, and thirsty""! These monsters were kind of the antithesis of the trim, sporty '68-72 models. If it's any consolation though, the LeMans I'm getting is still smaller than its Ford or Mopar counterparts of the era! Its wheelbase is 112"", and overall length is ""only"" 208"" And I think it's actually a touch UNDER 4000 lb! :shades:"

2710	April 12, 2005 1:06PM	mark156	"Andre, one reason that Lemko might not like the '73-'77 models is that the ""5 mile and hour impact"" front bumpers were installed starting in '73. A lot of people in my car club will not look at anything past 1972 because of the larger bumpers and model years where the cars have pollution controls.

I'm a car nut, not a gear-head, so sometimes the ""mechanical"" information slips by me.

Mark"
2711	April 12, 2005 1:49PM	lemko	...was that the '73-77 intermediates initially switched to dual from quad headlights. It makes the cars look cheap.
2712	April 12, 2005 1:58PM	andre1969	"yeah, I didn't like that either. Back when I was a little kid, I used to equate quad headlights as a cue that a car was upscale from a car with single headlights. Interestingly, GM had to push to get government approval to start using rectangular headlights on their cars. They first showed up in '75 on some Caddy/Olds/Buick models, but didn't show up until '76 on the GM intermediates.

One of GM's arguments for rectangular headlights was that they would be smaller than round headlights, and therefore would allow for a lower hoodline that would improve visibility and aerodynamics a bit. So what do they do, then? They STACKED these rectangular headlights vertically on some cars, like the Chevelle, Monte Carlo, and Buick Century. So much for the lowered hoodline, huh?

http://www.abodysite.com/rr76buickcentury4dreddieburd01.jpg

And, back then, so went GM, so went the rest of the auto industry, so Ford started stacking the headlights on the LTD-II replacement for the Torino in '77, and Chrysler started stacking the headlights on the midsized Coronet/Monaco that year, too. The Cordoba followed suit in '78, IIRC.

My Mom had a '75 LeMans when I was a kid, and the single headlights were one thing I didn't like on that car. I thought that the '76, with its rectangular quad headlights was a massive improvement, and it also worked better with the massive 5 mph bumper."
2713	April 12, 2005 2:17PM	robr2	"Wasn't it the 1975 H body cars (Chevy Monza, Buick Skyhawk, Pontiac Astre, Oldsmobile Starfire) that were the first with the rectangular headlights?

Also, a web search showed that the Vega and Monza were sold side by side for a couple of years. Why?"
2714	April 12, 2005 2:28PM	andre1969	"I had completely forgotten about those clones! Here's a whole page full of ads for the Starfire, Sunbird, and Skyhawk... http://monza.homestead.com/cloneads.html

I think the reason the Vega and the Monza were sold concurrently for a few years was because Chevy wanted the Monza to go up against the Mustang II, while the Vega was more of a Pinto fighter. IIRC, didn't some Monzas and Sunbirds still use round headlights? I think there was a Monza notchback that used round headlights for a couple years, and maybe the Monza/Sunbird wagons?

Looks like all the Starfires and Skyhawks had rectangular headlights though, and those two both launched in '75. I had forgotten that the Sunbird didn't show up until '76.

I wonder what the last domestic car to use round headlights was? The New Yorker had round headlights, although they were hidden, as recently as the '79-81 generation. The Mark V also had them. Didn't the Mark VI also use a round headlight, hidden behind a cover? I also vaguely remember some hideous pimpy version that had a single headlight actually built into the cover, that made it look a bit like those 70's and 80's Stutz revivals. The '81-83 Imperial also had hidden headlights, but they were rectangular."
2715	April 12, 2005 2:42PM	nippononly	"I always held a special place of horror for those cars with the pop-up headlights where the lights were on the outside, exposed all the time. They looked like dual-eyed cyclops.

If a car had to have a pop-up exposed headlight, I preferred the style of the Porsche 928 where the light itself was all that popped up, then slid back into a hole perfectly sized for it."
2716	April 12, 2005 2:45PM	robr2	"I distinctly remember the Monza with the rectangular headlights and being very excited about it.

My Dad had a 75 Vega hatch with round headlights and then upgraded to a 79 Sunbird coupe with the rectangular headlights."
2717	April 12, 2005 3:08PM	andre1969	"I was really excited about the Chevy Monza as a kid, too! I had an old Matchbox slotless racecar set that had a Chevy Monza. I forget the other car that came with it...I think it was a Porshe 911! :P

When my Mom started thinking about getting a new car in 1980, she had thought about a Monza. That got me all excited. The other cars she was thinking about were a Plymouth Volare (My grandmother's cousin had a '79 Volare wagon in 2-tone black-over-silver with a red interior that my Mom liked) or a Pontiac LeMans (Mom was driving a '75 LeMans at the time).

She ended up getting a 1980 Malibu coupe, which was the same thing as the LeMans, but nicer looking IMO (those blunted beaks and single headlights just didn't work on the '78-80 LeMans) and about a hundred or so bucks cheaper."
2718	April 12, 2005 3:10PM	andre1969	"how back then, just something as simple as putting rectangular headlights versus round on a car would make it look so much more modern. At least, at the time I guess we thought it did. Today a lot of them just look like old cars with hastilly facelifted front-ends that incorporated rectangular headlights.

Kind of a replay of 1957-1958, when quad headlights started working their way onto cars."
2719	April 12, 2005 3:14PM	stickguy	"I liked these too, and they fit my HS years (late '70s). I remember looking at a used Monza around 1980 (not sure if it was before or after I grduated HS). It was silver with a V8 and stick shift. I think it had a few tweaks, and was very sharp. Pretty quick for the day, especially since I was driving a 6 cyl. Duster at the time!

Anyway, other that a smidge of rust in one rocker (iirc), it was very clean I think.

Not sure exactly why I didn't get it. Might have been too much for the budget, or the fact that my mechanic that inspected it said don't bring it back for him to work on. That's where I learned about having to jack up the engine to get to the back plugs.

Maybe there was something else wrong, but I'm getting fuzzy on the details.

Well, it was 25 years ago, but that doesn't explain why I can't remember what I did at work last week."
2720	April 12, 2005 3:33PM	michaellno	"I owned a Sunbird coupe .. it was a 1979 model year that I bought in the spring of 1982 for $3700. It only had 11,000 miles on it; the previous owners were elderly and didn't drive the car too much. 2.5L ""Iron Duke"" 4-banger with a 4 speed manual transmission. Beige with beige interior.

Drove it until the summer of '85 .. that car gave me no end of problems. I bought it when I was still in HS in CA, but a year later I moved to PHX to attend college. It hated the hot weather! I had all sorts of problems with it not wanting to start when the weather was warm ... I used my first credit card (Sears, natch) to rack up several hundred dollars in repair bills trying to figure out what was wrong.

Was involved in two accidents with that car ... the first one wasn't my fault -- a lady tried to make a left turn in front of me. Unfortunately, when the car was repaired, the shop didn't fix all the problems with it -- they never noticed the two broken motor mounts, which ultimately caused problems with the transmission. I couldn't get it into reverse.

Was on my way to the transmission shop when accident #2 occurred. The car in front of me slowed down to turn right onto a side street. I was in the process of changing lanes and taken that exact moment to look over my left shoulder to see if the lane next to me was clear. It was, but I didn't get over in time and rear-ended the car. Insurance totalled it and I got a $2000 check -- this was about 3-4 months before I was scheduled to graduate.

Overall, not a bad little car. No A/C, so I bought two sheepskin seat covers and used the 2/55 method of keeping cool. I had already installed an aftermarket sunroof while I lived in CA, so that came in handy as well.

Looking back on my experience, one other thing is interesting. It went through tires pretty quickly. When I moved to AZ from CA, I stopped in Yuma, AZ to spend some time with relatives and noticed that the front tires were pretty worn .. ended up buying 2 new Firestones.

A year or so later, I was coming back to AZ after a holiday in CA. Was doing 70-75 on I-10 just outside of PHX when the tread on the right rear tire separated from the belts .. made the most God-awful noise. In fact, the rubber that was still attached to the tire actually made a dent in the rear rocker panel! Scared the heck out of my passengers -- a classmate, my sister and her best friend. Had to drive on the worn out tire for 5 or 6 miles to get to the next town and get new tires installed again.

Ah, memories....."

We made it to the Atlanta Auto Show yesterday. Sat in a few cars that I liked. Surprisingly, I liked the Ford Freestyle and the Chrysler 300c.The Freestyle looks like it would be a great option for someone who wants a tall, non-suv, non-car type vehicle. Roomy and the build quality seems light years ahead of any Ford that was built 10 years ago.

The 300c had a great driving position and was roomy. Chrysler reliability still scares me though.

My favorite car was hands down the 2005 Acura RL. That is one sweet car. The NAV system is awesome and the seats are extremely comfortable.

Of course there were the usual $100,000 Mercedes that we can all dream about. I found out I do not like the new Bangle BMW's at all. Not even a little bit. The Legacy was OK but Gee was very uncomfortable in it. Infiniti really did improve the G35's interior making it an option again. Don't like the new GS. The Ridgeline was OK but I'm just not a truck person. The new Civic was nice. It will be interesting to see what the production versions look like.

2729	April 13, 2005 2:32PM	kyfdx	"Yeah.. when you get to Columbus, you want to take I-270 south and west to I-71 south (not I-75).. then, when you get to Cincinnati, it is east on I-275..

I'll shoot you an e-mail.."
2730	April 13, 2005 2:39PM	stickguy	"wouldn't it be quicker (and less painful) to fly out? Maybe I just don't have any friends that I want to spend 9 hours in the car with! Or, for that matter, would let drive my car for another 9.

Southwest goes from BWI to Columbus. Get a $49 fare, and then you just have to get from Columbus to Cincy (I have no idea how far that is of course). Could always rent a car and drop it at the end.

Not sure who flys into Cincydirectly or how much it would cost.

But, anything that gets a car bought for someone works for me!"
2731	April 13, 2005 2:45PM	kyfdx	"Kind of tough getting into Cincinnati.. It is Delta's second largest hub, and no one has cheap one-way fares.. Some round-trips are now reasonable, though..

Columbus is a 2-hour drive.. I'd think you'd eat up the savings with the rental car..

When I bought my car in Chicago, my wife drove me to the Dayton airport (1 hour), and I flew ATA into Midway for $114, one-way.. and the car seller picked me up at the airport..

You could check AirTran from DC to Dayton...that might be the cheapest fare..

2732	April 13, 2005 2:47PM	corvette	"Oh, yeah, I never posted my other observations from the Louisville auto show. The RL is nice, and it was parked right behind the Mercedes exhibit. The new Civic wasn't there.

The H3 has a hydraulic opener on its swing-out rear gate, and there is no way to stop it from opening completely. This sucks if you're in a tight area. Visibilty is awful, as expected.

There was a new CLS, and I distinctly remember noticing several quality problems on it, but the only one I remember is the rattling doors, just like a GM product.

The Titan's emblems are way too big.

The Tribeca's front end is every bit as ugly in person as it is in pictures. I'd like it if it weren't for that.

The one I was most impressed with was the Ridgeline. I knew I liked it when I saw all its features and creature comforts, and after seeing it in person, I like it even more. It's not the right vehicle for me, but if I had to buy a truck, that would be it. Very practical, very nice. This is a much better, more practical choice for most people who are buying Avalanches or Sport Tracs."
2733	April 13, 2005 2:51PM	jlawrence01	"If you are going to fly Southwest, you fly into Louisville (SDF) rather than Cloumbus. It is closer and generally the fares are pretty much the same. Despite the fact that my family all lives in Cincinnati, I think that I have flown into and out of that airport perhaps twice. The first time was to DCA for my first job interview. And second was on a business trip.

It is almost a cottage industry in Cincinnati to avoid the Delta monopoly but with Delta's pending bankruptcy, there is hope."
2734	April 13, 2005 2:54PM	kyfdx	"They really cut some round-trip fares after the first of the year..

Back in January, I checked roundtrips, non-stop from CVG out to CA and AZ and they were all $250-$300.. About 1/2-2/3 of what they used to be...

But, I doubt there are any cheap one-ways in to here.. If you have a sucker friend to drive your car back, that is the way I would probably go...."
2735	April 13, 2005 2:56PM	andre1969	"and the cheapest 1-way plane ticket I could find was around $300! Now I'll admit I didn't look too hard, maybe I could have found a better rate. I also checked into Amtrak. A 1-way train ticket is only about $65, but the train trip is about 13-14 hours! According to Mapquest you can drive it in about 8. And honestly, I think I'd go crazy on the train! I don't like sitting still for long periods of time, like in a plain, train, or being a passenger in a car. Driving, though, I'm fine.

Oh yeah, I even checked Greyhound. Never got as far as the fare price, because the trip takes like 24 hours! The bus goes to NYC first, and then I have to transfer twice, and I just didn't want to deal with it!

Oh, how are the police in Ohio, West VA, and that little bit of PA I'll be going through? Being out-of-state, should I pretty much stick to the speed limit, or are they usually okay if you do the flow of traffic? I'll be on the interstates for the most part, but occasionally I'll have to stop and get gas. I can get about 400 miles out of the Intrepid's tank on the highway before I start to worry, but I have a feeling that coming home with that LeMans, fill-ups are going to be a bit more frequent! Are there any little one-horse towns I should make it a point NOT to stop at? They dissolved New Rome, didn't they?

I'm not too worried about the drive, though. I've driven further, and for dumber things than this!"
2736	April 13, 2005 3:00PM	corvette	Cops in Ohio have a bad reputation, but my anecdotal experience is that I have done a couple of thousand miles in the state at or above the speed of traffic, and with out of state plates, and not gotten stopped. Here in Kentucky, my experience is that as long as there's someone going faster than you are, you're relatively safe.
2737	April 13, 2005 3:07PM	kyfdx	"As long as you are within 10 MPH of the speed limit, you are okay just about anywhere.. The only caveat would be marked construction zones... They may pop you for as little as 6 MPH over there...

I always try to stay within 25 MPH, because in my state, you can lose your license at 26 over..

Amtrak for $65?? Wow.. I'd be tempted to do that.. Of course, don't you get into town at 2 AM?

kyfdx"
2738	April 13, 2005 3:39PM	nippononly	"saw the Tribeca in person recently, and figured out what it looks like to me: a friendly alien that is wincing as it sucks on a lemon. This model might take up my vote as the year's worst-looking car from the front. Why is it Subie can never find a face that looks good? Remember all the Imprezas from 2001 on that had the huge goggle eyes? They tried to fix that early, but didn't much improve it when they did.

Car Talk's top ten ugliest cars list is now out, and number two is the xB (Aztek made number one of course), number five or so is the Element. I like the looks of those two! They easily beat Tribeca from the front. Avalanche, Magnum, and 300 all make the list too. This is a listener's call-in-and-vote list."
2739	April 13, 2005 3:45PM	anonymousposts	"and not really in the mood to clean so I checked out a few cars that peaked my interest.

I built my 300c online and with the 5.7l V8, sunroof, HIDS, and NAV the total comes to a MSRP of $37,580.

My Freestyle SEL with the safety package and DVD entertainment system totals $31,700.

My G35 sedan 6-speed manual with Premium Package A and XM Radio came up to $34,760.

Man, nice cars are getting expensive. My Accord was only $24,000 and has everything I need and most of what I want. So buying it at the end of the lease is starting to look very tempting again.

I also sat in the new Jetta. I liked it until I sat in it. There is this plastic piece that's at the base of the windshield and the dash. It's very distracting because that's what I see when I sit in the car. Maybe it's just because I'm short though."
2740	April 13, 2005 4:00PM	jaserb	"IIRC, Subaru hired Alfa Romeo's lead designer, who brought over some design themes that were very similar to what he was using at Alfa. If they had started with the Impreza it might have worked out OK, but I don't think the styling works nearly as well on a larger vehicle. The Alfa 147 is as drop dead beautiful a small car as you'll find.

2741	April 13, 2005 4:01PM	kyfdx	"I just checked...

Northwest.. one-way.. from DCA to CVG.. changing planes in Detroit.. $196. About a four hour trip altogether..

Delta, one-way.. from BWI to DAY, changing planes at CVG (where you get off and don't get back on), $141. The flight to CVG is about 1.5 hours..

Just food for thought..

regards,
kyfdx

Edit: Even better.. you can do BWI to SDF or CMH, and get off in Cincinnati for either $124 or $119... Same flight as the BWI to DAY"
2742	April 13, 2005 6:43PM	stickguy	$124 for a short hop plane trip vs. a 9 hour drive (when I have to make an immediate return trip) seems like a gimme.
2743	April 13, 2005 6:46PM	kyfdx	"Same here... Plus, his buddy would probably much rather drive him to the airport, than take a 20-hour roundtrip...

Of course, if you drive... and find out the car is not as advertised, you can just get back in your car and drive home.. The airplane thing is a little more problematic.."
2744	April 13, 2005 7:04PM	andre1969	"is starting to sound more tempting, but I'd just feel better having the comfort of knowing that, if this car ends up breaking down on me somewhere in Western MD out of range of cell phone reception, I'll have a Dodge Intrepid right behind me that I can use to go for help! And I didn't even think of the possibility of the car not being as advertised, but that can always happen, too!

Of course, now that I've said that, watch the Intrepid be the one to break down!"

Probably have to spend the night, then about $200 to fly back..

I'd think really hard about flying here... The only glitch, would be if your flight canceled, and they moved you to another flight that didn't connect in Cincinnati.. It wouldn't help much to book a flight to Louisville, if your connection was in Atlanta.. :surprise:"
2747	April 13, 2005 9:45PM	corvette	Actually, I have never been fond of the front ends of Alfas, either. The rest of the parts of their cars sure look nice, though!

Truthfully I love my truck, but I can't wait for the lease to be up, I need a bigger truck. With the truck empty and just the 4 of us in there we are just a meer 439 lbs shy of the GVWR soooooo we cannot tow our travel trailer with it since the hitch and tongue weight will throw it way over the GVWR. Pretty useless truck if ya ask me, I love it and its a blast to drive, but we can't use it for anything. Its a yard ornament most of the time.

BTW, Zippy is closing in on 9 months old and will turn 30k here in a few days. Still no problems to speak of."

2753	April 14, 2005 4:30AM	nippononly	has the pioneer CCB spirit for the rest of us right now! An eight-hour drive in a 30 year old car that you have NO experience of? That is truly brave, even if you do have a pace car. :-)
2754	April 14, 2005 4:57AM	akangl	"LOL, a Chevy 2500HD is on my short list when I finally get rid of the Titan. With our business expanding we will have to replace one of the trucks, I'm voting for the Titan to turn into a 3/4 ton or 1 ton, hubby is voting for the Ram 3500 to turn into an F-550 or bigger with a dump bed. Right now he is on a mission to buy a skidder, the money in his account is burning a hole, lol.

On another note, (to mark), yes I've driven Zippy 30k in 9 months, but keep in mind my commute is 165 miles/day round trip. Still a perfect flawless little car, kudos to Ford for making such a little critter. I do wish she was an automatic, had a/c, and cruise, but hey, she runs great, gives me no guff, and gets pretty decent fuel economy, can't complain too much I guess.

As for the Titan, its a yard ornament because nobody has time to drive it, I drive Zippy 95% of the time and hubby drives his Ram 95% of the time. The Titan goes out once a week at the most. Course we do use it for long trips and every 2 weeks to go get groceries. Its just over 5 months old and has 7700 miles on it which for us is LOW LOW LOW, 1500 of that is trips to Anchorage, the rest is probably trips to the dealer, lol. :lemon:

We normally average 3000-4000 miles per month on our family vehicle, so 7700 in 5 months is nothing."
2755	April 14, 2005 5:47AM	michaellno	"I hate to admit it, but I was thinking of trading in our Focus over the weekend. Wife had to work, so I was home alone and decided to do some errands ....

... which led me to a Saturn dealer. Looked at some '01 and '02 L-series, low miles for $10-11k, thought seriously about a straight up trade for the Focus, but decided against it.

Why? you may ask ... well, I'm jonesing to get my car back .. the '03 L300 with the V6, leather and sunroof. Daughter is still driving it, since she can't drive a stick yet. I'm hoping to teach her (or she'll learn on her own) over the summer so we can trade cars. Our office is moving closer to where I live in Aug/Sept, so my commute will be cut almost in half --- 18 miles v. 35 miles.

About the only good thing about the situation is that the miles are kept down on the L300 ... daughter has only put 2-3K on it in 4 months."
2756	April 14, 2005 1:24PM	stickguy	"how can a truck rated to tow 9,200 pounds (or so) not be able to handle a modest size travel trailer? I thought the one you bought was reasonably light weight.

Sounds like rationalization to me, and I know a lot about coming up with lame-o excuses to move into new wheels.

My Scion has a squeaky rear hatch, and developed a nasty wind whistle last night. Need to make an appointment, but these kind of noise really bug me, so if the dealer can't resolve the problems, the title may start riding around in the glove compartment (just in case)."
2757	April 14, 2005 2:19PM	robr2	"Andre - watch out for some of the tips being passed on. The idea of getting of the flight in the connecting city can create havoc for the airline and TSA. Since 9/11, the flight attendants have to count the passengers on the plane before takeoff and comapre it to the manifest. If their manifest shows you are missing, it throws up all sorts of warning sirens and may warrant a visit from the TSA. Also, before 9/11 airlines used to do the same thing but it was to allow them to charge you the fare for the flight you took, not the flight you booked. It's all on the back of the ticket.

As for not using the return flight, the same thing applies. The airline can charge you for what you booked, not what you took.

Good Luck."
2758	April 14, 2005 2:46PM	andre1969	"I've pretty much decided on driving at this point, though. Truth be told, I really don't like airplanes, anyway. It's not that I'm afraid to fly (although I do have an active imagination...haven't seen any gremlins on the wing yet though!), but I end up worrying about stupid stuff, like am I going to miss the flight, is the person who's supposed to meet me at the airport going to show up, etc. And don't even get me started on baggage...although on a trip like this I'd only have a carry-on bag at most.

I know a lot of you guys are saying ""it's and EIGHT HOUR DRIVE"", but the way I look at it, it's more like ""hey, it's ONLY and eight hour drive!"" I've driven to Chicago, Oklahoma City, Houston, and Washington State, so to me this is gonna be a cake-walk!

That's good to know, though, that hopping off the plane where I shouldn't can cause problems. Just in case I see any more cars on eBay that are far away! :shades:"

A weird thing has happened, I have Chrysler 300c-itis. It's really unexpected. But the only car I liked more than it at the auto show was the RL and the RL is $50,000. My only concern with the 300c is the Chrysler parts bin interior.

I still love my Accord though. 15,000 miles on it and she has had no problems (knock on wood). She gets 31 MPG even with my lead foot and occasional stop-and-go driving. It'll be hard to justify spending $10-$20,000 more for another car.

Yeah, that's right I have a fixation on Hyundais. I think it has been customer service, or is that I get everything I want when I want it and the price is always right. In case anyone is wondering, the two Santa Fes and the '03 Sonata I bought on the same day. The list is longer but for the last three years with money out of my pocket that's a start. By the way Currently shopping BMW, Jaguar, MB waiting to get hit, because can't seem to give up current cars."
2766	April 15, 2005 2:30AM	akangl	"Nah, not this time. Ok, here's the numbers:

The truck with the 4 of us in it (and no, we aren't THAT heavy, lol), a full tank of gas, and the hitch in the receiver weighs in at a WHOPPING 6105 lbs according to the scales. Now the SE that I had weighed in at 5900 lbs on the same scales and I foolishly assumed the LE would be similar in weight.

Ok, now the GVWR of the truck is 6499 lbs, so 6499-6105= 394 lbs for payload and tongue weight. The DRY tongue weight of the travel trailer that we bought is 494 lbs (see the problem yet??). The trailer has a dry weight of 4476 and a GVWR of 6200 lbs.

The travel trailer is an ultra light made for 1/2 ton trucks, however, the Titan has a lower GVWR than any other 1/2 ton on the market.

The Titan has a GCWR (gross combined) of 14800 lbs, so even fully loaded we are ok there. Its the GVWR that's kicking our butts. I guess we will either not tow the trailer with the Titan (hence not use it at all) or we will run overloaded (at least 500 lbs over the GVWR when all said and done).

See, I'm really not rationalizing THIS time, we really do have a major problem here."

First mistake was having her test drive it, when she wasn't sure what see wanted. She never wanted to look at another thing.

You would think that would ice me for a while. Probably will, but I'm starting to get real antsy to do something with the Scion. I knew I shouldn't have compromised, but it did get my wife her 'Ody. Just gotta get that dumb thin paid off."
2777	April 15, 2005 6:01PM	akangl	"What do to what to do............I'm at a loss. Hubby says trade the (he used different words here) darn thing in and get a real truck. (EEEKKK, is he enabling my CCB habits??)

I've got a call in to the Chevy dealer to see what they have and what they will give for my Titan. I heard a collective groan when they found out my trade would be a Titan......is that a bad sign??

I'm content to keep it and not use it to tow the TT, just drive it, but hubby says that's silly and if it stays it tows otherwise it goes.

I really don't want to give it up, honest I don't. Could my CCB habits be fading?? Could I have Titan fever?? Is it fatal?? LOL :P"

2779	April 15, 2005 6:05PM	akangl	You are getting good at this. I swear this time isn't because I want to, but we apparently (stupid me) bought too much TT for the truck. I'm inclined to just take 2 vehicles everywhere and tow the TT with the Dodge but hubby says no. He says to either deal with overloading the Titan (and hope it blows up) or trade it in and get a real truck. Think hubby doesn't like my Titan?? LOL

2784	April 15, 2005 7:34PM	stickguy	"If it was me, I would just tow the damn thing. There must be a decent cushion built in! maybe some helper spring things?

No, I don't do trucks and never tow.

Reminds me of a neighbor. They have a trailer that is pretty big (at least the size of yours from what I remember of the pictures). Certainly not a compact!. Anyway, they have an F-150 now to tow it, but for a long time, they towed it with a Cherokee (the original, not a grand). A 3,200lb. car with a 6. They even went long distance I think, like NJ to Fla.

I believe they finally blew out the rear end on the Jeep before the got the PU, but it did last a while, and wasn't particularly new.

Put your gear in the back of the trailer. Won't that lower the tongue wait// (see disclaimer above!)."

The tongue weight on the TT doesn't weigh the Titan down at all and the truck certainly doesn't struggle to tow it. I guess I just worry too much, but I was told to never go over the GVWR on the vehicle.........hubby does all the time with his Dodge, doesn't seem to bother it at all. Still, I'd hate to be the next person to get his Dodge, at 31k miles its been worked hard and I'm sure won't be a long lived truck.

We are hoping to hold out and just replace the Dodge next year with a bigger truck, then tow the TT with that."

But I live for helping people buy and certainly part of it is the rush of a new car without the exepense.

I've bought 3 cars in 4 years. Helped about 8 others in that time too.

I was a good boy until 2001. i kept the same car for 6 years.

2001: 2001 Jetta 1.8T
2003: 2003 BMW 330i
2003: 2003 Mazda Protege (will be up for sale by May 2005...itching for a convertible)
2006: As yet undecided but leaning toward 06 330i, maybe a Solstice, Z4, Miata, IS350"

2790	April 15, 2005 10:58PM	fintail	"Maybe someone can talk me out of this. I'm not a chronic car buyer per se, but there's a car tempting me, a car I don't really need.

The local Porsche dealer has had a 1999 C43 AMG sitting around for a couple months. Nobody will touch it, as people seem to be afraid of older MB, and their price was high (24K). However, it is in nice shape, one owner, all records, etc. In a local used car rag I picked up yesterday, I saw they marked it down to 18K. I am wondering if I could get it for 15K. I might go examine it in detail tomorrow.

The thing is, my current car is in great condition, it's running wonderfully, and I don't want to sell it to a non-MB person, so I would be stuck with it for awhile. I have no real reason to get rid of it...save for the safety features in the newer car, and the fact that even with its 302hp V8, it has a better MPG rating than my car. Hmmmm"
2791	April 15, 2005 11:01PM	akangl	"Maybe someone can talk me out of this.

Um, you are in the WRONG forum for that, we are enablers!!!

The only one they try to talk out of things is ME! LOL"
2792	April 15, 2005 11:11PM	andre1969	"I've been looking through the rule books, and I don't see any set-in-stone law in the CCB handbook that says you HAVE to get rid of one of your cars before getting another one! :shades: I'm not replacing anything with the '76 LeMans I'm buying on Sunday, nor do I plan on getting rid of anything anytime soon.

Of course, finding a place to put multiple cars can be a problem, and in my case, it's not like I'm actually buying high-dollar works of art here. In fact, this LeMans is probably going to be one of the more expensive of the cars I've owned! :P

Last saturday, my uncle asked me, and not with much subtlety, ""so when are you going to build a garage?"" I'm taking that as a hint that he wants my DeSoto and Catalina out of Grandmom's garage! Guess my next purchase, after the LeMans, is going to be one of these... http://hometown.aol.com/browngary/images/reuff102204a.jpg, in maybe a 30x40 foot..."
2793	April 15, 2005 11:12PM	nippononly	in fact, it sounds EXACTLY like the kind of car you should go straight out and buy! Why couldn't you have two, and alternate between them? The C43 for odd-number days (and track days?), and the 126 for even numbers?
2794	April 15, 2005 11:31PM	fintail	"Aah I forgot...I am in the wrong place.

My problem is exactly that...lack of space. I live in a condo complex. I get one nice big reserved spot. I have the fintail stored in the big garage of the locak old MB speciailst. I could park the 126 in a public spot, but it would be risky...I hate door dings. I suppose I could park it with the fintail - for a fee, of course. Three cars seems too many for a single person. And I'd feel bad about not driving it. I drive the fintail every 2 or 3 weeks when it is sunny on the weekend...and I feel bad about that, even though I am told it's OK. With the 126, I would have to halve that. And it's not like the 126 is a real collectible...it's just special to me as it is in such good shape, and is such a match for the fintail. I don't know.

I'll probably be able to talk myself out of it...the C43 is much smaller, so that will probably do it right there. Another thing is that I hate to have a car payment. If I spent 15K I'd have almost nothing left in the bank. So I would have to finance half of it anyway. Uugh.

Here's a pic of it. 302hp in a car that size, and limited production are what attract me. And it's rated at 23mpg highway, which beats the 19 my 126 is rated at (although I average 21-22)

BTW, the same lot also has an 05 E320 CDi with 20K on it (!). They want 47K for it...at least I know I won't think about it."
2795	April 15, 2005 11:49PM	ghulet	'three cars seems too many for a single person'.........talked to Andre lately? I think he's now up to, lemme think (Intrepid, Chevy truck, DeSoto, Catalina, Fury, Dart, NY'er, newest acquisition Grand LeMans, am I right?), is that eight? Of course, he has land on which to park them. :P
2796	April 15, 2005 11:58PM	akangl	That's a beautiful car, I think you should definatly buy it. Think of how badly you will kick yourself if you let it pass by.
2797	April 16, 2005 12:01AM	andre1969	"I'm down to 7 now, including the LeMans. I got rid of the Gran Fury back in November. I never thought I'd say this about an old V-8, RWD Mopar, but I don't miss it that much. Now admittedly I kinda let it go, after I bought the Intrepid. It fell into spare car status, but I'd hardly ever drive it because it cost about twice as much in fuel to drive as the Intrepid, although surprisingly on the highway it could break 20 mpg. Then it began eating starters on a regular basis, and in the same month the water pump went out and I got an emissions notice. 4 years of owning the thing, and never once did I get a notice to bring it in. I thought it was because it was a police car and exempt. After all, one reason they didn't sell these things to the public was because of the higher-performance stuff that made it guzzle and pollute more. At that point I took it off the road. I also discovered that a lot of things swap between an M-body and an R-body, so basically it was a parts car when I sold it.

BTW, anybody know what it would cost, as a ballpark figure, to rent a garage space for a car? I've thought about doing that with this LeMans for the time being, until I can get my garage/barn/whatever built. Even though it's not the most desireable car in the world, from the pics I've seen it looks like it just might be in nicer condition than any of the other cars I have. And I kinda want to keep it that way!"
2798	April 16, 2005 12:05AM	andre1969	"that little Benz is pretty sweet looking. And you're right...302 hp in a car that size sounds like it would definitely be fun! Even if it's on the small side, can you still fit in it comfortably?

As for car payments, yeah they can be evil, and it's nice to not have one...that's probably one reason that I'm keeping the 300C/Charger out of my mind...or trying to, at least! Do you have enough equity in your condo that you could take out a small HELOC on it? Most HELOCs right now are running around Prime, give or take. And sometimes they'll give you a low 6-month introductory rate. I guess second mortgages and HELOC's can be evil things too, but if used wisely they can also be fun!"
2799	April 16, 2005 1:04AM	nippononly	"I could be in trouble - a local Supra has just come on the market - 1995 model, 92K miles. It is an automatic non-turbo though, so maybe I can talk myself out of it. It looks beautiful, the owner's spiel says he has all records and it has always been garaged (which the appearance seems to bear out).

That is the year that included an SE with the ""gold leaf"" badging, which in fact this car is. It's got that ridiculously huge wing too.

fin, I don't know how you can pass that car up for a mere $15-18K. It looks gorgeous, and if as you say mechanical worries should be few, you should leap on it. You know they will bargain since they have had it so long. Three cars for one person is nothing (he said with a CCB glint in his eye!), and maybe you could get a second parking spot at your condo complex? They have a provision for that where I live, which is nice because I can keep my truck off the street too.

edit...holy crap, there is a '97 Supra in the Auto Trader today too, and that one IS a twin-turbo. Oh my, oh my. 67K miles. Says he has changed the oil every 1K miles. A touch excessive, perhaps? That is 67 oil changes already if so. ""never raced"". I may actually be salivating! :-/"
2800	April 16, 2005 1:57AM	fintail	"OK, I made the first bad step. I went and looked at it closely. I didn't drive it...as the salesman was the *only* person there aside from the receptionist, and they were closing in 10 mins. But I must say...it's in very nice shape. The interior is unmarked and the paint is very nice. It has xenons and side airbags, not to mention ESP. It was sold new at the local MB dealer and has every record. And its a V8 with AMG exhaust, so you can imagine it sounds decent. I'll have to sleep on it. If I drive it tomorrow and it checks out...I might just tender a 15Kish offer tomorrow.

I joked to the dealer that I have 2 cars and I don't know how I would handle a third...he suggested I just keep em all, like you guys. He was pretty insistent that if I sell the 126, I do it myself. I know they'd offer painfully little in trade.

I can fit in the C43 just fine...MB makes cars for taller people. It's not big like the 126 though...I could be 50% wider and 6"" taller and still fit in it. And about the HELOC...I don't know if I want to bother. I could put a third down and pay it off in no more than 2 years I am sure.

I think garage rental varies widely area. The guy I know charges me $40/month to store the fintail, and it is a handy place to store it, as I can talk him into fixing it for me if something breaks. It helps to know someone who owns a building.

I'd be tempted by those Supras too. My fave Toyota....and the only car that looks right with a huge wing."
2801	April 16, 2005 2:27AM	akangl	Fintail, sounds like you are gonna be buying that car. Come on, you know you want it!!
2802	April 16, 2005 4:06AM	lancerfixer	Since I've decided to pass on the 300E, SOMEONE needs to be gettin' a Benz this week. Might as well be you.
2803	April 16, 2005 5:48PM	fintail	Once it stops raining here, I am going to go down and probably take it for a drive. I want to test it in dry weather, you can hear more that way,
2804	April 16, 2005 10:06PM	fintail	"I took it for a drive today. The dealer went along with me at first, then let me take it out for a bit. I do like it, for the most part.

It's a lot tighter and faster than the 126. The steering wheel is smaller and it all seems much more modern. The ride is rougher, it is louder (but in a good way...V8 sounds), and the black makes it seem smaller than the light grey of the 126. I'm pretty impressed overall, lots of amenities.

My main pet peeve is the automatic wipers. They go much more often than I prefer. I wonder if they can be overridden.

I am trying to get some advice from the local MB guy on what to do with the 126. I told the dealer I would get back to him Monday or Tuesday."
2805	April 16, 2005 11:05PM	iron_cross	I just read regarding miles driven and the need to replace the cars. 17k in the first 10 months. Currently driving two cars. '03 Sonata 64,000 miles and '04 Tiburon stored over the winter still have 15,000 driven only 7 months. I figure I need to move to cut down on driving now only commute 35 miles instead of 90 or so. Save money on gas need to buy more cars with the excess. HA HA.
2806	April 17, 2005 1:26AM	ghulet	"....like Fintail said, Andre, garage spaces vary WIDELY by region. I'm guessing if you ask, say, Nippononly (who lives in SF, IIRC), spaces are probably north of $200 a month near him. Same for NYC and parts of downtown Chicago. Close to the lake, parking is generally $150-200 a month, around here I could probably get a garage space for around $100, though street parking in my 'hood is usually pretty easy.

Fintail, was the V8 on the C43 unique to that model, or was it the same engine used on the E500/S500/SL500? Just wondering how painful it would be to have repairs (in terms of both wait time and cost for parts)."
2807	April 17, 2005 1:39AM	nippononly	"oh heck, try twice that, maybe $400/month if you can even find a garage with a vacancy. Which is difficult. Downtown, people are now paying $1000/month for a reserved parking space - this is of course the rather wealthy financial district office types who commute in. Kind of makes me chuckle to think that there are many parts of the country where you can get a whole apartment for that money.

Best thing to do around here is find someone who lives in a house with a driveway (or if you are really lucky, a garage, but that is rare) that doesn't have a car themselves. They will usually rent the spot out for the kind of money you mentioned, maybe $100/month, maybe $150. Of course, that entails a lot less security for the car, and usually more exposure to the elements too. lots of rain in SF....

Oh, and forget the street parking game, most neighborhoods in the City have very little available space, and the people who play that game usually won't move their car for WEEKS if they can find a curb-side spot. Which makes me think, what then is the point in having a car?"
2808	April 17, 2005 2:29AM	akangl	"I'm looking at a Silverado 2500HD and a Suburban 2500, which would be better? The only reason I am looking at the Suburban is the rebates are much higher than the Silverado. I need all the rebates I can get!!

2809	April 17, 2005 3:34AM	corvette	"Stay away from the car lots!

...

In the alternative, GM is coming out with the GMT900 (next generation) in the 2007 model year. I hate the front-end styling on the pickups, but it looks like you can't get the diesel in the Suburban, if that's up your alley.

Are there no good deals on a Superduty?"
2810	April 17, 2005 12:00PM	andre1969	"in about 2 minutes I'll be leaving for Cincinnati to get my LeMans. I'm psyched up, but a little nervous. I watched ""Smokey and the Bandit"" to get me ready for the road trip.

I'm west-bound and down! Just as long as I don't get Smokey on my tail! Or any Texas county mounties! :shades:"
2811	April 17, 2005 12:30PM	jjtj	The 2500HD pickup is really more of a 1-ton truck, and rides pretty rough when it's unloaded. A 2500 Suburban, I believe, has not quite as firm of a suspension and would probably ride better, I think it might even have independent rear suspension? The standard 6.0L is a great engine, although the 8.1L big-block is even better for towing. I know it's an option in the 2500HD truck, pretty sure as well on a 2500 Suburban. The 8.1L will hit you up a little more at fill-up time though. If you end up with the 2500HD, look at the Duramax diesel as an option too. Much more powerful & trouble-free than the old 6.5L TD.
2812	April 17, 2005 3:08PM	fintail	"""Fintail, was the V8 on the C43 unique to that model, or was it the same engine used on the E500/S500/SL500? Just wondering how painful it would be to have repairs (in terms of both wait time and cost for parts).""

IIRC it's the same engine as in a S420/S430, but tuned to put out just over 300hp, which is the same output as a S500. Some parts are simple stock, some are special AMG. It's also a twin-spark car, so it takes 16 expensive spark plugs. Luckily they are a 100K mile part. Maintenance won't be as cheap as a normal car...but I've been driving MB for a while now, so I've become used to it. Oh, and the tires on the thing look expensive too. I did notice when I was driving it alone yesterday, some people were looking at it, esp a guy in a 90s Mustang GT. I think it sounds a lot different than what people expect to hear out of a little C class.

I've made up my mind. Tomorrow I am going to offer 16K flat. I might budge 500 or so...but that's it. I'll make the offer, say I'll write a check for 5K right now, and if they don't take it, I'll just walk....I don't *need* another car. I think I'll keep the 126, at least in the short term.

Good luck on the trip Andre. I made a couple long road trips in my fintail, so I know your car can handle it. If you get into any trouble, I hope your car doesn't change into a beat up older model, like the cars in Smokey always did..."
2813	April 17, 2005 11:14PM	nippononly	"fintail - I hope you get your price! I was looking at a '99 CLK430 yesterday that was supposedly an AMG, and it did have the AMG rims, but wasn't there any other AMG badging on these cars?

It looked really nice. It only had about 40K miles, I forget what the exact asking price was. Silver. One of the rims was marred - someone must have run it into a curb - too bad they weren't more careful. They were asking like $20 or $21K. I think it was 21. Looked really good in and out except for the huge obvious blemish on the one rim."
2814	April 18, 2005 1:02AM	fintail	"They'll either laugh at me or take the offer. Either way, I am not harmed.

The AMG CLK (CLK55) started in the 2001 model year. A 99 is just a CLK430 with some AMG add ons. You can order AMG wheels individually, as well as badging. Real AMG cars usually have distinct interiors, down to the steering wheel. They also have special exhausts which are easy to spot. There are a lot of normal cars out there with AMG badging.

The wheels were one thing I checked out on that C43. Not a scratch. IT's the same on my 126...I am very picky about wheel condition, as abused wheels can indicate a lot of potential suspension issues."
2815	April 18, 2005 1:20AM	akangl	"Not going to look at diesels, can't justify the $6k price hike when I'd be paying 30 cents more per gallon at the pump......diesels don't get THAT good of mileage!

I'm thinking either a Suburban 2500 with a 6.0 or 8.1 (preferably the 8.1) or maybe a Silverado with either engine too.

I don't like the ride of the super duties, way too rough! Chevy is the only truck I'm interested in and a Suburban is really the only other vehicle I'd want beyond my beloved Titan.

Hubby said if we can work a deal on a Burb its fine, that's what we'll come home with, then again, he'd love to see the Titan leave the stable. Its me that's the hold up, I love my truck.

I will either do it or not on Friday, if not I'll keep my Titan and hope for the best (it really does handle the TT just fine, doesn't act overloaded)."

2820	April 18, 2005 2:17AM	jjtj	I agree that the price premium is rough, but one thing to keep in mind (esp. as a CCBA member) is that the resale on Duramax trucks is very high, so you'd probably get the money back or close to it when you trade. I just love the newer diesel engines in pickups.. they're very quiet but you can still hear the turbo spinning up. Plus they come stock with 605 lb/ft of torque so it will pull just about anything. I have a Silverado 2500 w/ the 6.0L & it's a great engine too, but my next truck will most likely be a Duramax.
2821	April 18, 2005 2:21AM	akangl	Oh I know, I love diesels and the Dmax is my all time favorite, however, I just can't swing the extra $$$ right now. Plus in another year or so the Dmax Burb will be out, I've been waiting on that........yup, that will be SWEET!!!!
2822	April 18, 2005 2:52AM	mark156	"Fintail... great pics of your cars! I'm a Mercedes nut too. I had a 1991 560 SEL that I kept until Dec. of '99 when I bought my 2000 E430 sport. I would have kept the '91 longer but at 83,000 miles... it began to have problems and I needed my car to start when I would be gone for several months and come back to a dead car.. ( I had the car started weekly). The fuel injection went out and was never right after the repair.

Personally, I like cars ""VERY"" factory. I would not have changed the headlights on your '89 but if you like, that's great.

I'm in Key West for a few days and then going to Ft. Lauderdale for a few days... where does Terry live?

It would be really cool just to say hi to him.

Mark"
2823	April 18, 2005 4:13AM	fintail	"Thanks for the compliments, I appreciate it. I do love that 126, it is such a good old car. It has been reliable for me, and it is so comfortable and pleasant. It's a modern classic. I am really torn on what to do if I end up with that C43, I don't want someone to buy the 126 and run it into the ground. And on the other hand, if I keep it, I won't drive it as much as I should...I don't want it to rot away.

To me, being 'factory' would mean the car would be Euro spec. Ugly poorly conceived DOT add ons like multi-piece headlights and chunky bumpers irk me. If I could handle the work, I would like Euro bumpers on the 126 as well. That's too much of a job for me though. To me, the Euro light are what the designers intended...that is the most stock form of stock. I'm really into originality. The car still has its weird Becker Grand Prix, for example."
2824	April 18, 2005 5:37AM	nippononly	"ah, I see. Thanks for the answer. So this owner advertising his car as an 'AMG' was a little misleading then, wasn't it?

Despite all that, I was kind of surprised to see such a fast car for relatively low money with so few miles. I would almost have been tempted, but I hate marred alloys, especially huge ones like those AMG rims, and you are right, it could also indicate other damage underneath.

Plus, it was an automatic of course...with this much engine on tap, I am not sure how much that would matter, but I suspect I would still miss the control of the stick."
2825	April 18, 2005 7:11AM	andre1969	just got in around 3:00. Now I'm gonna go to bed. For about a week! :shades:
2826	April 18, 2005 1:17PM	fintail	"Yep, misleading as in he's advertising a car that doesn't exist. He'd be well advised to call it 'AMG accessories' or something, or someone might call him on it. I am sure if he sells it as a full on AMG car and then the buyer finds out that it isn't, that there'd be recourse.

The fast car for cheap is part of what tempts me on the C43. Compared to my current cars, that thing is a 4 door Ferrari. I never realized what a big grandpa car barge my 126 is.

No manual AMGs for some time...maybe some early ones had the option, but all I know of are auto. From what I know, it's a good unit though.

Andre made it....Smokey and the Bandit was on last night, made me think of those Pontiacs. I only watched it for a minute...saw the chase scene with the hood-scoop Mopar sedans and thrown in the mix was a 66 Ford. I somehow doubt those were still being used then. There are also two fintails seen in that movie."

2828	April 18, 2005 3:33PM	jjtj	"One other thing I remembered is that GM just sent out a mailer maybe a week ago.. anyways it was basically $1000 to spend on most GM models, I think only the real popular stuff was excluded like the C6, H1, etc. This was on top of your already ""best deal"". I'd give you mine but I promptly threw it out last week as I really don't need that kind of temptation right now.

Check your mail or maybe it's even something a Chevy dealer could comp you? I'd imagine there's extras floating around somewhere."
2829	April 18, 2005 6:25PM	andre1969	"well, now that I'm awake (sort of), I figure I'd give y'all a few details about my trip and the car. The trip out was pretty uneventful, perfect weather. Took just under 8 hours to get out there. It was about 520 miles, total

To be honest, the car didn't look quite as good in person as it did in the pictures (they rarely do), but I didn't see anything that scared me away. There's a little rust starting at the lower edge of the landau roof at the C-pillar, which was a common area, but it's minor enough that if I take care of it quickly, it shouldn't be a major deal. There were also a few dings and scratches here and there, but nothing too major. And you can see flaws in the paint if you get close to it, like areas where it was put on a bit too thick, got a bit of orange peel, and maybe a little bubble here and there. Inside the only real flaws were a torn driver's seat, and the panel on the dash between the windshield and the padded part was a bit warped, and wouldn't fasten down. Oh, and the clock doesn't work.

As for driving, I was actually impressed by the way this sucker handled! I was expecting something much more floaty and boat-like. And I thought looking out over that looooong hood would be intimidating. Now I've had cars that are much bigger than this thing (at 208"" it's actually kinda tiny compared to some of the monsters I've had), but from the outside this thing looks like it's all hood! The front-end slopes downward though, as do the blades on the tops of fenders. In a strange way though, it felt a bit like being behind the wheel of ""The Car"" (that classic 1977 movie about Satan's hotrod). And the thick rear roof quarters with their little opera windows don't create as much of a blind spot as one might think. The C-pillars extend pretty far back, though, and at a quick glance in the mirror, they make me think something's cruising in my blind spot. The tailfins of my '57 DeSoto do that too, to a certain degree. I guess it's just that there's part of my car in a place that I'm not used to seeing in my mirror!

The biggest handicap is probably the steering, which while responsive, is typical 70's car in its lack of feedback. It'll point you where you want to go with ease, but just doesn't give you any road feel while doing it. Now I don't know how a Pontiac 350-2bbl is supposed to perform in a car like this, but this one wasn't bad. I'm sure the shift kit in the tranny helped somewhat. It can be a bit of a shock though, when a car like this is so ready to downshift to 2nd at 70 mph, though! It also has dual exhaust, so that might have helped a bit.

Let's not talk about fuel economy, though. I figure around 15 mpg, on the highway. with 89 octane. We were doing 70-80 most of the way though, so that might've had something to do with it! I wonder if I tried some of those annoying hypermiler techniques, maybe I could get it up to over 20? I think the Intrepid was doing about 25 mpg on this trip.

But, overall, no leaks, no nasty noises, except for a loose bumper guard and A-pillar trim the seller pointed out to me. Surprisingly, this car didn't even squeak or rattle. I guess GM actually DID build one or two good ones back then! And this sucker is comfortable, too. As low slung as the car is, I'm surprised at how high up the seating position was, although part of that may be because of the power seat. It's pretty well-padded, and although todays' seats give you much better contouring to keep your butt planted in sharp cornering, it still seems to me that, for the time period at least, GM actually DID put some effort into their cars. Well, some of them at least!

Kyfdx met me at the seller's place of business, where I picked up the car. And for someone who showed up in a BMW 3-series and normally drives a CR-V, he reacted well to my little piece of 70's nostalgia! :shades: We ate at a nearby Steak & Shake. Nice place, good food. Too bad they don't have those out here. Nice meeting ya, Walt! If you're ever planning on coming out my way, give me a shout! And if I'm ever back that way, I'll do the same!"

It's in ""tinker and drive"" condition - nice enough that you can drive it without being embarassed but with a few things to play with here and there. PO has done most of the expensive stuff - engine and trans rebuilt 20k miles ago, new cloth top 3 years ago, reupholstered seats this year. Super original CA car, with only a little rust in the driver's floorpan. Everything else is rock solid. The color is called ""Canary yellow"" in English, and while I was thinking ""red"" it is really starting to grow on me. Everyone has a red Alfa, and besides - my wife loves it, hence the OK!

2840	April 18, 2005 11:32PM	fintail	Well, no C43 for me. I went to the lot after work to pitch my offer, and it had sold! Oh well, now no worries about dealing with the 126, which was running like a new car today. It would have been fun, but a lot of expense and effort. I'm not unhappy.
2841	April 19, 2005 1:30AM	ghulet	...or at least OK, to have the decision made for you in the form of the car having been sold already. Takes all the stress away, though sometimes leaving a twinge of regret in its stead!
2842	April 19, 2005 1:36AM	fintail	A little regret, yeah. The dealer was pushing me to put a deposit on it Saturday...had I, things might be different now. It would have been a fun car, although probably three times as expensive to run as the 126. They aren't unknown cars...so if I really want one, I can always go to ebay or autotrader.com etc. And my 126 gets to stay in a good home. It would have killed me to see it sitting in some local lot.

Now this guy has always liked old cars, including the 70's. His first car was a '77 Cordoba, and his second was a '78 Newport. Then he went to an '82 Cutlass Supreme sedan, a '95 Grand Marquis, and now a 2004 Crown Vic. While he's always liked old cars though, once he started getting newer ones (the Grand Marquis was only 4 when he got it), he got used to the reliability and fuss-free service that newer cars can provide. Driftracer's Dakota and Jolie's Titan excluded, of course!

Anyway, he's always liked older cars, but I figured he'd just prefer to admire them from afar, but not own one. Well, lo and behold, yesterday he called me and asked me if I could be on the lookout for a '73-74 Ford LTD!! His mother had one, and it's the first car he can remember. I wonder if whatever I have that makes me like 70's cars is catching? :P"
2846	April 19, 2005 3:18PM	andre1969	"now these things are coming out of the woodwork!

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=6424&item=4543577258

This one has the grille I like, which is vaguely reminiscent of the ""crosshair"" grille that's a Dodge hallmark nowadays. This one also has the 455. Also has a few other things that mine doesn't have, like rust in the floorboards, an exhaust system that sounds like it needs work, non-stock wheels, etc.

Strangely, it looks like it also has the same seats as my car. I would've figured a Grand LeMans would've had nicer seats than a LeMans, but maybe with this one being a ""Sport Coupe"" instead of a basic LeMans, perhaps it had an upgrade or two? It's interesting, too, how Pontiac went through the effort back then to make minor changes to the trim levels. For example, at the rear, the base LeMans just had single taillights on each side. The Sport Coupe added dummys with reflectors on the decklid. And on top of that the Grand LeMans added a metal chrome trim piece between the taillights on the decklid!

They also went through the effort to change the dashboard and steering wheel on the Grand LeMans, which used the Grand Prix dashboard, versus a different design for the cheaper LeMans models. But, one of these beasts in my zip code is enough, I guess, so I'll just admire this one from afar!"
2847	April 19, 2005 3:40PM	nippononly	"I was cruising the local Pontiac lot yesterday, and they have leftover 2004 GTOs you could get for $25K. That's not a previously owned car, it is a new car that never sold last year. 350 hp, no hood scoops. Total anonymity, in fact! :-)

Not really my cup of tea, but certainly very fast. If you are into more of a handler, I don't know that you could do any better than the RSX-S new. Now late model used is a different story...

PS I was amazed to see that the same dealer is marking new 2005 GTOs up by a whopping 7500 DOLLARS!!! Wow, I guess some people never learn."

I was extremely impressed with the drivetrain - it's smooth, tight, and fast. Suspension is great, and it has hands down the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in an Alfa - the notorious 2nd gear syncro is like butter. Best of all, it passed emissions this morning (no 30 year exception in Utah), and the only failure on safety was a burned out tail light that I'll fix this afternoon. It's a great foundation for a ""rolling restoration"" - a little tatty cosmetically with a super solid body and excellent mechanicals. All for the princely sum of $2500.

It also came with an absolute treasure trove of parts, new and used. I've got to go back up this weekend in my pickup and haul everything home. The idea is to sell the spares I've got to finance the parts I'll need to buy.

I am going to look around casually, and put the word out via the salesman at the MB dealer who sold me the 126. He still remembers me on a first name basis even when I am window shopping, and I think he could keep an eye out. I'd like to find an even nicer C43 with less mileage. If I don't find one within a year or so...I am going to maybe look at the curent (02+) C32 which should be depreciating. I saw one today and it looked pretty cool."

The C55 sure looks interesting, but way out of my price range at the moment. I am very hesitant to spend more than 20K-ish on any car...an exceptional C43 should be in that range, and the C32 will be in the upper 20s next year I bet. I guess I'm now having more regret on snoozing on that car. I at least hope the buyer didn't buy it for my lowball price. I read a lot of online discussion about the C43, and I found very few negatives about reliability...just steep maintenance. I can handle it.

This one looks right, but is overpriced IMO. If it was 20Kish and local...I might be in on it.

I've had good luck with my MB so far. The fintail is over 40 years old and about 250K on the clock now, and it is doing fine. The 126 is 16 years old and 180K, and it runs like a top. I wouldn't want anything else."

Was seriously considering pulling the trigger, BUT, I came home to think about it. Now I'm having second thoughts, I really like my Titan. I don't know what the long term effects of overloading are and when they will crop up. I mean I loved the Suburban but I love my Titan more. Ack, since when do I actually THINK about it??? LOL

2873	April 21, 2005 3:39AM	corvette	"I think the thing to be concerned about is the load rating on the tires (summer and winter). Anecdotally, my dad had two Honda Civics that were overloaded with bags of mulch or other supplies on a semi-regular basis, and they never suffered any ill effect--I would suspect that a body on frame vehicle would be even less sensitive to overloading.

I took my neighbor's Yukon for a spin, and can't believe I was actually considering buying one. Handy, but not my type of daily driver. I thought it was bland, but if it's just for utilitarian purposes, that may not matter--you still have Zippy."
2874	April 21, 2005 4:02AM	andre1969	"I loaded my '85 Silverado to the top of its bed with firewood. Now I have no idea how much that amount of wood would weigh, but my stedpad said it was easily a ton. Weeelll...the truck weighs about 4200 pounds and only has a GVWR of 5600 lb (my '76 LeMans actually has a slightly higher rating, around 5640 lb...hell, it's more of a truck than my truck is! :P )

So, I guess by the time you figure that load of wood, plus me driving, I had it up to around 6400 lb, or 800 over. I didn't have any problems, but I do think that my Grandad or stepdad put heavy duty shocks on it at one time, which might have helped a bit.

What is usually the first thing to get stressed out when you exceed the GVWR of a vehicle? Back in the old days, if you got a bigger engine, you often got a higher GVWR (for instance, a '76 LeMans 6-cyl ""only"" has a GVWR of around 5290 lb), so I would've thought that it might stress out the engine. But then nowadays, often a bigger engine won't get you a higher GVWR (for instance, a Chrysler 300 Hemi is around 4850 lb, not significantly more than a 3.5 or even a 2.7 model). So I'm wondering if nowadays, it might cause more of a structural failure, than an engine/tranny/mechanicl failure?"
2875	April 21, 2005 6:49AM	nippononly	I think you should upsize to the 6L engine - you NEED six full liters don't you? Besides isn't the 5.3 the one affected by the piston slap thing? The extra money isn't all that much, and surely the tow rating must go up with the bigger engine.
2876	April 21, 2005 12:03PM	guss	"Jolie

Just some food for thought. Why don't you see if you can have the suspension beefed up to handle the larger load.

We do that with our commercial Chevy one ton service vans at work. Takinking them up to a ton and 1/2 costs less than $1,000, but well worth it if you like the Titan so much.

However I know you are leasing , so I don't know if this would hurt you at all at turn in time."

2878	April 21, 2005 12:30PM	corvette	IIRC, the piston slap (cold start knock) was supposedly corrected in 2003 with updated piston rings more resistant to carbon buildup, and it affected the 4.8, 5.3, and 6.0 engines. Note that they are not offering to replace the piston rings of the 1999-2002 trucks that are affected.

2880	April 21, 2005 1:57PM	jjtj	"I don't think it's the frame that you need to be most worried about. If you make sure you have a ""D"" or ""E"" load rated tire, that will take care of alot of it. I'd be more worried about the braking system, transmission & suspension. Make sure to service your transmission often. I plow snow with my Silverado & do the fluid/filter swap twice per year. Way more than indicated but it really extends the life. Another thing you could do is to get a set of Timbren suspension boosters for the rear axle. They're thick, rubber springs that mount onto the axle that reduce the ""squat"" of the suspension when you load it with the hitch, etc. I use them on the front suspension of my Silverado to reduce the stress of the 800 LB snowplow cantilevered off the front end. I don't know how much, if any, they increase the GVWR, but they really reduce the amount the front drops when the plow is lifted. Plus they take alot of stress off of the control arms, ball joints, etc. They're easy to install & the front set only cost about $150 delivered. Goto www.timbrens.com.. they explain it in more detail. There's also an application chart to see if they're offered for the Titan."

Nice truck, would do what we need it to do. Had to think about it some more, although after today I do know we DEFINATLY need a bigger truck, just not sure I'm ready to part with the Titan. We can always use the Dodge and take 2 vehicles everywhere we go camping.

We took the TT to Anchorage and ran into very bad roads. We had to plow through a foot of snow, almost rolled the whole rig, I think it was only the VDC that kept the Titan moving in sort of a straight line. We got a little reprieve, hit dry pavement, then 60 mph winds. The poor Titan was getting tossed all over the road by the wind sail behind it, that was with the WD setup and anti-sway bar.

By the time we got the TT to the RV dealer the wood paneling had come off the fridge door, part of the dinette was broken, and another drawer had fallen out and broken. Good thing its all warranty, lol."

They are one of the better looking trucks around and we once wanted to put one in our driveway but the various horror stories around Edmunds knocked us back to reality.

If the deal is good on the Yukon and you might think about possibly considering maybe thinking about probably keeping it a for a couple of years it might be worth it to get out of the lease on a vehicle that will be out of warranty by the time the lease ends. I wouldn't have much faith at all in the ability of the Titan to hold up especially with your driving conditions."

Nine weeks until my lease is up, although I will probably be moved out by the end of May... I'm excited to be moving into a nicer and cheaper place (the cheaper part comes from having roomates).

2902	April 23, 2005 10:23PM	anonymousposts	"Gee just mentioned looking at a beagle. I looked them up and read that they need lots of room to play (we have an acre total will have 1/2 fenced if we decide to get a puppy) and they will start barking if they feel they are being neglected. They need lots of attention and exercise. Otherwise they are a great dog.

Gee has always loved Huskies but I'm not sure how one would act around my son. That's why the Golden Retriever seemed like such a good idea. Anybody in here have experience with small children and dogs?

To keep this on-topic ... I saw an ad for the 05 Kia Sportage. It's not that bad. Seems like it would be a good deal once you can get one for around $13,000 for a base model. I would need something to drive the puppy around in. And it would be cheap and allow me to keep the Accord while Gee gets his Lexus and probably keeps his old Lexus (aka ""The Spider Condo"")"

Sounds fair to me! I don't think there will be any pets in the new place, but if there are, they won't be pounding on someone's roof, and I would at least get the benefit of their company.

My parents' neighbors have a beagle (I've dog-sat for them before), although theirs is rather rotund because she doesn't like to run around. Very friendly, and seems to do fine when left alone, although there is at least one other dog and a cat around.

I have thought about holding out for the Dmax Burb, but it will be 3 years I figure before prices level out and bugs get worked out. The 2007 Burb and Dmax Burb come out in spring 2006. So, that means either I keep the Titan and ride out the lease for the next 3 years (and hope for the best) or I bite the bullet, take the loss and dump it for the Yukon XL.

It's easier to hang on to the leased cars because there is already a predefined time when we will be replacing them. For all of you who are CCB looking for a way out, I recommend leasing your car. Besides, who can beat getting a new car every 2-3 years wihtout buttloads of negative equity?

2941	April 28, 2005 2:56AM	stickguy	"The A3 is very enticing, although I also like the V50 (you may sense a pattern here). Actually, the IS250 might get a look.

The big problem is the cost. I don't want a second payment (we already pay on the '05 Ody, and the tC was a cash deal). Actually, one of the reasons I got the tC because it was so much cheaper than my other choices, we were able to get the wifes van too. Live and learn.

Well, I thought it might be a s/t selection. Right now, it is still worth quite a bit relative to what I paid for it, so a viable trade/sell candidate. But, unless I go way used (like that spider condo), I would do a new lease.

Sell the tC, pay off the van, and lease something nice, and be paying less overall monthly. Sure I won't own a tC 3 years from now, but I'll never keep it that long anyway.

Just need the right subsidized lease. Volvo has had some attractive ones (but you never see a V50 T-5 stick). If Audi tossed out a intro killer lease deal, that would do the trick.

The tC is OK, but not really all that practical with 2 kids, and it is a bit cramped for me. SOmething with a bit more room for me, rear doors, and better seats (plus some extra goodies to play with) might keep me happy for a while."

2947	April 29, 2005 1:43AM	racer63	"I'll add to the chorus of those sorry to see Drifty go. Our paths probably have crossed at an autocross or two over the years. He did mention a potential move out west, but if Mathias can post from Der Faderland, there has to be internet in Montana or Idaho or somewhere like that too.

As for me, that new job that came with the non-accountable plan car allowance is keeping me hopping, so absolutely no time to goof-off during the day, and usually my bee-hind is so kicked at night I don't feel like typing anything.

Speaking of that car allowance, and how miled up my Celica is getting on it, the answer is not much. Previous job was an 18 mile 1-way commute, and occassional trips and meetings here and there. Also a bunch of weeks where it sat in a parking garage at the airport while I was on work related travel. New job is 9 or 10 miles 1-way, with some work stuff really close to home, with some other things spread out all over NJ, which at least ain't all that big. The end result is that after 4 months, I'll have racked up a grand total of 5,000 miles, exactly the mileage pace I was on previously without any allowance, and probably only getting about $50 in per mile reimbusement on average monthly. Oh, and I get gas paid for as well, though at my 29 mpg's on regular they're getting off really easy. It's still going to be a bit of a tax PITA, but it still ends up money in my pocket, and I don't have to drive a Malibu, which was the company car that went with my position prior to them instituting the car allowance program.

My latest car fantasy is actually rather cheap and practical, figuring in that above allowance, tax implications and almost 100% work use. One of them great deals on Accord leases. I really haven't tried to find a 4 door 4 cyl EX-L 5 speed. I assume it'd be a rather rare bird, but probably well under $300/month to lease for 36/45k. Something to debate with the Mrs. I'll hear in response that we just got a new crew cab GMC last summer, and I did get my new race trailer a month ago, and the backyard landscaping needs to be finshed, and this, and that......

Oh, and I'm already hard at work warping and molding the CCBA youth auxiliary. :P The soon to be 9 year old wants a truck, preferably a Dodge Quadcab Cummins, and a RSX-S, and lusts after an Enzo."

My dad will fly down with me to the BMW Performance Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina to take delivery of the car...

Now, there is something I have no experience with: Getting plane tickets (probably) on short notice, without paying an arm and a leg. I will try Priceline, but are there any other tips?

It is only a six-hour drive from Lexington.. For $600, I'd drive it, if your father is up to it. I checked all of the prices on Expedia...

On another note, I stopped by the dealer today to look at them.. I really like the Sparkling Graphite... Only other colors they had were Arctic and Black..

I think you'll be glad you got the sport package... the stock 325i still has 16"" wheels, and the 330i next to it with the 17"" looked much better....

Is the Sparkling Graphite like the Silver Gray on the 2005 model? The Arctic looked interesting in the photos, plus I'd suspect it will be a relatively uncommon color.

I told you I know nothing about this scheduling a flight stuff, I thought when I ran a quote on Priceline for two passengers, the price it gave me was for both, not per passenger! Have you considered starting a travel agency?"

Driving down there is easy... We go right by on the trip to Hilton Head... I can make it in 6.5 hours from here, near Cincinnati..

I bought the 3-series in Chicago.. Saw it on Ebay.. It only had 7600 miles.. I actually did the deal over the phone.. gave the guy a $1000 deposit check, which he said I could have back if the car wasn't as advertised when I got there.

I contacted two others that had bought BMWs from him within the prior 2 months, one of them local to me, before I made the deal. Both had rave reviews, no problems.. My wife ran me up to Dayton, and the seller picked me up at the airport in Chicago.. One hour later, I was on my way back home..

Not bad... left the house at 1:00 PM for the airport, arrived home at 11:00 PM with a new car..

If the car hadn't been perfect, I would have gone right back to the airport.. I might have been out a whole day and $500, but I obviously expected everything to go as planned, and it did. Don't try this at home, kids

My GTO was out of service 35 days in 2 1/2 months of ownership. That's when I got GM to pull the plug and exchange my car (though that was another 2 month journey). Maybe this is the avenue that will get you out from under this vehicle, assuming the problems continue...

The plan was for her to ultimately learn how to drive a stick, then we would switch cars.

This is looking less and less likely -- her learning to drive stick, that is. So, I'm thinking about trading in the Focus for a comparable vehicle that has an auto tranny. Currently have 36 payments of just over $300/mo .. I know this puts me upside down, but I figure if I keep the budget between $7-10K, I should be able to keep the terms about the same. The deal is, mom and I make the payment and pay for maintenance, daughter pays for insurance and gas.

Been looking on-line all morning for late model cars (preferrably 4-doors) with auto and ABS. Turns out that ABS is much harder to find that I would have thought --- either that, or the dealers I've been looking at on-line don't always mention it."
2972	May 2, 2005 5:22PM	PF_Flyer	"Not that we'e thinking of having a car available for our 16 year old whenever she wants it, but the wife and I WERE talking yesterday about the kind of car we want her to start with. Since both our vehicles are stick and that's what she learned on, there's no problem with her having a manual. In fact, we decided that we want her to continue driving stick because you have to pay more attention to your driving with the stick. Theoretically it should be tougher to be behind the wheel and yacking with a friend at the same time.

The kid's a VERY good driver and I don't expect we'll have this kind of problem, but anything that keeps her attention focused on the task of driving is a good thing.

2973	May 2, 2005 8:47PM	corvette	"ABS was standard on nearly every GM car until 2001 or so... Tauruses that have it often have a small ""ABS"" sticker in the drivers' window. Accord EX's have had it since 1994, and Civic EX's since 1996 (I think)... Many dealers list it on the used car spec sheet whether the car has it or not. Find an empty stretch of road or parking lot and test it out for yourself to be sure the car you're looking at has it (and it's working properly). You can sometimes see the ABS pump under the hood, so that may eliminate some candidates."
2974	May 2, 2005 10:06PM	michaellno	"Yep, your last couple of suggestions pretty much hit the nail on the head ... check under the hood for the ABS pump and test it out.

Have also been pricing Saturn ION 1's, just to see. Base model with ABS, A/C, automatic and AM/FM/CD player runs about $14,5-15K. If I were to stretch the payments out over 48 months instead of 36 and throw in the current incentives, I might be able to get the payment around that magical $300/mo mark.

Of course, the daughter really wants a Mini ... ouch! Priced one on mini.com -- bare bones model with the CVT, metallic paint (she wants silver) and CD player, came to something like $18K.

Further, that INCLUDES shipping! IIRC, the 300 starts at around $23,995, with only a 2.7/4-speed automatic, no ABS, and I think you have to add shipping. Does that sound right?

Michaell, in Chicago, Ford commercials are advertising 'free' automatic transmissions on all Focus models, though I suspect if that were the case near you and you checked inventories, you'd run into the same problem....ABS will likely only be found on fully loaded models. I just checked Bert Weinman Ford's website (bwford.com), not only did they mention the 'free' automatic, but also $2000 cash back!

OTOH, ABS/traction control comes as a combo on the ION 1. Granted, we'd be giving up PW, cruise, keyless remote when compared to the Focus.

Decisions, decisions. May have to go drive the ION, just to see if the kid might like it.

EDIT: andre, keep thinking about that $347 and change you are saving every month. What? You're not saving it? You're using it to fund thrice-weekly pizza and beer nights with the buds? I know, this advice is contrarian to the stated goals of this discussion (""trade early and often""). Sorry, just thinking about the day when I won't have 3 car payments. Saturn is half done (31 payments left), while the Focus has, I believe, 35 or so payments left."
2988	May 3, 2005 2:51PM	andre1969	"actually I DO think of that $347.66 a month that I'm not paying anymore for the Intrepid. Lessee, as of May 21, it'll be 6 months of payments that I haven't had to make! :-) So basically, that's about 2/3 of that LeMans I just bought!

Besides, I'm sure any new car that I want is going to have a higher monthly payment than what the Trep was. I got 0.9% for 60 months when I bought the Trep, and I don't think they're to the point that they're letting Chargers and 300C's go for that, just yet!

And so far, I've been pretty lucky on the car repair front. I had the Trep in to get its back brakes done a month or so ago. I think that was around $200. Also changed its oil (it's due for it again). Had to change the alternator belt on the pickup. And the windshield wipers quit working on the NYer (thank God for Rain-X! :surprise: )

Plus, something else just came up, that I think I might want more than a new car. My next-door neighbor is thinking about selling off her back 2/3 acre. On the other side of her, a developer just bought up 4 1/4 acres and is going to build some houses. I'm sure he'd be interested in this land, too. So if I can swing it (and the county lets her parcel off her land like that), I'm going to try to snatch it up myself. I'd rather it stay the way it is, mostly woods but with a nice clearing, than have another house or two go up on it, right up against my property!"
2989	May 3, 2005 2:54PM	asafonov	"My latest car fantasy is actually rather cheap and practical, figuring in that above allowance, tax implications and almost 100% work use. One of them great deals on Accord leases.

You know, I looked at these (LX sedan w/auto), as I was debating whether or not I did the right thing by buying one two years ago - need a minivan soon. I see the advertised payment of 199/mo + tax for 36 months, and the drive-off costs of between 2k and 3k. That's roughly between 9.5k and 10.5k outlay for 3 years. Assuming that a new 05 LX can be bought for about 20k OTD, these leases do not sound as a great bargain, since I suppose a 3-year old Accord LX w/ under 36k miles is worth more than 10k - certainly on a private sale, not sure about a trade-in.

The lease may be a better deal on the higher-end model (EX-L) you mentioned... and since you want a 5-speed, I would definitely lease rather than buy."
2990	May 4, 2005 12:43AM	anonymousposts	"michaell: Have you considered a Scion? You can get a xA for $13,000. Standard with ABS, power options, AC, etc. It could kind of be considered a more reliable, albeit less cool, Mini. I remember you saying you wanted ABS, automatic, and AC. Might be a good fit.

Another option might even be a Hyundai. Reliability seems much improved and you can't beat the deals that you can get on them right now. $14,000 for a Sonata is a pretty good deal considering you get ABS, side airbags, power everything, and a mightly long warranty.

On the used car front I would probably go with a used Altima between 98-01, a 99-01 Protege, or a 98-00 Civic EX."
2991	May 4, 2005 12:45AM	anonymousposts	The advertised lease is usually based on a price that is close to MSRP. When I was helping a friend buy a car we calculated that a 05 Accord LX with a sale price of $18,000 would lease for $200 a month before taxes. And that was with nothing down .
2992	May 4, 2005 1:25AM	corvette	Good ideas. The xB might also be in the running. The Sonata would be similar in size to what she's currently driving.
2993	May 4, 2005 2:35AM	akangl	"Pretty much what the service advisor at the Ford dealer said about it when he ran the Oasis report. He said to run, not walk, away from that truck, he said no way he was gonna let Nissan pawn me off on Ford with something like that, lol. I trust him 150%, have known him for 14 years. He's the ONLY one I deal with at the Ford dealer as far as service goes. Course he says I don't visit much........hey, can't blame Zippy for being such a good car!!

Speaking of Zippy, she will make her final visit for a very minor repair and a general checkup on Monday. She will be out of the B2B warranty within 4k miles (so about a month). Still the best car I've ever owned!!"
2994	May 4, 2005 2:42AM	corvette	Sound ominous... Does Zippy have an extended warranty, or will the first out-of-warranty repair be an excuse to trade her in?
2995	May 4, 2005 2:54AM	akangl	"Sound ominous... Does Zippy have an extended warranty, or will the first out-of-warranty repair be an excuse to trade her in?

LOL, actually Zippy came with a 5 year/100k powertrain warranty in addition to her B2B warranty. I can't see anything really going wrong with the car, its been pretty flawless so far. Zippy will hit 40k miles before her first birthday, poor little car.

I wouldn't trade her in, my goal is to have her paid off by next spring.......course she'll be closing in on the end of her powertrain warranty by then so I hope she's paid off!! I think we will keep her for a long time, will make a good first car for my son who is getting way to close to driving age for my liking!!"

There are beginning to be other things that we want to put our money into. We want a boat. We also have a nice size unfinished basement that, if finished, would be a great place for all of big Gee's and little Gee's toys."

Hehehe, I'll be keeping Zippy until she reaches 100k too, but that's only about 18 months away at the rate the miles are packing on, will turn 32k tomorrow. Would like to keep her for my son's first car, so once she's paid off she will probably stay in the family barring any major changes in said family, lol.

Not sure how long the Ram will stick around, have had it for 18 months now, only has 31k on it."
3002	May 7, 2005 12:33AM	anonymousposts	"I saw a Sun Ray Sundeck model in one of our car books and thought that would be a nice boat. Then I looked them up and saw how much they cost. We haven't looked at any specific models yet but we would want a nice family boat. Something that will get us around a lake safely and comfortably. Saw a boat for sale down the street for $3500 but I couldn't tell you what kind it was because they sold it before we could look at it.

As a side note, the Ridgeline did win it's comparison test against the Tacoma, Dakota, Colorado, and Frontier.

akangl: We have 70,000 miles (3 years) and 85,000 miles (4 years) left with the Accord if we keep them until 100,000 miles. One good thing is that I am one promotion away from getting a company demo. That will probably save us lots of money in the long run.

One thing in your Focus' favor is that it's a pretty base model. Less stuff to break. Where you live that's probably a good thing. Maybe that's why you are having so many problems with the Titan. The Titan would probably be fine for cruising up and down the main strip at night and hauling small loads from Home Depot. But with your driving conditions and the travel trailer you are probably stressing out it's capabilities for a fairly new full-size truck.

michaell: Why not lease your daughter a larger, nicer car? It doesn't seem as if she drives a lot. Might be the best way to get a safe car for a low monthly payment. Think Camry, Altima, Accord. You could lease an Accord LX for $200 a month right now. ABS, side curtain airbags, and a Best Pick rating by the IIHS. Also gets 34 MPG in highway driving and would cost nothing for repairs if you do a 3 year/36,000 mile lease."
3003	May 7, 2005 1:12AM	corvette	"***But with your driving conditions and the travel trailer...***

Terry says that even down in Florida, without all the cold weather and such, they're breaking stuff left and right with moderate payloads and towing--exactly like you said, anything other than a small load. Bummer...

One of the reasons I ordered my car with a stick is that I know that, should I decide to keep it a long time, I will be less likely to have a transmission failure. Liking driving a stick doesn't hurt, either! Clutch failure, maybe, but wear on the clutch should be reduced because it has a hill-start/hill-holder feature."
3004	May 7, 2005 3:26AM	akangl	"May be a brat otherwise, but it ROCKS offroad. Its covered in mud today, ran down the logging road. First comment hubby made about it was its very nimble offroad. That truck is so cool, handles the mud, rough road, and anything else we tossed at it with ease. Had the A/C on, CD player cranked, and were riding in comfort. The VDC kept it going in a straight line even in the worst of the mud.

It turned 9000 miles today and is so far being pretty good lately, except for the stuff it went in for the other day.. Time will tell this summer, have 2 big trips planned, both about 1000 miles round trip with the travel trailer.

As for Zippy, I too believe that being a base model works out very well. Not too much to break, excellent car even after 32k miles."

Terry."
3006	May 7, 2005 2:56PM	anonymousposts	It was a Searay. I looked at the price tag and pushed it from memory. Too much $$$ for our uses. I didn't really look at them in person. I just saw the ad in the magazine and searched for one online. They were going for between $14,000-$20,000 on ebay. This might not be a good way to get an idea of price though. We will get more serious about it when our Odyssey lease is over.
3007	May 7, 2005 6:41PM	danf1	and I know this is the wrong place to do it, but somebody tell me not to. I leased a 2005 CTS in november. I was buried in my TT at the time and needed to get out of it fast because a new baby was coming. Three kids don't fit in a two seater. I settled for an automatic because we didn't have any sticks at the time. I hate automatics. I like nothing in a car that thinks its smarter than me. I'm considering dumping this lease and getting a six speed now. I would be much happier with a six speed. My payment will actually come down abut $25 per month. But now I have another four years to go instead of the 42 months left on the current one. Help please.
3008	May 7, 2005 6:59PM	corvette	Your payment will go down? That's like free money, as long as you aren't putting any money down. Are you coming here looking for a reason not to? Go for it, you'll be happier...
3009	May 7, 2005 7:06PM	danf1	No money down, just 1st payment and plates.
3010	May 7, 2005 9:43PM	stickguy	"Since you are only extending the term 6 months on a lease. You will need something to drive for that time anyway.

Lets see, $25*42 = $1050, so that will cover what, 2 payments? So you are only extending 4 months (with 2 free).

I would do it in a heart beat just to get back to a stick, if you miss it that much, but I might be biased (notice the name...)

Really, in the scheme of financial craziness, this doesn't even rate a mention."
3011	May 8, 2005 3:56AM	anonymousposts	but then again we are the people who traded a perfectly fine 04 Accord EX-L automatic for a 2004 Accord EX-L manual transmission. So we may be the wrong place to come for a voice of reason to talk you out of it.
3012	May 8, 2005 4:39AM	kyfdx	"Nearby Lincoln-Mercury dealer has a '90 BMW 325i.. Only 75K... That got me interested enough to go see it.. Took my 11-year-old son with me...

2-door coupe, electric metal sunroof, calypso red (dark red..kind of burgundy/rust... something like that). Tan interior...not sure if its leather or leatherette, but no rips, stains or tears...carpets all look good... It really looked like a 75K car...

Drove it.... A/C worked okay, not great... Engine pulled strong.. typical crappy BMW clutch and shifter, but nothing out of the ordinary.. A little jittery and sloppy in the front end, but way better than you would expect a 15 year old car to be... And, the owners manual had a book full of service stamps.. Looks like the car spent at least it's first 12 years in Little Rock... Last service stamp was about a year ago.. None of the idiot lights were on... Power windows worked, etc..

But, it wasn't a 325is... So none of the sport package goodies (deeper air dam, nicer wheels, etc.)..

They started out advertising it at $7995, had it advertised in the paper today for $5995, but of course the salesman looks at his sheet and says ""$6995"".. I told him I would have to sleep on it, and run it by the wife.. :surprise:

Anyway, I did exactly that.. which pretty much ended my notion that it was in the realm of possiblity.. You'd think with both me and my son whining.... but, no....

Anyway, if the lottery ticket comes through tonight, I'm going back to get it... That and the yellow Ferrari they had in the showroom.."

3017	May 8, 2005 4:06PM	corvette	If it's leather in good condition in a 15 year old car, it's had very good care taken of it. Hold out for a 325is, you could probably find one in the classifieds, although I'm guessing your wife might veto that as well.

A nice 325is usually is out of my price range... If this one had been a 325is, in this kind of shape, it would have never been traded..... They could have probably seen $7K-$8K on a private sale...

anon ... you are correct, the daughter doesn't drive too much .. it's about 8-10 miles r/t to her high school, and probably about 10 miles r/t to her job, which she only works 2 or 3 days a week. She's been driving the L300 regularly since December and has put, I think, 3-4K on it.

A lease would work from a payment perspective, but we want her to have the vehicle after it's paid for. She's got one more year of HS left, but we aren't sure yet about college, so the miles may start to pile up."

Do dealers understand how tacky this looks? I understand the costs involved of printing up a box of 500 or 1000 business cards, but. to me, it is an indication of the sales person turnover at that dealership.

Heck, anybody with a PC and some basic graphing software can produce business cards in about 10-15 minutes - no, they wouldn't look spectacular in terms of the dealer logo and stuff, but it has to be better than somebody scratching out one sales person's name and hand writing another -- with poor penmanship, I might add."
3034	May 9, 2005 6:42PM	corvette	"A lot of dealers carry ""blank"" cards with no name and only the dealer number and website on them, for new salespeople to write their names on, so no scratching out of names... My guess is that by the time the ordered business cards come in, the new salesperson has already quit!

Some auto manufacturers don't want other brands sold on the same floor as theirs. GM has been threatening to do this for years, but I know of one Nissan-Cadillac-Chevrolet dealer. It's difficult for them to unilaterally change their dealer agreements. If Lincoln-Mercury forbade it, the dealership probably got their walking papers. The Maserati dealership will probably be more lucrative anyway!"

michaell: Before I would spend $17,000 on a Saturn Ion have you though about one of those new Altimas for $15,700-ish? Or what about a $15,900 Camry? Even a Mazda6, IMO, would be a better option than the Ion. What about a used car? You may be able to score a used ES300, Camry, Maxima, etc for the price of that new Ion. Not to knock the Ion if that's what you WANT but there seem to be better choices in your price range.

That green Benz is a manual tranny though .. that's got to be worth at least a couple of grand right?

3053	May 10, 2005 4:08PM	michaellno	"On one level I agree with your choices; on the other hand, the wife is stating that any car the daughter drives will have the following:

ABS/Traction control
Keyless remote

which, if I'm not mistaken, is tough to find on those 'loss leader' Altimas and Camrys.

One other advantage of the Saturn is the lower insurance rates. Even though she drives the Saturn, she is actually 'rated' on the Focus (insurance agent tells us it costs less per month than the Saturn), and it's still $153/mo! This is for a kid with a 3.9 GPA and has been to a state certified driving school.

OTOH, our 18 year old son, who has accumulated 2 or 3 speeding tickets and has had one accident in his almost 3 years behind the wheel, is paying $199/mo for his 2001 Saturn L200.

This is one of the major reasons I've been looking at Saturns ... either new or used."
3054	May 10, 2005 5:38PM	corvette	"I'm a big fan of ABS, but I'm not convinced that traction control will help prevent accidents, even for a young driver. (Stability control will.) It will help you get going in the snow (or rain), but in a FWD car, it's easy to tell when the wheels are spinning, and all you have to do to regain steering is let off the gas--no fancy pedal modulation involved.

I like the Accord LX for the same money, which lacks traction control but adds side airbags."

3056	May 10, 2005 6:17PM	michaellno	"I agree with you on both points ... traction control isn't for accident avoidance, but rather for the nasty weather we get in Colorado.

For example, the high in Denver is expected to be 80 today, but a front is coming in tonight that might just bring an inch or two of snow tomorrow!

The L300 the daughter is currently driving has TC, and I know it's kicked in on her a number of times this past winter. Now, it's getting to be rain/hail/t-storm season, so the TC still comes in handy.

I guess if your guys are busy selling used cars, you could afford to have them selling the Maserati also, but I would think the investment in parts and service personnel would be awfully high to do less than 50 units per year...

But, Woeste is a decent sized dealer group... I guess he would know better than I... they have been there at least one year, because they have been at the last two auto shows in February..."

I installed XM in my Maxima on Friday. Took 15 minutes. Delphi Roady2, $99, and you can mail-in for a free one. Ran the antenna, tucked the remainder away, ran the power, clipped the Roady to an air vent, and ta-da, sat radio (the install is pretty darn clean, if I do say so myself!).

That said, is it really worth spending thousands of dollars just to get a sunroof? I mean, I once traded in a brand new car 7 months after purchase because I was bored with it (hence my lurking the CCBA forums :P ), but if you're otherwise happy with a vehicle why trade it in for the exact same thing. Everyone I know that has done this (Honda Accord, Pontiac Grand Prix), traded their car <2 years because, you guessed it, they were tired of it already.

3087	May 15, 2005 8:14PM	corvette	I haven't noticed any major vibrations in the Canyon. You will feel it if the pavement is rippled, and I think the brake rotors are warping (they're too small for a truck, just like the Sonoma's were). Dad's old Sierra had a very, very slight vibration that drove him nuts (didn't bother me), and proved to be unfixable. I am a little more tolerant of NVH problems in trucks than cars--it's a truck, not a Town Car... The Canyon is improved but still does not ride as well as a full-size truck. The regular cab also has a humongous blind spot on the driver's side. And, the stock tires are cheap junk, which may be the source of the vibrations. Ours seem to be balanced fine. It's almost due for its annual service, so we'll see if that changes when they are rotated.

They had a snapshot attached and it actually looked to be in very nice shape. It was a copper color with factory wheel covers & whitewall tires. Looked like something an old lady bought new 30 yrs ago and kept in the garage the whole time. Anyways, card said ""runs great, new brakes, $500 OBO"". I looked at the photo for a couple of minutes trying to find the catch and the only thing I think I saw was a small rust spot on the rocker panel behind the front fender. But hard to tell from just one picture. The paint looked very shiny & the whole thing looked original. Plus it's in Ohio so you should be familiar with the drive. If I remember you're from the DC area.. I used to drive to that area alot from here (NE Ohio) & it took about 6 hours, maybe 7 if traffic was bad. If you're interested let me know & I'll grab the info for you. I'd buy it myself if I had a place to put it."

(Trivia bonus to anyone who recognizes where the pictures came from...)"
3093	May 17, 2005 2:22AM	fintail	"I'll take a minty fresh C43 sure...so long as it doesn't have a black and white interior, and it has xenons. I've talked to every MB dealer and most upper end used car lots within 100 miles of here...they all have told me good luck, I'll need it.

That's a toughie...it's certainly a W108/W109 from the late 60s/very early 70s. The 108 is the 250 and 280 series, the 109 the 300. It's really hard to tell which it is, given the angle, but I am guessing a 108, it just doesn't look so big. A good timeframe to guess is 68-70, when most sales seemed to take place. The most common model is a 280SE, so that's my guess. They were made in 6cyl, 3.5 V8, and 4.5 V8 models.

It could also be a 250S/SE, and there was also a 280S on the SWB platform. For the LWB cars, it could be a 280SEL or 300SEL, although I recall the 300 series cars being more chromey.

As an interesting aside, the 108 was the first platform where MB extensively tested airbags, mainly from 1969-on. They didn't hit production until the 126 in 1980 though."

Sounds like it might be a nice car, but I'd better lay off, or my yard is going to end up looking like that scene from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", or ""Wrong Turn"" where the inbreds had stashed all the cars of their victims!

For $500 though, I guess that does make you wonder what might be wrong with it! Also, it could have anything from a tiny 105 hp 231 V-6 on up to a 200 hp or so 455 V-8, so engine size can make a big diffference. I'm guessing most of them were 350 V-8's, which could have been from Chevy, Pontiac, Buick, or Olds. It's not commonly known, because all the hoopla over the engine swapping didn't come out until people started complaining about their '77 Delta 88's with Chevy 350's, but GM had started doing engine swapping before that. There was also a Chevy 250 inline 6, but I think in '76 that was used mainly in the Malibu and LeMans. And there was a tiny Olds 260 V-8, but I think that was mainly a LeMans and Cutlass thang. Then there was the Chevy 305, which I think went mainly in Malibus and LeManses. However, I guess it's possible that any of these engines could have found their way into the Regal. Pontiac was also still building a 400 V-8, but I think it mainly stayed in the Pontiac family.

IMO, a 350 is the MINIMUM a car like this should have had! By that time they were down to like 160-170 hp, so anything less to move around two tons of car just ain't right! :surprise:"
3097	May 17, 2005 1:12PM	fintail	"A column shift would point it to being earlier in the production, I think...a pre-1970 car. The later cars I see all have a funny thin-levered floor shift. But the head restraints point to it being later, so I could be wrong.

Those cars are a bargain on the market, along with fintails. A mere 5K should be able to land a person a very nice example, and show quality ones won't go higher than 10 most of the time, unless it is exceptionally nice or a 6.3."

I really don't have a whole lot of interest in 70's full size cars except for the fact that that's when I was a kid (born in 1971) so I remember all those cars from back then. My cousin & I were obsessed with cars & that's all we talked about. We could name a car at night just by the headlight pattern. Our favorite pasttime was going to a used car lot by our grandma's house & trying to determine model years by the numbers molded into the tail light lens. My favorite movie back then (& still) is Smokey & the Bandit. I must have seen it at least 50 times.. not to go off on that tangent, but if you get ""AMC"" on cable, they show movies sometimes where they roll background info about the movie at the bottom.. kind of like the old ""Pop-Up Videos"". They did one on Smokey a few months ago & it was really interesting. Check it out if you ever see it on. Oh well, I better get back to 2005.. my 1 year old daughter is yelling for me. Gotta finish showing her how to do an oil change"

LOL - my brother and I used to do the same thing!! I do remember being in middle school (late 70's) and every year I'd buy some paperback guide to all the new cars and I remember they had invoice prices even back then. I'd actually keep a notebook with a page devoted to each car spec'd and priced exactly how I would want them!!

No wonder my wife puts the big L up on her forehead when she looks at me occassionally!!"

of course, I didn't need the help."
3107	May 17, 2005 6:17PM	andre1969	"I did the same thing. In fact, get me and a few of my friends in the car back then, and we could easily piss off any adult that happened to be driving, as we named every blessed car that we drove past!

And, I have to admit, ""Smokey and the Bandit"" is one of my favorite movies, too! I caught it on AMC a few times, but unfortunately haven't seen the ""pop up video"" version. And the version I saw was EXTREMELY editted. I guess you can't even say ""Tick Turd"" on tv. Can you say it on Edmunds? :P

When I was a kid, there were two movies that I made my family take me to the theatre to see twice. The first was a minor cult classic called ""Star Wars"". The second was ""Smokey and the Bandit""! One of the few advantages of having divorced parents is that you can have Dad take you to the movie, and then have Mom take you back to see the same one! Can't remember which one I talked into taking me back the 3rd time though...might've been my Granddad.

I think ""Smokey and the Bandit"" was also the movie that got me to really like the '76-77 Pontiac LeMans. At the time my Mom had a '75 LeMans coupe, and I hated that thing! But the way I loved the '76-77, you'd almost think it was a totally different car!

As for the taillight lens trick, one thing that sucks about new cars where they don't change them every year, is that if the taillight design gets carried over, they don't change the year on them. My '00 Intrepid has ""98"" on it. I guess on the plus side though, if I break one of those taillights, any '98-04 could be a donor, instead of the old days, when you usually had to find the exact model year."
3108	May 17, 2005 8:02PM	bumpy	...after watching Smokey and the Bandit, what did you like after watching Dazed and Confused?
3109	May 17, 2005 8:30PM	andre1969	"was that the one with the line ""Well, it's obvious that the 70's are going to suck! Hopefully the 80's will be better!"" Or something like that? I remember a movie that came out around 1994 that had that line in the trailer, and remembered wanting to see it, but never got around to it.

Why, what kind of car did they tear the roof off of in that movie? :P"
3110	May 17, 2005 8:50PM	jjtj	My Uncle John actually took us to see Smokey.. and to keep it on-topic, I think I inherited the CCBA gene from him. We were talking over mother's day weekend, and he has quite a list of cars (plus a few motorcycles). I remember growing up he always seemed to have a different car and this was a really cool thing to us. He told me his list and I tried to convince him to join the CCBA club.. among his entries is a 1978 AMC Pacer wagon.. I distinctly remember this one. It was yellow with woodgrain sides & it was the extended version. I told him that the fact he was one of the few who actually purchased a Pacer new would probably get him into the CCBA VIP room or at least earn him instant Platinum status.
3111	May 17, 2005 10:08PM	bumpy	Yep, that's the one. When the kids weren't busy indulging in illegal substances, they were riding around in what looks like a '57-'73 classic car show.

3113	May 17, 2005 11:44PM	ghulet	"....although after about 1977 or so (when cars stopped changing taillights, etc every year), it became less accurate to find out what model year a car was by looking at the 'SAE Guide __' on the taillights. In any case, glad to know (as if I didn't already) that I'm among the geekiest of car geeks, from waaay back.

Andre, wondering if that movie you quoted from is '1969'? The thing is, the term 'sucks' as used in that context didn't exist in the '60s, or even '70s, as far as I know (I was born in 1969, and nobody bothered to use even slightly delicate language around me when I was a kid). I seem to remember that materializing in the early '80s. I hate a faux pas like that almost as much as seeing a '79 car in a movie supposedly set in '76. :P"
3114	May 18, 2005 1:32AM	andre1969	"sounds like a movie I'm going to get the roomie to add to his Netflicks queue. ""1969"" is another one I've never seen, although I've heard about it. I remember one of my buddies talking about it years ago, and mentioning that there were a lot of out-of-period cars in it. And yeah, I tend to hate that kind of stuff, too! I remember ""LaVerne and Shirley"" started irritating me after they moved to Cali, because it was like they weren't even TRYING to act like they were living in the 60's by that time! Same with the later episodes of ""Happy Days"".

As for the word ""sucks"", you might be right on that, Ghulet. I don't think I really started picking up bad words until I was around 7. Incidentally, right around the time that ""Smokey and the Bandit"" came out! :blush: But honestly back then, most of the ""unmentionable"" humor in ""Smokey and the Bandit"" probably went right over my head, just like all the little double entendres that they threw at us kids the first time ""Three's Company"" was aired! For some reason, I do remember using it in the late 70's, but that could just be my mind playing tricks on me. One thing I DO remember though, is in 6th grade (1981-82), when I went to a private Episcopalean school (public schools around here turned REAL bad around the dawn of the 80's), we were using the word ""Sucks"" so much, that they started docking us 5 minutes of recess time every time one of us used it! That and ""Shut Up!"" :surprise:

It's also a word that my grandmother has always hated, so maybe she remembers a time when it might have made the rounds before? Like when my Mom and uncle and their generation were kids? Y'know how we tend to be as kids...as soon as we discover something, we think we're the first ones that ever did it. Anyway, I think Grandmom hates the word ""sucks"" even more than she hates the ""F-word""...no wonder they never had any Ford products in the driveway! :shades:

Oh, yeah, on a note similar to Stickguy's, my Intrepid is also making a squeaking sound, from the left front wheel. Usually happens during a right turn, when I get to about the 1-2 o'clock position on the steering wheel. Also, it's probably time for a new battery soon (5 1/2 years). We're going to Florida at the end of the month...wonder if it's time to trade and get a new car for the trip?"
3115	May 18, 2005 4:23PM	mark156	"I guess I have to be counted in the ""Tail Light"" group. My brothers and I would go to the used car lots and check the years on the tail lights. I learned to shift a manual transmission on my sister's new 1963 Plymouth Valiant coupe... 3 speed on the column. I was only five years old but, she worked the pedals and I moved the lever. You have to start somewhere!

In grade school, sometime around 1967 or so, we went on a school field trip where the parents drove their cars to the event. I was lucky to get in a 1964 Chrysler Imperial sedan..... what a boat!

As a kid, I wanted Dad to get a car with power windows. I thought they were the coolest thing. When we got our brand spanking new 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser wagon, we had a rear power window on the tailgate....the others were roll ups. Mom and Dad didn't want us to choke ourselves in the windows.

So, since 1981, every car I've owned has had power windows/locks and since 1984, a sunroof. Some things you just gotta have!

I think Nissan ""got it in gear"" after last year's quality survey. The JD Power ones are due out any day, that will be a better indicator. My folks bought an '04 Quest and they had some problems with it, but Nissan took care of them.

My '03 Maxima is still humming along just fine, but that Grand Prix GXP (with the V8) is awfully tempting... :P"
3117	May 18, 2005 7:30PM	jjtj	"That's funny about the power windows/locks thing.. I used to think the same thing. They were so rare back then in anything except luxury type cars. I used to call them ""automatic"" windows. Back in 1980, my dad bought a 1979 Lincoln Mark V (no he wasn't in the mafia). To a 9 year old that's obsessed with cars, this was a pretty big deal.. it had power everything plus he used to let me work the cruise control buttons on the steering wheel. The doors had to be 6 feet long on that thing.. they were so big I remember that the ashtrays for the back seat passengers were on the back of the front doors (it was a 2-door). And it had a cool power antenna lever under the dash. We lived in Columbus (OH) in a pretty nice area and he must've gotten the hubcaps stolen 3 or 4 times during the time he owned it. It had these Lincoln wire wheel covers that were like $100 each even back then."

I think they did too. 2004 was a horrible year for Nissan, I'm sure they don't want to repeat that. A LOT of 2004 Titan, Armada, and Quest owners had vehicles repurchased by Nissan. I'm still contemplating mine, will make a decision after tomorrow. If we have the same transmission problems towing that we have had in the past then I'll chase after Nissan for a buyback. I really like the truck and its being very good lately. Sure is a blast to drive!"
3119	May 18, 2005 7:48PM	andre1969	"I can remember riding in with power windows/locks was my neighbors' '69-70 Caddy Sedan DeVille. It was a dark, but still bright, blue with a white vinyl top. That sucker just screamed opulence! They traded it for a 1980-81 Citation, of all cars!

1985 was the year that power windows came to my more immediate family. That year my grandparents on my Dad's side bought a new LTD (the small, Fairmont-based one), and on my Mom's side, they bought an '85 LeSabre Limited and an '85 Silverado, both with power windows/locks.

I didn't get a car with power windows until 1992, when I bought a '69 Bonneville from my cousin for $400. That's about what it was worth, too! Ate starters on a regular basis, had body damage, and was an awful greenish-gold. It was a 4-door hardtop, and it was really cool to watch all 4 of those windows drop down at once.

My uncle bought an '88 LeBaron turbo coupe in 1990, which he sold to me in 1995 when I got married. It was actually pretty nice, for a K-car! Then, in 1998 I bought an '89 Gran Fury ex-police car with power windows. After that, I ended up getting the LeSabre and pickup handed down to me, bought the Intrepid, bought a '79 NYer, and now my '76 LeMans, and all of them have had power windows. I guess, from here on out, most of my cars will have 'em, unless I get something else that's old.

You almost need power windows nowadays though, because it just seems like the crank windows don't operate as fast as they used to. With all the plastic and tape that they started using, to save on costs and weight, they ""gear"" them so you can't crank them down or up as quickly. I guess if you could, you'd probably put too much pressure on the system and break something!"

3125	May 18, 2005 9:48PM	andre1969	"out of the reaction of this one girl at work (and I guess you're getting old when you call a 24-year old a ""girl"" :surprise: ) when I took her for a spin in my '76 LeMans. She was even noticing little things, like the buckles in the seats, which were just there for a styling, and possibly to brand you on hot summer days! ""Ooh, what are those for?"" she squealed, almost excitedly! And I think just seeing a car with a red interior kinda shocked her, as she's been raised on the blah taupes, grays, and puttys of modern cars. And the chrome. And the ""Oh Jeezus"" handle on the dash, kinda like what a lot of sporty cars had back in the 60's. And seeing a pull-switch for a headlight knob, and windshield wipers on the dash, of all places! And just seeing a car that was this BIG, yet only a 2-door. The bench seat was a bit of a shock for her, too!

I thought it was kinda funny, but I guess a '76 LeMans would be just as much of an obscure curiosity to a typical 24 year old of today as something like a Studebaker or Hudson or Edsel would be to someone my age. Well, at least, someone my age who hasn't been into cars their whole life!

She's also never ridden in a convertible with the top down, so I had to promise her that I'd let her know the next time I drove my Catalina to work! :shades:"

3127	May 18, 2005 10:35PM	bumpy	Handcrank windows these days are at least as fast as power windows, even if you take your time. Tricky part is that the Accent, Rio, and Aveo are literally the only cars sold in the US that have a handcrank, so most people don't have anything to compare their power windows with.
3128	May 18, 2005 11:14PM	nippononly	not true, not true, many cars' base models come without power windows, including the Corolla and the Celica, until they just took it off the market. And the Echo, not that you will ever see another Echo on a dealer's lot. A popular car that sells well with window cranks is the Civic DX. I have tried the Celica's and the Civic's - they both feel totally flimsy and take about eight full winds to get the windows down on those little cars. Certainly, the power equivalent is a lot faster to lower or raise the window on those two models.
3129	May 19, 2005 1:19AM	ghulet	....lots of cars still have crank windows on their base models, and most pickup trucks, you just don't see too many.

I couldn't figure out what she meant, because, while it was well-equipped for a Dart, it was still fairly basic. Turns out one of the ""gadgets"" was a back window that rolled down. She wasn't accustomed to two-door cars that had that feature. I think she was also shocked that it rolled all the way down. She had an Escort, and its back windows only went down about half way.

One of my friends used to have a '78 Newport, and one day one of his nephews or some other kid rolled down one of the back windows. When the chrome strip that separates the front window from the back window went down with it, the kid started freaking out. I guess he thought he broke the B-pillar or something. Needless to say, hardtops were before this kid's time! I wonder how many people nowadays would even know what a hardtop is?"

anony........yes it is hard on vehicles, but I am very critical since Zippy has been amazing even though she was never properly winterized and was asked to go out at 56 below zero.

I was driving down a busy 4-laner the other day & saw a Kia Sedona minivan pulling what had to be at least a 22', maybe longer, travel trailer. It was pulled off the side of the road but I'm not sure it was broken down. That would take a tremendous leap of faith in my book to hook any trailer up to a Kia minivan. I don't know what those vans are rated to tow, but with FWD & a smaller V6, I can't imagine it being much more than 2000 lbs?

The Honda 2000s is sorta high strung and costly. Chevy has axed the Camaro, at least for now. The Nissan 240sx is no more. The Monte Carlo is a coupe, but hardly a sports or sporty car. Guess we have the Mustang running alone? OK, maybe a few other FWD cars, like the Eclipse. New one looks pretty wild for 2006 model. A BMW 3 is pretty expensive, even used considering BMW parts. Maybe a used Corvette, or CTS? Ah, one longs for a return of the cars like the Nova and Fairlane, or a Barracuda, or Duster. Where have all the good RWD cars with sporty flair gone. Mostly same old looking econo bar of soap styled FWD cars now. I guess the Altima looks kinda cool for the money. But it is a knock-off of the Passat. Heck, maybe an Eclipse or a Tiburon are the last smaller sporty cars left other than a Stang, and they are getting larger. Kinda like the '98 or even the '99 better in some ways. As for retro cars, I don't know, as mixed feelings have me more prone to want the real deal and get the 1968 Mustang and go for the chrome. My mind is taxed now just tying to think of anything in a sporty coupe, with a stick, good gas mileage, RWD if possible, and not costly? Hummmm? Even the FWD sporty Japan cars are getting down to the few, if any.... Must we all drive 4dr. jelly bean cars with auto transmissions, and electronic everything on board?

I did think somewhat hard about using that $1355 and trading Zippy in on an 05 Focus ZX5 auto, a/c, cruise. However, it seemed cheaper in the long run to just buy the ESC.

BTW, Zippy is just over 10 months old and has 34,220 (or so) miles on her."

Well, considering I drive 820 miles/week I want the peace of mind with Zippy. Not that she's a bad car (ha, far from it) but things happen when you get into the 80k-90k range.

As for the Titan, well, its been 4k miles since anything bad has happened, I'm hoping the major stuff is done. Has a powertrain warranty to 60k, I cancelled the overpriced (and rediculous) ESC on that."

Gonna be a shame if we end up trading it in later this year so that my daughter can drive a car with an auto tranny and I can get my L300 back.

An old school friend of mine in CA (an anti-CCBer if there is such a thing) told me he bought a new (used) car recently. In the 25 years we've had our licenses, I think he's had only 2 cars .. he started off inheriting his folks' '78 Chevette. 4-door hatch, brown, auto tranny. He drove it into the ground, then in '94 or '95 he bought a mid 80's Honda CRX - 5 speed, silver, no FI. He kept it in one piece all these years and then he just bought ....

... a 1994 Infiniti J30. A guy he works with had a second child and the Infiniti was too small for the family. All I know is that it's dark green, has over 100K on it, and my friend put in an $1100 timing belt. He says everything works, so I'll keep my fingers crossed for him. He's keeping the Honda, BTW, since the Infiniti has an appetite for premium fuel and doesn't get quite the MPG the CRX does."

3188	May 24, 2005 2:59PM	andre1969	were also anti-CCBers. They had bought the DeSoto in '59 from a Pontiac dealer. First owner was a businessman who usually traded every two years. Well, in '66 they bought a '64 Catalina, but kept the DeSoto around because the wife liked it. Then they went from that to a 1981 Buick Century, which they still had when I bought the car in 1990. I know the wife passed away about a year after I bought it, and he probably went not too much later, as they were pretty elderly. I don't think I could even imagine making do with only THREE cars over the course of 31+ years! :surprise:
3189	May 24, 2005 4:07PM	gee35coupe	"I don't' know why I can't make myself sell it. But I love that car. Everytime I look at it it gives me that special feeling. It's kinda ""special"" too. It's immaculate. It's an anniversary edition. And it's mine.

For a 1994 it looks like a new car really. There's nothing out there that I could buy right now that could replace it. At least not that I want to afford."
3190	May 24, 2005 4:52PM	stickguy	all good reasons to keep it, but only if you are going to use it. Keeping it in the garage seems to be a waste. Put that bad boy into circulation. It's better for a car to be used regularly anyway.

mid 80's Honda CRX - 5 speed
My dad had one of the first ones. White with no A/C. It wasn't an option when they first came out because the car had something like 55 horsepower. I think it was available as a dealer add-on later. But, it would get 55 MPG at 55 MPH, which kind of makes the Insight less impressive. He later bought a 1990 CRX Si, which he still considers one of the best cars he's ever owned.

I love the shape of the J30 and the first-generation Altima.

Jolie:
Sounds like the Focus will not need an extended warranty, but if anything can go wrong with it, it will happen in your climate. My best friend has a 2000 Focus which recently had a brake leak from the rear wheel cylinders. Not sure how that happened, but I blame it on her sister who ran over something a year or so ago and damaged $1000 or so in suspension components.

gee:
I agree with stickguy. Is the battery still charged? Are the tires flat-spotted yet from sitting there so long? I like buying low-mileage cars, but it also makes me think that the previous owner never got to enjoy it. I decided not to lease for the same reason."
3192	May 24, 2005 9:56PM	scanty	apart from being the same color, has the same lump that my 300ZX has (VG30DE), and my timing belt jobs run in the $800 range at the dealer, including the water pump and tensioners. I've got about 125k on mine, and other than a bad fuel injector, it's been bulletproof. Sounds like he's got many miles of happy motoring ahead.

But a man is entitled to his toys and I have to respect that ... I guess.

The tires are actually faring pretty well and Gee bought a battery tender to keep the battery charged. The only real expense associated with it is insurance which is $500 every 6 months."

Stickguy , I was at the Mercedes dealer yesterday (not buying, just dropping the ML500 off because it was leaking windshield washer fluid) and there was an older guy there and we started chatting while we were waiting for the service guy to finish with another customer.

This guy was telling me that he was bringing in his mother's 1998 Mercedes C280 in for service because it had been two years since it was serviced. Looking at this guy, I was thinking he was looking a little old himself... all I can say is, he is lucky to still have his Mom and Dad around!

Anyway, the little Mercedes was smoke silver with parchment hides with only 15,000 miles.... perfect little car to have as an extra! These are the cars that are far and few between! I have and extra garage space, only if it was for sale!

3202	May 25, 2005 3:19PM	andre1969	they'll get it up pretty quickly. And it has a 25 year warranty, so hopefully it'll stay up for a long, long time! Plus, if I decide that it's not big enough for my desires, it's always easy to add an attachment at a later date, should the need arise. :shades:

Actually, not sure if my wife wants to fill up the back yard with one. Oh well, better not ask her first!

Either that, or move up to New Hampshire and get a place in the country."
3204	May 25, 2005 3:45PM	andre1969	"the one I'm getting is around $21,500. That's with no electricity, though. 30x40 feet, stairs to the loft, 2 9x7 doors, one side entry door, and 5 windows. T-111 siding and an asphalt shingle roof with a ridge vent. That's the erected price, but also doesn't include the floor. With these types of buildings you can just build them with a dirt floor, and then go and add the concrete later, which is what I'm planning to do.

I figure that on the side without the staircase, I'll park the DeSoto and the NYer, one behind the other, and on the shorter side, with the stairs, I'll park the Catalina and the LeMans.

I also have an old 1-car garage on my property, but it was built ages ago before the property was split off. The side with the doors (it had double doors that opened out, instead of an overhead door) actually opens out onto the neighbor's driveway. Well, years later the people in my house got into it with the people next door. I guess that's what happens when you have family living next door to each other! Uncle Henry (the guy next door) wouldn't let Uncle Luther (the guy who built my house) use the driveway anymore to get his car in and out, so then Uncle Luther built a lean-to, actually attached to the house, that extended out to the property line, out of spite. I've never seen any pics of it, and it got torn down years before I was born, but I imagine it looked pretty ugly. Plus, to get into it you would've had to maneuver your car around on the road and back in...unless you wanted to back out on to the road, and the way traffic flies through here these days, that would be deadly. I don't even park my car on that side of the house anymore, because it's just too much hassle to get in and out.

Anyway, the garage also isn't that big, only about 10x17 feet on the original part, with an extension on the side that brings it out to around 20 feet. It was built back when cars were kinda tall, but not all that long or wide, and when cars still had running boards, so they didn't need that much room to open up a door. Over time, the neighbors also built their driveway up, so you really couldn't get into it from that way, anyway. I've been thinking about trying to go into it from the other end, and maybe tear off the extension and bring it out a few feet more properly. If nothing else, that would get me another garage space. But then I might be better off just tearing the thing down and buying another garage. I think I could probably have a pre-fabricated 1-car garage trucked in for like $4,000, and it would be around 12x24 feet."

I dunno, that little car is spendy to fix. A girl I work with bought (AGAINST my advice) a 2000 Focus (I told her to go for an 03 or 04) and the ignition froze on it at 40k miles (she only had it a week or two). Cost her over $300 to get it fixed.

My son has his heart set on Zippy, he loves that little car, has been begging me to let him drive it for months. In 2 years Zippy will be at the 80k mark, I am hoping to have her paid off by next spring and hang on to her for a while, saving the monthly car payment."

3207	May 26, 2005 12:49PM	andre1969	"I remember overhearing a conversation between two girls on the school bus, about a friend of theirs who wanted a Porsche on her 16th birthday. Evidently she whined and whined about it, and was SOOOOO sure that her parents were going to get her one. Well, the parents cleaned up the garage and made it spotless, and right in the middle of the floor, parked a little radio-controlled 911!

It made the poor little princess turn to tears. Hearing the girls talk about it though, you'd think that the parents were evil ogres that should have been reported to Child Services or something!

Heck, I was happy just to get a car when I got my license! And my Mom did do me a really big favor when that time got near. In the fall of '86, she bought a brand-new leftover Monte Carlo, so that I could have her 1980 Malibu when I got my license, which I got at the beginning of 1987. If it weren't for that, she probably would've driven the Malibu a few more years. So, while that Malibu might've only been worth $1-2,000 at the time, I figured in the long run that car cost Mom around $14,000!"
3208	May 26, 2005 3:25PM	nippononly	"my parents made me BUY their old car from them in 1985 when I turned 16. I had already been working for a year and had saved the money. A 10-year-old Corolla wagon! Yikes. Served me faithfully until 1991 though, having accumulated over 200K miles by then. Never needed any repairs until the day it coughed up a lung in the driveway, and had to be towed to the scrapyard. Got $15 for it. :-)

By then I already had a revolving fleet of three or four cars at a time. My addiction had taken root!"
3209	May 26, 2005 3:27PM	kyfdx	I didn't get a car until I was a year out of high school... Even then, I had to buy it myself... $650.. and really wasn't worth half of that..
3210	May 26, 2005 3:43PM	nippononly	well, I was working, so my parents figured they should help me get a car. They did so by offering me the DISCOUNTED price of $1000 for their old car! Not sure what the discount was there, it already had about 140K at the time. But they also let me go on their insurance and pay them my share, which saved me some $$ over getting my own policy.
3211	May 26, 2005 3:50PM	andre1969	"because over the years I've gotten a few family cast-offs. Things came full-circle in early 1998 when my Mom gave me the Monte that she had originally bought so I could have the Malibu. It was a great car, but only lasted 3 months/13,000 miles under my ownership. I got t-boned delivering pizzas one warm June night, and that was the end of it.

In early 1999, Grandmom couldn't pass the eye test anymore, so she couldn't get her license renewed. She gave me her '85 LeSabre. She had offered to give me this car on several occasions before, which looking back I can see was a VERY blatant hint that she was getting ready to give up driving. In retrospect I should've taken this car instead of buying my '89 Gran Fury. It was more comfy and got better fuel economy, but the cop motor did make the Plymouth more fun to drive. I don't know WHY, exactly, I didn't accept the car that summer instead of buying the Plymouth. Stubbornness I guess. Plus, I don't think I realized just how bad Grandmom's eyesight was getting, and had no idea she'd be off the road in about half a year, anyway. It would've saved me a few thousand bucks though, had I done that! And when you figure I ended up getting her Buick, anyway!

In late 2002, my Mom sold me her '85 Silverado, after she bought a new F-150. She sold it to me for $1200, and I'm sure it was worth a lot more than that. Before selling it to me, they had it advertised for something like $3500, but I have no idea what it would've actually gone for.

When I got married in 1995, my uncle sold us his '88 LeBaron turbo coupe for $2K. He had paid $10K for it in 1990, but just never really warmed up to it. He bought it for fuel economy, but has always been a truck guy. And since he always had a truck too, the LeBaron didn't get used much.

I dunno if I'll be getting anymore family cast-offs anytime soon, though. My Mom & stepdad's daily driver, a '99 Altima, is still running well at over 150,000 miles (tranny did go out at 35K, but the replacement has been fine), but they intend to drive it till it drops dead. And besides that, I just never liked that car. Too ugly, too small (at this point I still considered them compacts), and just not very comfortable. They also have a '98 Expedition that probably has 40K miles or less on it. They'll probably keep it forever, but even if they decided to sell, I'm sure it'll never be a giveway car like some of those others ended up being. Plus, it's just not something I'd ever want. And their new F-150 doesn't get driven that much, so it'll probably last for years.

Last year, I did come close to getting my Granddad's '94 Taurus. Granddad was about to turn 90, and decided to give up driving. His insurance was something like $1200+ per year, and he just didn't think it was worth it for as little as he drives. My Dad lives with him, and takes him just about anywhere he wants to go. Well, they would've given me the Taurus, and at first I said yes. After all hey, it's a free car! But then, the more I thought about it, I changed my mind. Free or not, it would still have to be tagged and titled, inspected, insured, maintained, and repaired periodically. And I just wouldn't feel right turning around and selling a car that a family member had given to me, and making a profit. In the end, one of my cousins, who really needed it more than I do, took it, so it found a happy home. Plus, I think the day my name went on the title of an F-word would be the day Hell froze over! :P"

While Mom gave me her Malibu, the flip side was that I had to get my own insurance policy, instead of being listed on my parents'. I still remember that first bill...$1,361.00 for one year. Might not sound too hideous today, but for a 17 year old in 1987 making all of like $3.75 per hour, it sure was a big chunk!

Anyways, they knew some people down around Cincy that collected 240's. I was 15 & my stepdad decided it would be a good first car.. so we drove down, picked it up & drove it all the way back. It was like a dark green color, I hesitate to call it BRG but it was ugly whatever the color. It had a 4-speed stick, inline-6 with sidedraft carbs. It had a fake wood steering wheel too. It needed some work but it was a blast to drive. MPG's sucked, but IIRC gas was about .79 a gallon in 1987. They ended up getting a divorce a few years later but the good memories end up pushing out the bad. He used to take me to work with him when I was about 13, I think.. he worked in the oil business & he used to have to check on the wells. They were always at the end of a dirt road that was usually packed with mud. He had a Toyota Land Cruiser (FJ-40), the kind that looks like a Jeep.. anyways, one day he pulls over & says ""change places with me"". I think it was a 4-spd stick, & I had no idea how to drive a stick. He throws it into 4WD & off we go. It still puts a smile on my face thinking about it. I had that thing sideways through a huge mud pit.. next thing he did was let me drive on the actual paved roads.. it was a small town & I remember rolling past the chief of police.. I was scared s***less but he just waved as we went by. It was a very small town with not much traffic so I guess it was a good place to learn. At least I knew how to work the clutch in the 240Z when I turned 16!"
3217	May 27, 2005 4:08AM	akangl	"Will get Zippy as his first car IF he gets a job and pays for insurance (or at least part of it), gas, and keeps his grades up. Zippy won't come without strict rules.......break them and Zippy becomes MINE again. Stick to the rules and Zippy will be signed over to him when he graduates. I'm sure Zippy will still be around, she is truely an amazing car. My next Focus will go to my daughter with the same restrictions.

We just got back from Anchorage, the Titan was awesome, no problems, turned in decent fuel economy considering hubby's leadfoot.

Looks like my daughter will get into the Nutropin study, but not sure if she will get the drug yet or not (its a growth hormone). This is good news for us and her, especially if she gets the drug. She is doing pretty good all things considered.

Oh and my first car........my husband bought it for me 2 months before (April 1993) we were married. My parents wouldn't even teach me to drive, I had never driven a car before in my life. I was 17, learned to drive on a 1990 Nissan Stanza XE that my hubby bought me. Got my license on June 1, 1993, got married June 12, 1993. Still married to the same guy, but the car is LONG gone, lol. :P"
3218	May 27, 2005 4:21AM	corvette	One of my friends has one of these, and it is affectionately called the crampmobile due to its lack of interior space... He was considering a Jetta (about the same size inside), but the Altima has given him 130,000 troublefree miles (the Jetta wouldn't have). The 2002 and newer Altimas are truly midsize cars. Mine was really good to me, and I still recommend them for that reason.
3219	May 27, 2005 12:03PM	andre1969	"I test drove an '02 Altima back in March of '02, and really liked it. If I wasn't so upside-down on my Intrepid at the time, I think I might have actually been tempted to make the switch! This one was an S model, in kind of a sage green with a beige interior. They had two greens back then, but the other one had a slightly more bluish tint to it.

One thing I really like about the current Altima is how far the front seat goes back. I swear it has to be about one of the roomiest cars on the market these days, when it comes to legroom! And even with the seat all the way back, I could still fit in the back. Compared to my Intrepid, the Altima felt like it was narrower inside, but still roomy enough for my needs. There were a few things I didn't like about it, like the quality of some of the plastics, the style/quality of the dashboard, and the engine sounded really coarse and thrashy at idle and lower speeds, although it was so quiet at highway speeds it was almost unnerving! Still, none of those issues were bad enough to turn me off to the car, but just merely showed that no car is perfect in every respect!

I think it was EPA-rated at 23/29, so it probably would've gotten better economy in most of my driving than my Intrepid, which was 20/29. And in acceleration, just going by the seat of my pants feel, they felt about the same. I guess the newer models with a 5-speed automatic would be even better.

If I didn't have my heart set on a Charger one day, I'd definitely consider an Altima the next time around. I like 'em even better with the '05 facelift."
3220	May 27, 2005 12:39PM	anonymousposts	"""Car of the Day"" last week was a 2005 Altima SE-R 6-speed. A lot of bang for the buck. We priced it at an MSRP of $30,500 or so and could get one for $26,500. Not bad at all."
3221	May 27, 2005 1:46PM	michaellno	"Lessee, the first car that was mine (as opposed to driving whatever my parents had), was a '65 VW Bug with the Baja kit - this was when I was 16 or 17 (1979-1980). I think my folks paid $1500 for it. White, 6-volt electrics. Hated that car ... was constantly breaking down on me. Stranded me once on the highway at midnight coming home from my girlfriends house -- had to call the parents to come fetch me. Stranded me another time in Solvang (anyone see the movie ""Sideways""?) - which is about 2 hours from where I lived. It got handed down to my sister, at which point my dad, uncle and cousin spent a weekend converting it to a 12-volt system -- she never had a problem!

The first car that I bought was a 1979 Pontiac Sunbird coupe in the spring of 1982. Paid $3800 for it. Car was beige, had the 2.5 ""Iron Duke"" 4 banger and a 4 speed transmission. Car ran fine while I lived in CA; I moved to Phoenix a year later to attend college and that car hated the hot weather. Ultimately, it was totalled in an accident about 4 months before I graduated.

Regarding the Altima - I was seriously looking at them when I bought my Saturn. Like Andre, the interior room was pretty phoenomenal .. and the 4 cylinder engine put out quite a bit of power. I think I've mentioned this before ... loved the outside, hated the inside. For some reason, the orange lighting on the dash bugged me, and the quality of the interior plastics just turned me off. Plus, I had my heart set on a V6 with leather and sunroof, which, at the time, was running about $27K or so on the Altima. So, I bought the L300 instead for $24K and got 0% financing to boot."
3222	May 27, 2005 2:47PM	kyfdx	This really upsets me... I'd like to have this car now..
3223	May 27, 2005 3:00PM	jaserb	"Bought it for $300 or so in 1992. Some pretty bad rust was starting, but it was a nasty shade of brown that hid the rust pretty well. I never could get it to pass inspection mostly due to an exhaust leak. A $50 manifold probably would have fixed it but I was 16 and broke. Ended up selling it to a guy who put a Ferrari lookalike kit on it.
The first car I actually got that was licensed and legal was an '82 Camaro, with oxidized black paint and a bad engine. My dad and I swapped in a junkyard engine - the almighty 2.8 V6 - and I was rolling. For a while, anyway - till the tincan TH200 tranny crapped out. I had it rebuilt, then it went out 2 more times under warranty. After the third rebuild the tranny shop let me know they were through working on this car under warranty, so I decided it was time for it to go. I ended up with another 260Z, blue this time. Had a love/hate relationship with that car that lasted for the next 8 years.

-Jason"
3224	May 27, 2005 3:12PM	danf1	was a 1987 Chevy Sprint. What eventually was called the Geo Metro. It was a horrible little thing. 3 cylinder engine, 5 speed manual, no air, no power steering, and it had a 6 gallon gas tank. I picked it up for $500 in 1993 and managed to keep it on the road for two years. It did teach me how to fix things though, so it wasn't all bad. I had the windshield wipers die on me, so my fix was to tie 20lb fishing line to them and run the line inside to operate the wipers manually. I replaced two clutches, one set of shocks, and brakes seemed to go about every 10,000 miles. But I was 16 when I bought it, and it was dirt cheap to run around because it didn't use gas. I think I got about 45 mpg out of it.
3225	May 27, 2005 6:08PM	perna	"1983 Pontiac 6000, it was a hand-me-down from my grandma that I started driving in 1991. Cruddy 4 banger, power steering was shot (making it more difficult to steer than if it didn't have power steering in the first place), *nasty* brown paint and interior. But, it was comfortable and was reliable. Until the engine blew up cruising down the freeway (there was literally a hole in the front of the engine block.. threw a rod maybe? dunno), that was the end of that car. Sold the thing to some guy for $200.

Even though I love my Maxima, the Pontiac Grand Prix GXP has caught my eye. It would be funny if I ended up buying one, it would be like coming full circle."
3226	May 27, 2005 6:15PM	fintail	My first was a dark blue 66 Galaxie 2 door hardtop I bought from an older lady for $1000 in 1993. It was in pretty decent shape, and had a tire-burning gas-guzzling (mileage averaged about 10 city/15 highway on a good day) 390/4 that made sure I was always broke. It got hit by an errant minivan a few months after I started driving, and I made out like a bandit on the insurance settlement, got a few times what I paid for it. There's no modern day equivalent to that thing, so I am safe. I loved it when I got it, but I wouldn't really want it now, as the fintail is much more practical and really is a better drive.
3227	May 27, 2005 7:01PM	iron_cross	1970 Pontiac Le Mans, full of filler and a brownish primer color. For $200 it was the biggest sleeper ever. It out and out flew down the road, or should I say it floated. At 100+ it kind of hovered and waved in the wind. Man, I miss that car. I managed to drive it for almost 2 years. I don't know how I managed that as fast and reckless as I drove it. Finally the transmission went and so did it. I'd love to have it all over again. The prices for mint condition ones now is silly.
3228	May 27, 2005 9:33PM	boomchek	A rusty 1982 Honda Accord 4 door that I paid $350 for. It had two inches of front fenders eaten away by rust. The tires were all different brand and size, THe dashboard had moss growing on it, and the front windshield was stuck in with tar. The fuel filler neck was eaten away by rust so a garden hose was in its place. Whenever I filled up gas, 1/4 of it leaked out before I left the gas station. The muffler was hanging on with ropes, and I had to drive on choke all the time to prevent it from stalling. When i jacked it up to change a tire the jack went right through the floor. Needless to say I sold it for what i paid for it.
3229	May 28, 2005 2:32AM	corvette	"I guess the newer models with a 5-speed automatic would be even better.

The 5-speed automatic is only on the six-cylinder models, which also want premium fuel. Nissan seems to trail Honda and Toyota in fuel economy on their passenger cars. They are also really late to the game in making safety features (ABS, etc.) standard--hasn't happened yet in many cases.

My car is at the port awaiting a carrier. Is it a sign of CCBA that I have to try not to think thoughts of buying something to tide me over until it gets here? Should be only a couple more weeks, anyway..."
3230	May 28, 2005 2:45AM	corvette	"I don't feel humble enough, considering some of the things I'm reading here. My first car was a one-year old 1997 Pontiac Grand Am GT V6 coupe, white with a tan cloth interior. I didn't really like it, but it got a lot of compliments. (I really wanted a 1994-5 Accord EX, but they were difficult to find--back then, the overwhelming majority of Accords sold were LX models. I still have a soft spot for those--don't like the new taillights and grille of the 1996-97 models.) I think it had about 16,000 miles when I got it and about 26,000 when I sold it. During the year that I owned it, it ate an automatic transmission and had to have the ECM reflashed due to an extremely lumpy idle. Both were warranty problems, but my parents blamed the transmission on the fact that I downshifted it when going down short (1/8 mile) hills instead of riding the brakes. That car gained speed on inclines like nothing I've ever seen. I now know that downshifting an otherwise healthy automatic is not as big a deal as my crazy parents would like to believe. The brake rotors were horribly warped when I sold it, and it probably needed new tires, but the only maintenance I did on it was a single oil change during the year I owned it. I sometimes like to measure by the yardstick of ""what if I were still driving it today."" If that were true, it would have about 150,000 miles on it, and given what I've read about the GM V6 engines, it probably would have gone through at least a couple of intake gaskets..."

Actually, the bug is getting stronger. If I had free time today, I might have stopped in at the SAAB dealer. Just to push the hot button of course (that promo still going on?)

I have looked at the new A#, and it is nice, but I don't feel like spending 29K on one. Now, a Saabaru 9-2X aero, sport package only, after the 7K rebates (and I get GM supplier pricing curtousy of EDS), will end up at about 21K. Noot too much above what I could probably get as a trade in on my tC.

Gotta go over next week and drive one.

I have been floating this idea around the house. Kids think it is fine (not that they know what a 9-2 is, they just like new cars, and want me to get one with back doors), wife thinks I'm nuts. Then again, nothing new there.

I seem to recall liking th WRX last time I drove one a couple of years back. Might be time. Just for safety of course, in case we get lots of snow this winter."

If I could trade for around $6K out of pocket... hmmm..

Usually, the way this works... for me to pull it off, I'd have to trade the wife's car... That means another $4K in options (including auto), and I'm still driving the CR-V.. That is how she ended up with the 325i, the last time..."

Bingo! I love the truck when its behaving, but man when it screws up I want to run it off Hurricane Gulch.

Looks like its going back in here soon, needs an oil change, a driver's side window regulator, and I'm going to complain about the brakes, here I thought I was going to get lucky with the brakes. Almost made 11k before any problems, but I'm noticing a vibration now when I step on the brakes. So much for that I guess.........course they will probably tell me its normal and then I'll have to throw my keys at the GM again!

I've been out in the travel trailer all day getting it ready to go, 6 days and counting. Am learning a few things about it too, lol, like close the drain on the fresh water tank BEFORE filling it! :blush:"
3241	May 28, 2005 11:16PM	andre1969	"but I'm actually tossing around the possibility of getting a new pickup. Granddad's old '85 Silverado sprung a fuel leak somewhere in the passenger side fuel tank. Not sure where it's leaking, but it happened right after the tank got filled up, so I'm guessing somewhere near the top, like maybe where a sending unit goes in or something? Anyway, it has a big plastic shroud around it, so I really can't see where it's coming from.

Now I've only had to put around $700 or so into this truck in the past year, and now that I think about it, have probably only put around $800-900 total into it since Mom gave it to me back around September 2002. So I guess it's only natural that it's time to sink some more dough into it.

But then, I heard on the GM thread how they're thinking about letting the general public have GM employee pricing. Well, I spec'ed out an '05 Sierra using Edmunds, and one like I'd want it, just a basic work truck with a short cab, long bed, 262/auto, a/c, radio with CD, sliding rear window, and even a handling package (just a rear sway bar) only comes out to around $15,600, after incentives and such.

And I'm sure that even with just the 262 V-6 these days, it would perform as well as the wussy 305 in my old Silverado.

Of course, this would probably squash my Charger fantasies for awhile, because if I bought a new truck I'd probably keep the Intrepid awhile longer. And in the long run, it's going to be cheaper to just fix the gas tank on the old truck than buy a new one, but I'm in the mood, dangit! :shades:"
3242	May 29, 2005 6:00AM	corvette	I would venture that the work truck will be adequate with the V6, but you may have a hard time finding one without the V8, or with the handling package. You will not regret going with a full-size truck over a compact or midsize!
3243	May 29, 2005 11:34AM	jjtj	There was a 98 4Runner in the local paper the other day.. said runs good, no rust, from So. Carolina, has a fuel leak (?).. $1000. Needless to say, it was gone when I called. I thought the fuel leak thing was weird, but I can't imagine it being catastrophic, esp. at $1000 for a 98 4Runner!
3244	May 29, 2005 2:11PM	stickguy	"If you did go that way, I assume it would be a special order. In that case, I wolud go with the V8. More power, flexibility, towing/hauling ability, and overall more fun! That, and it seems like on big heavy vehicles, the small engine gives little if any improvement in MPG.

Besides, a V8 just sounds better!"

Was actually able to get Mrs. Michaell to hit a few car lots on Saturday ... this after Mrs. Michaell and the daughter spent Friday running errands and the daughter pretty much decides she doesn't want to learn how to drive a stick.

First stop - Toyota/Scion dealer, to review the xA. Daughter has seen pics and compares it to a 4 door Mini Cooper. Took a close look at one in the showroom. Boy, is it small! But, 31/38 MPG is nothing to sneeze at. Went back later that day to have daughter drive it. She proclaims it is fine for her needs.

Second stop - Mini dealer. Mind you, it's unlikely that the girl will get a Mini, but she's been lusting for one ever since the remake of ""The Italian Job"" came out. Turns out there were lots of cars on the lot, including an '03 with CVT and 19,000 miles for $17K. Yellow with black roof and interior. Wife is tempted to buy it on the spot. I tell her that the insurance might be prohibitive for a 16 year old girl. Wife also lusts after the Electric Blue convertibles. When the time comes for us to acquire our ""fun"" car, this might just be on the list.

Also on the short list is the Saturn ION 2 or another Focus ZX5 (with an auto tranny this time).

Scion is about $14,500 (basic car with auto tranny and security system that includes keyless remote), the ION prices out around $17K (with $2K in rebates at the moment) and the Focus would be about the same (need to price it, but Ford is offering $2K in rebates plus a free auto tranny - $800).

Surprisingly, I'm really torn about this .. personally, I'd like the girl to learn how to drive a stick and be done with it. Not sure I want to start over with another 48 payments just to get the slushbox. On the other hand, I have to maintain my CCBA status somehow...."

As a parent of 3 former teenagers, I ask -- how would you feel about seeing any of those cars (not the kids hopefully!) mangled at an intersection or dented by another teen in the high school parking lot? I recommend older used cars that you're not heavily invested in, either in terms of $$ or love!"

Probably a good thing the SAAB dealer was closed last night when I stopped by to browse at the 9-2x (my current fascination, subject to change at any moment)."
3266	May 31, 2005 4:46PM	michaellno	"Trust me, I've been there, done that, and have the T-shirt. I've probably posted as much as anybody in forums that deal with teenagers and cars.

Most of the regular posters in these forums will know all of what I'm about to say, but to catch you up.....

In addition to the 16 year old daughter, I've got an 18 year old son who totalled his first car 5 weeks after he acquired his license, sending his little sister to the hospital via air ambulance.

For us, reliability and safety is key. Wife is mandating that any car the daughter drives will have ABS and keyless remote, plus traction control if possible. Currently, she is only going back and forth to school and work, which is about 75-100 miles per week. However, next year she will start college, which is a longer drive, so good gas mileage is also pretty important.

At the moment, my daughter is driving my Saturn L300 (V6, leather, pretty much loaded), while I drive the Focus with the stick. Later this summer, my office is moving closer to where I live and I'd like to get my car back. Since said daughter cannot (and does not want to learn) to drive a stick shift, we are possibly in the market for another car.

The Focus is the only non-Saturn in the family. Besides the L300, my wife drives a VUE and the son is now driving an L200. Love those dent resistant panels -- hence the reason the ION is on the list. Might be easiest to trade the current Focus for a new Focus (better trade value?), so that's why the Focus is there. The daughter, who isn't too much into cars, has expressed an interest in the xA; plus, the value is pretty good ($14K for a car with ABS, power everything and keyless remote), so we took a closer look at it.

Me? I'm still leaning towards a used car that meets all the criteria. At the moment, the daughter isn't thrilled with driving the L300 ... she doesn't like the seating position - not upright enough for her.

The saga continues ...."
3267	May 31, 2005 5:23PM	kyfdx	"Funny.. I took the wife's car in for service today, and got a loaner.. The Saab dealership has a satellite location near there.. Mostly for service for that side of town, but they keep about 10-15 new cars there also...

So, naturally, I stopped by... 8:45 AM, so no salespeople around.. They only had two 9-2Xs.. One base with automatic and moonroof, and one Aero with automatic and heated seats.. They seem kind of pricy when stripped down like that... Over $29K for the Aero.. I wouldn't want an automatic, but I do want a sunroof, so that is about the price of the one I would want.. No sport package or leather for that price..

Even with $8K off MSRP, by the time I add tax on, I'm looking at $9K difference to trade in my CR-V.. I think I can wait.."
3268	May 31, 2005 5:40PM	stickguy	"Yup, an aero 5 speed with sport, MSRP ~29.6K, SUpplier price s/b ~28K, less what, 7K total rebates? = 21K. At 21k, starts to look like a good deal.

Still, since we are paying on my wifes van, trading in the Scion would still mean about 6K (I guess) +TTL.

Might still take a look, just to get numbers, just in case you know. If they said 4K + tax with the trade, I'd probably pull out the checkbook.

Oh, I guess I should really drive the thing first. Cart before the hrose and all (althought The 9-2 has a horse in the front and the back!)"
3269	May 31, 2005 5:45PM	kyfdx	"Yeah... I was thinking about $7K + tax.. That would be too much.. For $4K plus tax, I would be doing some serious figuring...

I've driven a WRX a few times.... I'm assuming it is very close to that..

I don't really need a car, though.. 7yr/100K warranty on my CR-V, which only has 47K... The wife's car is under warranty until probably next July at this rate... But, if they have something similar to this next year at this time, as she nears 50K miles.... then, all bets are off.."

3273	May 31, 2005 8:09PM	jluede	"some really amusing posts here.

I don't know if I've reached CCBA status yet but I just bought my third vehicle in 15 months on Friday. The lineup now includes:

2003 Honda Civic - 47,000 mi
2004 Chevrolet Silverado (Reg Cab) - 26,000 mi
2005 Honda Accord - >100 mi

I'm only 24 so I guess I've got to start somewhere.

Previous vehicles were a 1989 Silverado and a 1999 Grand Am. Should have never sold the Silverado and should have never bought the Grand Am."

At least I am fiscally prudent (OK, cheap) enough that if I upgrade my car, it won't be to something expensive enough to require a loan to make up the difference, so at least the monthly outlay won't change (although th echecking account might take a dip!)."
3275	May 31, 2005 9:34PM	danf1	I'm paid commission. Debt is what makes me get up and come to work everyday. Without it I'd probably become rather complacent.

3279	June 1, 2005 3:57AM	akangl	"Personally I would make her learn to drive a stick. My first car was an automatic and its a LOT harder to learn a stick later on. I had no choice, hubby took my car one day while I was at work and left me his stick shift truck. So, it was either sit there after work for 2-3 hours and wait for him to return with my car or just bite the bullet and drive the truck. I managed and got home, been driving a stick off and on ever since.

My son's first car will be Zippy (she's a stick) and he will deal with it. There is NO way I would trade a perfectly good car just to get him one with an automatic.

Maybe I'm cruel, but why start over on the car payment/debt when the easy way to solve it is a few lessons on how to drive a stick? I bet in less than a week she has the hang of it and you have your L300 back.

BTW, speaking of Zippy, she has less than 900 miles left on her factory b2b warranty."
3280	June 1, 2005 8:50AM	boomchek	"True about driving stick. Here's something a fellow salesperson told me that he tells every parent contemplating between buying stick or auto vehicle for their kids.

When you give your daughter or son a car to drive, it is inevitable that sooner or later they will drive it to a party or to a hang out to meet their friends. It is also very likely (even though we all hope it never happens) that where ever they're going there might or will be alcohol there, and as a result there will be drunk people (teens, young adults) at the party. Alcohol and teens don't mix but when they do usually somebody ends up doing stupid things, like borrowing or snatching their friend's car keys and taking their friend's car for a spin. By having a standard tranny car, that situation might not happen because MOST people these days don't know how to drive stick. If they don't know then they can't take off in your kid's car. (It might seem far fetched but I've seen it happen a few times where a vehicle or two was totalled because a friend let their drunk friend borrow their car for a quick spin).

Anyways teaching your son or daughter how to drive stick will give them an advantage in some situations over others who don't know how to do it. Even if she despises driving stick six months from now at least she'll understand the concept, and who knows if she might need to use it in the future?

That's my two cents..."
3281	June 1, 2005 11:45AM	PF_Flyer	"My 16 year old drives standard because she had no choice The wife insists on us owning 5 speeds (Oh, the burden...LOL)

I really think she's a better driver because of it, and that she has a little better understanding of what's going on with the car than if she just had to step on the tall skinny one on the right to make it go.

I also think it helps when she has a friend in the car (she's allowed ONE, once in a while, at the moment) as the stcik demands her attention. Much harder to yak with a friend when the car isn't shifting for you."
3282	June 1, 2005 2:41PM	michaellno	"I thought the idea here was to encourage folks to buy more cars!

All the advise I'm getting is telling me to do the opposite.

I happen to agree with what y'all have said .. as much as I want to start driving my Saturn again, I really don't want to start over with a new set of car payments. Truth be told, I don't mind driving the Focus all that much ... the only thing I'm really missing from the Saturn is the automatic (I do a lot of stop-n-go driving in my commute), the sunroof in the summer and the heated seats in the winter.

What will probably happen is that I'll keep driving the Focus until it's paid for -- 33 more payments -- then take stock of where we stand. The Saturn only has 30 payments left, so it should be paid off as well -- that is, if I don't get a wild hair and trade either one of them in for something else.

Of course, this is only my opinion -- I'm sure that if you checked with Mrs. Michaell, she might have a different set of ideas."
3283	June 1, 2005 3:39PM	anonymousposts	"kydfx: I have been begging Gee to get another car. I love his Civic but I feel my CCB taking over and since I was burdened with the Ody and Accord as ""my"" cars I can't trade right now. I wish Gee would go look at some cars!

michaell: I still think your best bet, if you do decide to get rid of the Focus, would be an Accord or Camry. The Camry can be had for $16,100 in my are with an automatic transmission and the leases on Accord's are tough to beat right now. Also, since you say you live in the snow belt might not be a bad idea to look at a used Legacy or Impreza.

We have 3 car payments and 1 mortgage payment with 2 incomes. The Civic is pretty close (for us) to being paid for and the lease on the Odyssey is up in less than 11 months and the Accord lease will end about a year after that. It's such a tough decision ... do we live car note free and just buy and sell cheaper cars to get our CCB fix or do we rush out and buy a G35, MB, Acura etc once we are rid of the Ody. I'm leaning towards option 1 but I sure love that new RL.

robr: Honda lists employee purchase program as one of the benefits of employment with them. Now I'm not sure exactly what they are but any discount is a discount as far as I am concerned. Besides, my background isn't in manufacturing so the chances of a job with them are pretty slim.

3284	June 1, 2005 3:43PM	robr2	"For some reason, having to write that check each month bugs me.

Do what I do with a car loan that is paid weekly - direct deposit every week into the credit union a little bit more than the payment amount then they take the payment away. At the end of the year, whatever is left pays for Christmas."

3287	June 1, 2005 3:49PM	michaellno	"While I agree with you regarding price on the Camry and Accord (I think I've seen Camry's from around $17K here in Denver), I'm not sure I can get them equipped the way I would like (ABS, specifically). When we looked at the xA on Saturday, the salesman pointed out a Corolla LE they had on the lot .. pretty well loaded, but with an $18-19K price tag on it. Asked if the CE trim level was available with ABS -- told no, not even as an option.

I've been on the leasing carousel in the past and I'm not certain that I want to go that route again .. ultimately, I just want the daughter to have something that is hers and she can then do with it what she wants once it is paid for.

The xA seems to be the best buy at the moment ... $14K for ABS, PW, PDL, PM, CD player, remote keyless entry, automatic. Granted, it's only 108HP, but the daughter proclaimed in the test drive that it was sufficient. Not to mention the 31/38MPG numbers, which translates to about $20 every other week for gas at the rate my daughter drives."
3288	June 1, 2005 3:52PM	anonymousposts	the Accord, even DX models, come standard with ABS, side curtain airbags, side airbags, and front airbags. It was one of only a handfull of mid-size non-premium sedans to do well in IIHS side impact tests where they simulate a crash with a truck or SUV. It's also rated at 24/34 MPG which isn't too shabby for the size and power advantage over the xA. Now the xA is a good choice but if I were buying a car for my son right now an Accord DX/LX would be at the top of my list. If she loves the car you could always buy it at the end of the lease or turn it in and let her get something of her choice .. maybe even the Mini Cooper that she's coveting at the moment. If the sedan is too stodgy you can get similar deals on the coupes.
3289	June 1, 2005 4:01PM	kyfdx	"Take your Saturn back.. If the choice is drive the Focus.. or walk.. she will drive the Focus..

Then you can start making car buying decisions on what you want or need... Like every good CCBAer should..

3290	June 1, 2005 4:02PM	michaellno	"Wasn't aware that the Accord DX came with ABS. I may have to look into that further .. but, for some odd reason, Mrs. Michaell has this thing against Hondas. Have no clue where it came from or why she has it.

I've had several Accords in the past ... an '85 LX hatch, a '92 LX sedan and a '93 DX sedan (the LX sedan went to the ex in the divorce - I moved from CA to CO and leased the DX sedan). I took a brief look at the Accords before I bought my Saturn -- but, they were running about $26-27K for the EX models with V6 and leather.

No problems with sedans ... have discovered they are cheaper to insure. Fact is, the '05 xA is $13/mo cheaper to insure than the '03 Focus ZX5, all else being equal."
3291	June 1, 2005 5:59PM	michaellno	"No need for me to take back the Saturn immediately ... right now, my commute is 65-70 miles per day, while daughter is on summer holiday from school and might put 50-75 miles per week on whatever she drives.

In September, my office is moving to a location much closer to where I live, so my commute should drop to 35-40 miles per day. At that point, I'm thinking of getting the Saturn back.

Funny you should mention the ""tough love"" approach. Mrs. Michaell and I were just discussing that very issue this morning. When the Mrs. was 17, she bought a used Nissan Sentra from the dealership with her step-father. It was a stick. Step father left and said ""see you at home"". Wife learned quickly how to drive stick."

Hubby talked to the guy tonight, told him about the place and what we want for it. The guy is even more interested now, wants to stop out and look around (eek, that means I gotta clean the house!!).

Mrs. Michaell heard an article on the news this morning about the new GM incentives ... buy a car at employee price. She asked if that made the ION a better deal. Since it's almost impossible to figure out invoice pricing on Saturns, I really don't have much idea.

RE: Camry. When I was looking for my car, I took a look at the Camry. Wife took one look at it and declared it a ""grampa car"". Of course, I couldn't find an SE that I liked to show her. Again, it was tough to find one equipped the way I wanted.

I have to admit that I have been thinking of a new car for myself. Was pricing Ford Five Hundreds on line the other day, just for grins.

AK: don't talk to me about houses. Wife occasionally comments on the things that we don't have with the house we currently live in (basement, formal dining room) and will get a burr under her saddle to move.

3297	June 2, 2005 4:06PM	michaellno	"Yep, looking at gmbuypower.com, the base price of an ION 2 with automatic is roughly $15,8, the employer price is something like $14,4 -- no idea if individual options are discounted as well. I think there is still a $1000 rebate available on the IONs; would need to double check that.

I know the MSRP of the ION 2, configured the way I want, is just a skosh over $17K. If we assume that only the base price is discounted, then we're looking at $15,6, minus the $1K rebate takes us to $14,6 -- only a few hundred more than the xA.

I know, you are all going to point out the superior Toyota build quality, better gas mileage, etc. And I happen to agree .. my folks were long time Toyota owners until they bought their Hyundai Sonata. However, I like the dent resistant panels of the Saturn, plus it's a bit larger all around (except in the rear seat, which surprisingly has less legroom than the Scion)."

The MB dealer here actually knew what the car was, and were more interested (although they tried to get me to look at a much more expensive car too). The MB dealer also acted very interested in my 126, saying multiple times that they'd be more than happy to take it in trade, or if I was ever going to sell it, to call him. I dont know if that was part of the game or for real.

3312	June 8, 2005 3:26AM	akangl	"Nice view... if you could just move the truck out of the way....

Hey, easy now, that truck is my hero, it survived that horrible 1000 mile trip towing the *Wind Sail*. I highly doubt that truck will leave any time soon."

Isn't that pretty much the kiss of death?"
3314	June 8, 2005 3:42AM	akangl	"Isn't that pretty much the kiss of death?

LOL, nah, I been saying that about Zippy for months and she's still around (almost 11 months now). The Titan is a good truck, I have no desire for a new truck. At least not until I get my Silverado 3500HD dually Duramax/Allison. That's a ways off though, won't get that until we get the 5th wheel camper."
3315	June 9, 2005 2:19PM	gee35coupe	For sure. But that would make a great picture. That's beautiful.

If only that Nissan wasn't such a good car..."
3317	June 9, 2005 8:57PM	michaellno	"Looks like we're all going to have to turn in our membership:

ak is happy with Zippy and the Titan;

andre bought his Grand Am and is probably not going to buy anything else until he gets his garage built;

anon and gee can't agree on what to sell, though they often talk about what they want to buy;

corvette has his 3-series on order, so he's probably out of the market;

and I don't really want to trade in the Focus in and may make the daughter learn to drive a stick!

Not a whole lot for us to talk about, unless I'm missing something or someone."
3318	June 9, 2005 9:27PM	gee35coupe	But we also want another house or even better no house payment. If we drive what we have now until 100K, we can pay our current house off. Just think what we could buy with a free $2500 a month. Whoo boy!!!
3319	June 9, 2005 10:07PM	michaellno	"I feel the same way ... between the two car payments (30 and 33 months) plus child support payments (24 months), we will free up quite a bit of cash monthly. Can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel!

Of course, there is college to consider...."
3320	June 9, 2005 10:44PM	jlawrence01	"I never thought that I would see the CCBA deteriorate to the point where I would see people actually giving up on BUYING another vehicle.

Honestly, I had budgeted a new car for the '06-'07 timeframe. However, since the # of miles driven is dropping and the old beater is chugging along real well, maybe I'll push it off for a few years."
3321	June 10, 2005 12:15AM	fintail	Well, no leads from anyone on the perfect C43, but I have noticed a highline dealer near here has a nice looking 52K mile 2000 E55 for what seems to be a very good price (28K I think). I might take a look.
3322	June 10, 2005 2:52AM	michaellno	"...at least someone is actively pursuing a new vehicle.

Good on ya', Fin!"
3323	June 10, 2005 3:08AM	lancerfixer	"Naw...don't settle. Wait for the C43.

If it makes anyone feel any better, I WOULD have that 300E in my driveway were I to have the cash on hand...CCB thwarted by financial misfortune! Oh, well."
3324	June 10, 2005 3:44AM	fintail	"I think I am going to hold out for a C43 too...or maybe wait til a current AMG car or maybe even a CDi depreciates to a price I would want to pay. The E55 looks cool, but it seems a bit much at the same time, in price and complexity. There's a C32 AMG from 2002 for sale not too far from here...but the price is steep and it has ugly aftermarket wheels.

I did give my desired car info to the local MB dealer last weekend...who knows when I'll get a call. He really liked my current car, so that could help. All of a sudden, it is feeling kind of big and old and stodgy, even though it is running fine and is in excellent cosmetic condition. I love it...but I am tempted all the time. I'd want it to go to a good home.

If you want that E...maybe it will be around later."
3325	June 10, 2005 5:49AM	akangl	"Its official, Zippy turned over 36k yesterday on our way to Anchorage. She's now out of the base warranty that was a strange sight. She is honestly the first car I've ever bought new and kept until it was out of the base warranty. Now we are working on the 4 year/100k ESC.........only 63k to go! Still a great little car, managed 32 mpg doing 75-80 mph with 4 people in the car.

After our trip to Dawson City the Titan has been elevated to saint status. Really great truck, can't see that leaving any time soon, and of course we all know I would be sold into slavery before the Dodge leaves, so I guess we are out of the car buying game for a while.

Gee.........Midnight Dome has to be one of the most spectacular views I have ever seen, I love that picture of the Titan up there!"
3326	June 10, 2005 5:57AM	nippononly	"has me at the AutoMart every weekend, but nothing has caught my eye yet. This would be a third car, something cheap and fun, preferably OLD, something I could work on a bit.

But I am more committed than ever to keeping the two I already have. New cars these days are just such a letdown relative to the money you lay out (did I just say that? *slaps self*)"
3327	June 10, 2005 1:00PM	andre1969	"at this point I'm somewhat torn between buying something new, and holding on to what I have. Right now I have two possible candidates for replacement.

First, my '85 Silverado. It has about 115,000 miles on it, the a/c doesn't work, the radio doesn't work (well, sometimes if you hit a big enough bump it does, but the next bump shorts it out again), it's got rust coming through here and there, and the right-side gas tank has a leak in it. Now I can deal with the a/c, because it has a sliding rear window, and between that, the little vent windows, and rolling down the door windows, it ventillates pretty well. And it doesn't get driven enough to really worry about the radio. The gas tank bothers me, and I'm going to take it in to get it checked out and see how much it would cost to fix, but I'm wondering...how dangerous would it be to just drive it, and never use that tank? The leak was in the bottom, so all the fuel leaked out. I put cans and jugs underneath it, so I was able to salvage most of it, so I'll have plenty to fill the tractor and mower with for awhile! And I took the cap off and put a screwdriver in the flap to let the remaining fumes vent out. So would it really be all that dangerous to just keep driving it? It'll cut my cruising range in half, as I'm going from 32 gallons to 16, but I never go very far with this truck, so that's really not an issue.

And even if I do look into getting it fixed, economically it makes a lot more sense to just spend a few hundred bucks to fix the leak, than to spend $15K or more on a brand-new truck! Even if it would have working a/c, a better sound system, have better fuel efficiency, better performance, and probably a better hauling capacity, as well. Although I dunno about the hauling capacity. My Mom & stepdad bought an '03 F-150 with the 4.6 V-8, and my stepdad swears that my Silverado can haul more. But, even so, I'm sure it would be adequate for my needs.

The other candidate is my Intrepid. It's currently at 107,000 miles, and is running fine, and I just put a new battery in before my recent trip to Florida. And it still looks good...the silver paint is still shiny, there aren't too many stone chips in it, and nothing's falling off, yet. But in Florida, it got...how's the best to say this? ""Violated"" I guess! Because of a lapse of judgement on my part, it now has a nasty smash in the back part of the spare tire well, as well as a puncture all the way through the bottom of it! While down there, I accidentally backed over a cut-off sign pole. There was no sign there, but there was a jagged piece of the metal pole still sticking up, which I didn't see. I felt it, though! Anyway, the car just feels like damaged goods now. I'll probably just take the cheap way out and take the spare tire out, bang out the big dent in the back with a hammer, and also flatten out the puncture the best I can and just put some sealer on it. I guess it could've been worse, though...if I had done this with any of my RWD cars, I would've punctured the gas tank! But then, maybe not, as the Intrepid sits lower than any of them.

So, what would a new Charger R/T go for? Around $30K? And add another $15K or so for a new truck? $45K total? Okay, I've talked myself out of it! :shades:"
3328	June 10, 2005 2:03PM	stickguy	"I would go for a new car instead of a new truck in your situation. You use the sedan more, and stuff like AC and reliability are more important. A pickup that you only use for local ""dirt"" duty (the dump, home depot for mulch, etc.) is perfect for a rat like the Chevy. besides, do you really want to put crap in a brand new vehicle??

Have you driven a CHarger yet? That should be the deciding factor. If you drive one and aren't thrilled, keep the Trep until it starts to fall apart on you (107K? shouldn't be long now!). But, if you can't imagine living without the Hemi, pull the trigger."
3329	June 10, 2005 2:16PM	andre1969	"I haven't driven a Charger yet, but have driven the 300 and Magnum. I like the way they ride, and they're certainly comfy enough (the front legroom measure of 41.8"" is very deceptive). The only thing I didn't like was the way the 4-speed tranny shifted with the 3.5 in the Magnum. A few years back, I drove an '02 Intrepid R/T, and it felt about the same way. The tranny just seemed like it was reluctant to shift and was ""dumping"" the hp along the way!

I think the Charger comes with the Benz 5-speed automatic even with the 3.5 though, so maybe it'll feel better.

As for the Intrepid, I have a feeling the damn thing is going to last a long time, just as long as I don't hit anything else with it. :blush: It seems like with the Intrepid, they either end up crapping out early or lasting forever, with not too much middle ground. I'm guessing I got one of the good ones! It's not even leaking anything yet, although it is losing about a half-quart of oil maybe every 1000 miles.

You're probably right on the truck, though. It's foolish to spend that much on something that's just a second car and won't get used a whole lot. It'll be 3 years in October that my Mom gave me the Silverado, and I think it's only had about 5-6,000 miles added to it in that time. And a lot that is because I let one of my buddys borrow it from time to time."
3330	June 10, 2005 2:19PM	davem2001	"From what I've read, the 5-speed auto will be across the board for 2006. The 4-speed will be gone.

http://www.autoweek.com/news.cms?newsId=102475"
3331	June 10, 2005 2:22PM	fintail	Ha if they cut their price in half, I'd want this
3332	June 10, 2005 2:28PM	andre1969	that's cool, because it's getting to the point now that a 4-speed is so passe, especially in higher-end cars. Now, if they can just ditch the 2.7 from the lineup for the 300 and the Magnum and make the 3.5 standard, I think they'd have a real winner. The 2.7 isn't bad in a smaller car like the Sebring/Stratus, and even in my Intrepid it's okay for my needs. But it's really overmatched in a 300/Magnum! And truthfully, if I had it to do over again, I wouldv'e held out for a 3.5!
3333	June 10, 2005 2:30PM	davem2001	"Yeah, I don't get the point of the 2.7 in those cars? It couldn't be any cheaper to build, etc... (Isn't it actaully more complex than the 3.5L - dohc vs. sohc?) Why not just make the 3.5L standard?

(although, if you read the article I posted above, they are using the 2.7L and the 4 speed auto in ""fleet"" editions of the Charger, too, so I was wrong about it totally going away. It's still there for the 2.7L versions)"
3334	June 10, 2005 4:23PM	michaellno	"I've had 2 vehicles with a 5-speed auto - the '02 Explorer and the wife's '04 VUE V6.

The Explorer tranny wasn't that great, IMO. Constantly hunted between gears. The VUE, OTOH, is a sweetheart. Of course, having a Honda-sourced engine certainly doesn't hurt. When we took the VUE to Santa Fe back in March, I was absolutely blown away by how smooth it was .. I set the cruise to 80 and, even on the steepest grades, it would seemlessly downshift one or two gears to maintain the set speed. The revs would go up to 3500 or so, but it was still very quiet.

The only thing I don't like about the tranny is the selections on the gearshift .. there are only 3:

Drive - allows all 5 gears to be used
Intermediate - only allows gears 1 - 3 to be used
Low - 1st gear only

Would love to have some sort of tiptronic like feature available. Friends of ours have an '04 Santa Fe with the 3.5L V6 and a 5-speed auto with the manu-matic. Nice to be able to pick your own gears upon occasion.

The L300 only has a 4-speed auto, which, 95% of the time, is adequate. The only issue I have is when I have it on cruise at 70-75MPH and I encounter a hill, it downshifts to 3rd gear and the revs jump from 2500-2700 to almost 4000. Makes a bit of a ruckus, then it has a hard time upshifting back to 4th when the road levels out. I usually have to hit the ""coast"" button for a moment to get the transmission to go back into 4th gear.

Of course, if 5 speeds are good, then 6 and 7 speeds must be better! Ask Ford and MB on that ... do you think that we'll see more cars with 6 and 7 speed automatics, or will CVT's become more prevalent.

Discuss."
3335	June 10, 2005 4:33PM	andre1969	"that you see a diminishing rate of return as you add more gears to a transmission? Back when trannies started going from 2-speed to 3-speed units (GM's Hydramatic actually started off as a 4-speed, way back in 1939!), there was a huge improvement in performance.

Then, in the 80's, when 4-speed overdrive trannies started replacing the 3-speeds, they were a boost mainly to highway economy, but also helped performance all around, as the auto makers could now put shorter axle ratios in the cars to help low-end performance, while overdrive would still knock it down to a lazy highway cruiser.

A 5-speed automatic would certainly benefit cars with smaller engines that really have to rev, and maybe big engines that are pretty weak, but do they really help out that much with engines that are well-balanced to begin with? The main reason that the 5-speed is an improvement over the 4-speed in the Chrysler LX cars is probably because the 4-speed just isn't a well-designed unit to begin with. Not necessarily because it lacks an extra gear.

My Intrepid feels like it could use an extra gear between 3rd and 4th sometimes. Once you go into 4th, it really has no power, but at higher speeds when it downshifts to 3rd, in some situations it just seems like overkill. For example, at 75 mph I'm pulling 2500 rpm in 4th, and around 3750 in 3rd.

Are CVT trannies to the point yet that they can handle the load of bigger engines? In the past, I always thought that was their main weak point, that they just weren't that strong of a design."
3336	June 10, 2005 7:22PM	michaellno	"Well, I guess we'll see how Ford makes out with the CVT that is installed in the Freestyle, Five Hundred and Mercury Montego. I think they are the largest cars that have a CVT installed in them.

The wife and I have test driven two cars that had a CVT .. the first was an Audi A4 Cabriolet with the 1.8L turbo (170? HP), the second was a Ford Freestyle Limited with the 3.0L Duratec (203 HP).

Coming from a ""traditional"" automatic transmission, driving a car with a CVT is quite odd .. there isn't any sense of ""shifting"", as the transmission is always at an optimum ratio. Neither car felt ""slow"" (a la Rabbit diesels), but neither did they feel quick. Adequate amount of acceleration.

My understanding of the Audi implementation is that it has the ""tiptronic"" mode that gives you the control over the transmission and make it feel more like a regular slushbox (upshifts and downshifts).

After I graduated college in 1985, my first boss had a Toyota Tercel with a 3 speed automatic. We went to a concert in it and I was amazed at how noisy the engine was at 55-65MPH."
3337	June 10, 2005 7:26PM	corvette	"With quite a few cars nowadays having the five and six-speed auto, those that don't look like they're a step behind the curve.

The Canyon consistently downshifts on a few of the hills between Elizabethtown and Lexington on the Bluegrass Parkway, whereas my old Altima would often stay in fourth. The Canyon is a 2wd, regular cab, with the large engine, so I imagine that a crew cab, 4wd would feel rather sluggish, and the new H3 with the same powertrain will be downright slow.

Most of the cars equipped with CVT are low-to-moderate powered cars, like the Mini, so I don't think the components in the CVT can handle high-powered engines yet."
3338	June 10, 2005 8:22PM	davem2001	Well Ford uses the CVT in the 500, Freestyle which have 200hp V6s, so we'll see.
3339	June 10, 2005 8:24PM	kyfdx	"..that instead of CVT, you'll see more transmissions like the 7-speed DSG in the Audi...

A true sequential manual that acts just like an automatic when you put it in ""D"". All of the flexibility of the CVT, without the strangeness..."
3340	June 10, 2005 9:37PM	nippononly	"why does the Charger have to be $30K? With the 3.5 (and yes, the 5-speed Benz autobox) it should be mid-$20s after you are done dealing, shouldn't it? Gosh, if anyone should have a Charger it should be you! :-)

BTW, seems a little cheesy for them to be offering a 2.7L Charger to fleet customers - there won't be much ""charging"" done by a Charger with that engine!

The first batch of Chargers is going to be that Dukes of Hazzard orange, followed by a big batch of the Banana Yellow. Which one will you pick? :-)"
3341	June 11, 2005 12:13AM	andre1969	"getting a more basic model, and even the base Charger seems to be a lot of car for the money, with a 3.5/5-speed auto and ABS for around $23000. But if and when that time comes, I think I'm gonna spring for the Hemi!

Looking at the color choices, I like the ""Magnesium"" color they offer...kind of a dark greenish-gray. I think it looks good on the Magnums and 300's I've seen, but I'll have to see how it looks on a Charger. You never know, it might not look quite the same on that car.

I know green can often make a car hard to re-sell, but I've always been a sucker for a nice shade of green!"
3342	June 11, 2005 4:38AM	nippononly	"all the Intrepids that kind of aqua green? I don't think I've ever seen one in any other color. No I take it back, I've seen a blue one too.

Green can be nice on a car. Resale be darned!

3343	June 11, 2005 3:51PM	anonymousposts	"Michaell: Our Odyssey has that 3.5L engine and the 5-speed automatic. Even in the heavy van it is a sweet engine. Smooth downshifts/upshifts and the power is always there when you need it. I do want to drive a 05 Odyssey to see how much they improved it because I can't see it getting much better.

I want to buy another car but I think I have matured a little. It's not as easy to justify the constant trading. There was a time when the Si would have been traded as soon as the stray metal from the Malibu hit and damaged the hood. There was a time when the Accord would have been gone after that old Camry kissed the rear bumper. But it's just not as easily done. We want other stuff. At least today ...."

I think I'm getting to be the same way. I told hubby the other day that even I, the queen of justification, can't justify trading any of our vehicles in.

Zippy is out of her base warranty, but I bought the ESC to cover it until 100k, still a great little car. The Dodge is his baby and does its job very well. The Titan redeemed itself on our last trip, so thankfully its staying because I really do love that truck. So, I can't even figure out how to justify trading any of them, which is fine, I'd rather pay them off and be car payment free for a while.

Might have to turn in my CCBA membership card if this keeps up. Its been 7 months today since we bought our last vehicle (the Titan). Zippy is almost a year old and the Dodge we've had for almost 2 years. Course we did buy the travel trailer 3 months ago."

It was poorly detailed (my daily driver is much cleaner than this thing), it had brand new plates but the dealer claimed it was local (yeah right), it had tinted windows of dubious quality, and of all things, it smelled weird inside. The exterior was in good shape...but the car really rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't even bother driving it.

Damn I should have snapped up that C43."

However, if one does come up...I'll probably act compulsively and buy it."

3357	June 12, 2005 9:04PM	trucker50	A friend of mine, after 5 months of fighting electrical gremilins almost from day one, recently got out from under his '05 GTO. After the dealer replaced everything they could think of GM offered him another GTO. Balking at that idea, having had enough aggrevation, he informed his dealer that if that's the best GM could do he'd go back to Ford(he'd been eyeing a sweet Mustang GT convertible) after a 12 year hiatus. The dealer(a full service GM dealer selling all GM brands) contacted GM and told they they had to do something, this guy had bought 25 new vehicles in the last 12 years and they COLULDN'T lose him. GM agreed to a buyout, giving him his full purchase price back! They took about a $7000 dollar hit because thats how much it's depreciated since he bought it( $11000 really, the price between full sticker then and wholesale now). Amazing the things that can be done if they really want too.....thought of Jolie and her woes as he related the story....he's driving a new Silverado Z71 now.
3358	June 12, 2005 9:09PM	trucker50	looked at a sweet '05 dark blue 325 today and was wondering if thats the color corvette was getting....I was kinda drawn to the 330ci black convertible though. I must admit however the 545 is more my style as I get more kicked back in my old age....anybody scene my lottery ticket? :-)
3359	June 12, 2005 9:16PM	trucker50	the guy with the GTO said while the Goat ran pretty decent his son traded his Impala SS in on a Neon SRT turbo 4 and he said it'd pretty much blow the Goat's doors off!
3360	June 12, 2005 10:28PM	hammen2	"I call BS on the SRT4 ""blowing away"" a 2005 GTO. With the LS2 the GTO is a 4.6/4.7 second 0-60 car, and a 12.9-13.2 second car in the 1/4 mile. I don't believe that stock SRT4's are anywhere near that. Start modding, and things may get closer, but throw an equal amount of $$$ at each car, and the GTO will stay ahead. The GTO is a bit heavy and may take a little to get going but once it does it pulls like a locomotive. It's very refined and you don't realize how fast you are going (I was stuck behind a couple of slow cars on an uphill on-ramp... got close to the top going 40 mph, looked left to make sure there was no traffic, and punched it to get around them, and my 80 mph overspeed warning was going off a couple of seconds later).

Of course, those cars just don't compete that well (the GTO bigger, is far more of a GT cruiser and has a far, far nicer and more comfortable interior, for example).

This coming from someone who had to scream and yell to get his first 2004 GTO repurchased (had a firewall assembly problem, and the dealer really messed the car up - was in the shop for 35 days in the 2 1/2 months I drove the car). GM screwed around for another nearly 2 months to ""process the paperwork"" to pick up my replacement car (dealership traded for it the day before Thanksgiving, finally got it in the middle of January, trucked it right into storage) - and then lost the paperwork, and I had to go in again in early February to take care of it. Fortunately, the new car has been very solid - 3 cosmetic problems (speaker grille peeling, wrong carpet retainers, and chipping finish on a rim - last 2 problems likely caused by the trading dealership), nothing mechanical, in 2 1/2 months and 2500 miles of ownership so far. Second car appears stronger and rides far better than the ""lemon"" one I owned before. I follow other GTO discussion boards and do not see people having major problems with these cars (built by Holden in Australia - certainly not typical GMNA/UAW build quality).

Very happy with the GTO, and, despite the ""employee pricing for everyone"" and $4k of GM card dollars, not thinking of buying anything anytime soon :-) Thinking of pulling a ""Jolie"" and saving up to buy GM extended warranties on the GTO and the wife's Envoy. She's already got 14k miles on that vehicle, and we only purchased it on September 30. Not as much as Zippy, but that's faster than either of us has put mileage on a new car before...

3361	June 12, 2005 11:35PM	akangl	Thankfully my Titan seems to have settled down. We haven't had any real problems with it in 6k miles. Its close to 13k now, will go in this week for an oil change, a window regulator, and possibly the new brake fix. We love the truck and have no plans to give it up.
3362	June 13, 2005 12:09AM	andre1969	employee pricing on the GTO? Even though I have my heart set on a Charger, I've kinda liked the GTO. It's probably one of the few GM cars out there right now that can hold my interest.
3363	June 13, 2005 12:36AM	hammen2	"Yes... if you can find one (many dealers are only getting 1 or 2 cars this model year and are selling out - they're only exporting 12k of them for 2005... may be increasing that for next year).

Pricing is ""around"" $30,300 for the stick... about $30,900 for the auto."
3364	June 13, 2005 1:51AM	corvette	"The 2006 currently has Monaco Blue Metallic as the only blue color option. It's darker than the dark blue offered on the 2005, and very near black. I wanted it until I saw how dark it was--it would be like owning a black car. I went with Titanium Silver Metallic, which is the cliche bright silver that you see on a lot of German cars.

I love the medium blue on the X5 and E46 3-series, I think it's Mystic Blue, but it's not offered on the '06 until September."
3365	June 13, 2005 3:24AM	boomchek	That one look like it's lowered an inch or so. I don't think they came that low stock, even from AMG.
3366	June 13, 2005 12:29PM	trucker50	I can't argue about the numbers or which one is faster just going by what my friend told me. He said while the GTO had strong accleration and you could feel it a bit in the pit of your stomach, the SRT 4 Turbo was much faster....I didn't ask him if they actually raced just took him at his word. Sometimes lighter smaller cars just seem faster and of course he is still pretty disgruntled over the whole process.
3367	June 13, 2005 12:34PM	trucker50	GTO's don't seem to be that hard to find in Kentucky..my friend's stickered for about $32 I think he said with the gas guzzler tax and he gave $27,7 for it, of course that was 5 months ago before all the incentives
3368	June 13, 2005 1:23PM	michaellno	"The daughter is going to try to learn to drive stick in the Focus this summer .. we told her that for her to reject the car out of hand without even giving herself the chance to learn to drive it was kinda silly.

Then, when my company moves to it's new location in September, we would take stock of things and, if she really is struggling with the stick, we would trade it in for something else."
3369	June 13, 2005 1:32PM	fintail	Yeah I noticed that lowered look too. That's something I want to keep away from.
3370	June 13, 2005 3:58PM	trucker50	"Your right....the blue was so dark as to almost be black....it is a 2006....I couldn't see the window sticker at the time because it had fallen and was laying upside down on the back seat....they have a 325 in Sparling Graphite but not Titanium

Good for you!! Glad to see you aren't trading the Focus, she will love driving a stick once she gets the hang of it. Mine is a blast to drive and as much as I grumble about the manual trans I can't imagine the car as an auto.......boring!

Speaking of my Focus, I'm closing in on a year, now if I make it past 18 months that will be a new record for me!"
3372	June 14, 2005 4:46AM	boomchek	Good point. Cars that have been modified are usually driven more agressively than stock. I try to stay away from modified cars cause you never know if it was done properly. Unless of course I'd be buying a CL600 or S500 with the full Brabus or Carlsson treatment done at an authorized facility
3373	June 14, 2005 1:53PM	fintail	I'm really a stickler about that...if I buy an AMG car, I don't want one with modified suspension or wheels or exhaust. I want the car as it was made. From my experience, fanatical MB people do not make any big mods to their cars. Hell, I don't want tinted windows, and I would rather have the factory radio too. I want a car cared for as I would care for it.
3374	June 14, 2005 2:17PM	davem2001	"I agree totally - the factory certainly knows what they're doing much better than ""Joe's Speed Shop"". Maybe a very reputable tuner like Brabus is Ok, but I'd still prefer a showroom stock unmodified car."
3375	June 14, 2005 3:20PM	fintail	I certainly trust factory AMG mods, and Brabus stuff too. They key is that it is applied at the source and not at a fly by night garage.
3376	June 14, 2005 3:54PM	davem2001	"I'd basically consider AMG as ""factory"", along the same lines as an M series BMW"
3377	June 14, 2005 5:21PM	fintail	Yeah, AMG is in-house of course. I think my next MB will be an AMG car unless I come across that perfect LWB 300SE fintail or some half market price CDi or big CL coupe.
3378	June 15, 2005 4:35AM	akangl	"I am trying really hard to stay OFF the CCBA wagon, but I am slipping.

Went to the Dodge dealer today to see about an ESC for the Dodge (its Ford ESC is almost up) and saw a BEAUTIFUL 2003 Protege LX, silver, sunroof, auto, power goodies, A/C (what a concept), and only 10k miles. Dealer is asking $12k. I was seriously tempted to take a closer look. Of course sitting right next to it was a Neon SRT-4 in bright red.

I resisted the urge to take the Protege for a spin and talk numbers at that time, but after sitting in road construction this evening at 80+ degrees and NO A/C (not to mention stop and go with a stick shift) I was reconsidering on the Protege. Talk me down guys!!! :sick:"
3379	June 15, 2005 11:31AM	jjtj	I wish I could help.. this GM employee pricing thing + an article I read where GM is lowering prices on Chevrolets too, is making a new Silverado reeeealy tempting. I avoid the local Chevy dealer or any other for that matter. I take different routes home, making sure I only go past places such as the Kia dealer & BHPH lots; these provide no temptation. Seriously though, I drove a Protege a couple of times.. I wasn't that impressed. I've owned two Foci (is that the right way to say Focus x 2?) & I thought the Focus handled much better and felt more roomy inside. Although the Protege5 is a pretty cool looking little car. I didn't know it got up to 80+ in AK.. not being sarcastic, I thought maybe 65 tops. Can you get A/C added at the dealer as in a Honda, or is it strictly a factory option?
3380	June 15, 2005 3:38PM	anonymousposts	"had a 2001 Protege ES 5-speed. It was a good little car but nowhere near as smooth as a Honda, IOHO. It was reliable, drove GREAT, and looked good but we didn't like the 2.0L engine on the highway. A little buzzy at the somewhat illegal speeds we may inadvertantly drive

That being said, I would defintely take the Protege with AC and power options over your Focus. I think the car can be had for around $10,000 which is still cheap and it should prove to be reliable.

That ESP is refundable right?"
3381	June 16, 2005 12:43AM	akangl	"Are NO help!!! I avoided the temptation today, not sure I can again tomorrow. I did go to the Chevy dealership today, but not to look at cars, was looking for some friends of mine that had quit at the GMC dealer. Found one of them, we caught up on all the gossip for a little while, then I had to go back to work. She was telling me about someone who was actually WORSE than me about trading cars. Another friend came up and asked what I was buying THIS time, I said nothing, I like my car. Then I mentioned I was about to have my CCBA presidency and membership revoked due to non-carbuying!

I'm not sure I can have A/C added, will check on that in a couple minutes........going to call the Ford dealer."
3382	June 16, 2005 12:46AM	akangl	"Thing is I LOVE my Focus, I love the way it drives, its smooth, corners perfect, is QUIET on the hwy, no engine noise at all. Just a great little car, but this A/C thing is KILLING me!!!!

Argh, I'm getting passed around at the Ford dealer, nobody seems to know."
3383	June 16, 2005 12:49AM	akangl	No A/C kit available, can't add it to the car. Dang it all, oh well, guess I'll stick to my window down and 80 mph!
3384	June 16, 2005 11:53AM	gee35coupe	"Makes the new Pontiac G6 look tempting. I really like that car. Thought I'd never consider a GM car. The GTO looks nice too with those new snoots. If they only made it with a sunroof. I don't understand that. I got CCBA bad right now. My Civic is in the shop and that's as good an excuse as any to want a new car. I'm fighting it though.

Test drove the new Jetta the other day. Nice car. Very solid feeling. Engine sounds like a truck though and it's very expensive when you add stuff to it. I'd rather have another Accord. Hmmmm...An Element. First generation Acura 2.2CL's are probably cheap now too. Somebody send the therapists."
3385	June 16, 2005 12:30PM	hammen2	"The GTO is engineered in Australia where temperatures can be hot and sunroofs in general are not popular. You can get a Monaro with a factory sunroof - a Webasto 710:

http://www.webastoshowroom.com/pontiac_gto_710.htm

GM's decision to make all GTO's have one standard equipment package (only options are tranny and colors, and, for '05, choice of 18"" wheels) prevented this option from being offered here. You can still get the sunroof (about $1200) and it has a pretty good warranty (including lifetime on parts), so I wouldn't worry like I would about other ""aftermarket"" sunroofs.

Trust me on this... do not go drive a GTO... if you do, you will want one. It will consume you until you break down. I've talked with several other GTO owners who test-drove the car on a lark and ended up driving one out the door. Even taken a couple of detractors for a spin and had THEM change their tune about the car. Yes, it is that good - if the rest of GM's lineup was as well-executed as that car, they wouldn't have sales problems..."
3386	June 16, 2005 2:11PM	gee35coupe	"I don't like the ""aftermarket"" look of it. That lip along the edge that they have to have for rigidity. I like the flush look of the roofs that are stamped in at the factory. I have no doubt that they are intoxicating though. I saw one last night(with a sunroof) that was absolutely beautiful. And that throaty sound...MMMMM"
3387	June 16, 2005 4:13PM	jjtj	I've gone the stripped out econo-car route a few times in my CCB life.. one time I leased a new 97 Mountaineer with everything on it.. it was only a 2 year lease & when it was up I bought a Honda Civic hatchback. I got alot of satisfaction in the 35-40 MPG and low cost to own that car. But it did have A/C so I couldn't complain about that. Even the 5-speed was a nice change. In the end though, my wife HATED that car and we only kept it 6 months.. she just had to have one of the NBS Jettas at the time, and with my habits, who was I to stop her.
3388	June 16, 2005 11:22PM	corvette	I drove my best friend's Focus four-door last night--I had never driven one before. I was quite impressed. The steering was very firm (a plus in my book), it seemed to have good power even with an automatic (although I didn't exhaustively test that aspect), and while it might be cramped for taller people, it's the perfect size for me. I'm not a big fan of the interior design, though. I can see why they used the platform for the Mazda3 and Volvo S40/V50.
3389	June 17, 2005 12:24AM	akangl	"I *looked* at the Protege today, seems very clean, non-smoker, nice well cared for little car. Didn't have time to drive it. Going to be at the Nissan dealer in the morning, might take a peek at a new Sentra. It was darn near 90 today, that car is going to be the death of me, lol, well, either that or work, they don't have A/C there either.

I'm off to bed, have to be back at work by midnight, driving the Titan tonight since it has to go in for an oil change in the morning."
3390	June 17, 2005 1:50AM	jjtj	"I agree regarding the Focus handling.. I've had two of them. First was a 2000 SE Wagon, great little car, tons of utility & a very nice driver. Then I had an 03 ZX5 5-dr hatch. Handled even better with 16"" wheels. But it had a vibration they could never get rid of and it drove me totally nuts. The steering is dead on & they seem very roomy inside. Even after the 03 fiasco, I'd consider possibly buying another one at some point. I think the 05 redesign makes it look a little too generic though."
3391	June 17, 2005 2:29AM	stickguy	the 3 and S40 aren't based on the current US Focus platform. The new Euro focus (tht we don't get) shares the new platform with Mazda and VOlvo.
3392	June 17, 2005 3:22AM	corvette	"Oops... The old model is still a nice driver, though!

Cars with sporty aspirations shouldn't have light, overboosted steering--I'm referring to my old Altima here."
3393	June 18, 2005 4:06AM	akangl	"Fell off the wagon today. I had to take the Titan to the Nissan dealer for an oil change this morning (after a 12 hour shift at work). I decided to take a look at a new Sentra 1.8S, drove it, BORING!!! So the salesguy (really a wizard, but they call him the assassin, lol) says ""I've got the car for you!"" He runs around back and comes out with a 2002 Nissan Sentra SE-R Spec V, car has a meer 18k on it, I drive it and I'm in LOVE!!! Although that pesky 6th gear took a bit of getting used to.

Anyway, we get back to the dealer and they run the numbers, looks like a done deal.............until I asked Bill (the GSM) what exactly the Sentra booked for, so he looks it up........He gets this ""dead mullet"" look and says ""I'm going to kick someone's REAR (not his exact words)"" Apparently some genius took the car in at RETAIL!!! So, that kicked that deal, I'm not paying a premium for the car.

I did go drive the 2003 Protege and while its not the Spec V, its a super nice car, (EXTREMELY clean) very fun to drive, pretty much like my Focus (same engine I believe, hp numbers and all were the same). Cool car, very peppy even with the auto, not buzzy at all, extremely quiet, even at 80. Going back to run numbers on Monday unless I either chicken out or dive after the 2005 Cobalt I also drove today.

I'm also going to check with my little brother about pulling an A/C system out of a wrecked Focus and putting it in my Focus.........not sure how doable that is, but its possible.

So there you have it, my CCBA membership may not be in jeapardy after all.

If I go for the Mazda I'll be losing 27k miles, gaining a factory warranty (4 year/50k b2b), and not financing any more money than Zippy. However, I will have to give up my beloved little Zippy."

So I saw a '98 Saturn SL2 with 90K in nice shape, $3000. Only thing is, it is stick shift. I wonder if she would learn to drive stick to get a free car.

It's got ABS, and SL2s aren't exactly race cars, so I figure it should be fairly safe for her to drive as a newbie, not to mention cheap to insure and whatnot. And I would drive it for 18 months before she got it, so hopefully it would satisfy the CCB bug that has been buzzing in my brain so much lately I am rapidly losing it! :-)"
3396	June 18, 2005 4:02PM	akangl	"I did the 10 pay, so I've only paid a small portion of it, but will get that back. Our skidder drained any extra money we had and its not done yet. Sometimes things have to be bought on payment, lol. I think I'm going to go ahead and work a deal on the Mazda, that is if the Chrysler dealer where the car is sitting will do it.

I wish the car was at the Nissan dealer, I trust them and they would be VERY fair. They offered $7k for Zippy. I was in the sales office (I'm a *special* customer to them) and the GSM was working the deal, he asked what I wanted for my Focus and I said payoff.......but I know its not worth that, so $7k (trade value) will do. He laughed and said he was glad I knew what my car wasn't worth.

ARGH, if only the Nissan dealer had been in that SE-R Spec V correctly, it would have been a done deal yesterday. I WANTED that car BAD!! But no, they had to be in it at retail..........$12k, OUCH! I wonder who's butt got kicked yesterday.....they had just taken the car in trade the night before and I guess the GSM didn't desk that deal. Guy that had the car bought a Titan. At least the GSM was honest about it and didn't try to tell me retail was something else, he booked the car and was real straight up about it. I did ask him if they had something else that I might like, he said no, but he would keep his eyes open and give me a call if something rolled in."
3397	June 18, 2005 4:39PM	stickguy	"1) worth works both ways. What they paid for the Sentra (trade in) is irrelevant to what it is worth, and hence should sell for. Same as your pay-off has nothing to do with what your car is worth.

2) that Se-R would be a horrible choice for you , bwtween the weather and miles you put on a car. Maybe fun when it's nice, but not really a great long distance car. Plus, it's a stick, remember?

Not trying to talk you out of geting something new, just trying to point you in the right direction! The Protege sounds like a better choice for you.

The Se-R would, however, work just fine for me!"
3398	June 18, 2005 5:08PM	akangl	"1) Yes I know, the GSM was just joking with me because he knew he could. He knows I used to be in the car business and know my way around the numbers. I was playing with him, lol.

2) BUT BUT BUT, it was FUN to drive. However, looking at the EPA mileage estimates it was lower than the Focus and yes, would have been a bad choice. The Mazda is almost a no brainer........my hold up.......while I love an automatic for the short term, I get BORED with it long term. I may grumble at times about rowing my own gears, but I LOVE my car and how it drives. I wouldn't change that about Zippy, only things I would change is add A/C and Cruise Control. Ford has a kit for cruise, but the A/C thing is a killer."
3399	June 18, 2005 5:45PM	danf1	Look on the bright side. If you do get it, you may get tired of letting it shift for you, and go buy something else within a year. Always look out for your platinum status. Besides, if you stop buying cars then I can't tell my wife that there is someone worse than me.

I've been pretty good lately, haven't bought a new car in 7 months (almost 8 months, not since the Titan) and Zippy will be a year old next month.

I'm pretty torn, I mean we aren't adding debt really by buying a new (used) car, payment won't change, I'm just losing 27k miles and gaining a factory warranty again. Its not such a bad deal, BUT, I'm really have a hard time wanting to do it, I love Zippy and she's a car I trust very much. I know Zippy will start at any temp in the winter, I know her heater will work great (too great!), I know how she handles slick roads, snow, ect. Its hard to give that up. Its also (as much as I grumble sometimes) hard to give up my stick shift.

I'm going back to the Dodge dealer today to drive the Mazda again (not taking Zippy), if I still like it and still want it come Monday I'll go work numbers then. If I rush into this I know I'll do something I will regret. If I had bought the SE-R Spec V I can honestly say that would have been pure impulse, at least with the Mazda I'm thinking about it long and hard. Going to go look at an 05 Focus too and maybe a couple of other cars.

A friend of mine was telling me about someone who's worse than ME!! She said the woman has bought like 8 cars in the past year, she trades every 1-3 months. Mostly new cars too, a couple used ones in there.

In the past year we've bought the 2 Titans (one June 11, 2004 and one November 11, 2004) and the Focus (July 21, 2004), that's it for cars. The Ram we've had since 11/12/03."
3401	June 19, 2005 5:06AM	akangl	"I went and drove the Protege again today. I told the salesguy (really nice guy) that I'd be back Monday to do the deal. Would have done it today but I didn't drive the Focus since its a PITA with the kids and it was hot out. The sales manager assured me it would be a done deal, he wasn't worried in the least, lol. We'll see, if the numbers come up to what I want I'll bite, if not I'll keep Zippy and deal with it.

I do like the Protege, its a nice clean little car with LOW LOW LOW miles. I checked it over very well today and don't see any accident damage or any other problems. Inservice date was 2/24/03 and its a one owner car, salesman pulled a Car Fax for me today. So its under warranty until 2/24/07 or 50k miles (just under 40k miles left on the B2B).

Unless you guys can see a reason I shouldn't do it, I'm gonna........gotta keep my CCBA status, I'm falling behind!"
3402	June 19, 2005 12:16PM	jjtj	I'll add a little support to keeping your car, which I know goes against our core values, but here goes.. my wife has this idea that there are two kinds of cars - good ones and bad ones - the good ones were born with a halo over the roof and will always just treat you right . This sounds like your option-less Focus. I had a 99 Ranger with a huge halo. Then there are the others.. they have horns & a pitchfork stuck to the drivers' side mirror. This is what my 03 Focus was. No matter how hard you or the dealer try, the darn thing will never be right. They can throw every part at it, bring in every regional service rep for a pow-wow, but things will just never go your way with that car. I'm not saying the Protege is either of these, but when you know that you have a good one, you better hang on to it! The Protege might have stuck somebody else with it's pitchfork!
3403	June 19, 2005 11:31PM	trucker50	When I left for work a week ago Jolie's Titan had just been elevated to saint status, the Dodge was as secure as ever and she was still in love with Zippy....my oh my what a little heat and perspiration can do to a person's perspective LOL....I hope the numbers come out right on the Protege for you, I've perusing the lots myself today and thinking about trading the Impala :-) though if I do it I'll probably give it a month or 2 waiting for year end deals....and there's still that '06 Harley I have to negotiate for as soon as the new prices have been confirmed.
3404	June 20, 2005 1:51AM	akangl	"My Focus was definatly born with a halo, Zippy has been the greatest car I've ever owned. That's a HUGE hold up for me, the Protege doesn't appear to have any issues, however, neither does my Titan at the moment. My Titan hovers between horns and a halo, the past 7k miles have been halo, while the first 6k were definatly horns and a pitchfork.

I'm having second thoughts and I tend to run with my gut instinct which will probably keep me driving Zippy. I trust her, I KNOW her, I KNOW she will always start no matter what the temp, I know how far I can push the fuel light, I know how she's been treated her whole life. Its tough to give up a KNOWN car for an UNKNOWN car.

I'll decide tomorrow, but the way I'm feeling tonight Zippy is probably safe. I do love that little car, no matter how hard she is to cool off. Hmmmm, maybe add a sunroof, that might work in place of A/C."
3405	June 20, 2005 1:53AM	akangl	"The Titan is still at saint status, no issues in a while, we are towing over 1k miles this week with it on our trip to Clam Gulch. I'll report back after that trip as to whether or not the Titan has retained her halo. We leave tomorrow night.

Zippy, well, I do love Zippy, but I HATE heat and no A/C (ha, I wasn't saying THAT at -56 this past winter). I'm having some pretty major second thoughts, gonna sleep on it tonight and decide tomorrow."
3406	June 20, 2005 1:00PM	danf1	I wouldn't reccomend sleeping on a car. First they are pretty hard. Not the most forgiving surfaces. Plus you don't want to dent the hood.

The supply of Harley's is much better then a few years ago but man those bikes still blow out the door as fast as they can get them!
3408	June 20, 2005 2:56PM	trucker50	"The year end deals will be even better. I know that GM deal looks good on paper but it just looks like the same deal in different clothes. If ya get a car at employee pricing without a rebate(most models) it's not much better then getting one at invoice(or even sticker) with one. I had the opportunity last September to get a new F-150 at $11,3 off sticker....employee pricing with $6150 dollars in rebates and obviously they where STILL making money. 'Course at those pircies ya gotta almost give ''em your trade. With gas and everything I just gotta believe they are gonna sweeten it a little more.

foreign manufacturers must be watching and laughing....your lucky to get a thousand off a Honda or Toyota"

I was surprised to see the sign in front of Boston Harley advertising IN STOCK and MSRP."
3410	June 20, 2005 8:00PM	trucker50	Yeah isn't that something. I bet car manufacturers wish they had the problem of just getting MSRP for their cars. It's amazing the dealer markup some Harley dealers are still getting though. I travel alot in my job however so have the chance to comparison shop somewhat. Unfortunately the local dealer here is one of the highest in the area....if he can get within a few hundred of my best deal I'll porbably buy there though 'cause thats where I'll have to service it.
3411	June 20, 2005 9:17PM	corvette	There is a relatively new Harley dealer in Bowling Green, about 100 miles south of you. Haven't heard anything good or bad about their reputation, though.
3412	June 21, 2005 1:53AM	akangl	"I went to the dealer where the Mazda was and we worked numbers, came down to a diff of $3k ($7k for Zippy and $10k for the Mazda), too rich for my blood. I pretty much had decided against trading Zippy before I even got there, but wanted to see what they had to offer. I have NO regrets in keeping Zippy, but I think I would have had MAJOR regrets had I bought the Mazda.

Next on the agenda is to get Zippy a sunroof or A/C.........maybe both.

I'll be leaving tonight for Clam Gulch, *see* you all when I get back Saturday night. :P"
3413	June 21, 2005 1:28PM	qbrozen	"hmmmm.... what would the AC conversion cost? $1800? $2K? Does the Mazda have less miles than Zippy? If the answer is yes, I think it would be worth the $1K extra to make the trade.

Not that i'm trying to be an enabler or anything....

OH, wait a sec. I just went back and looked at the posts again. 27K less miles! PLUS a sunroof! PLUS AC! PLUS cruise control! Good grief, I think this is a no brainer!"

3417	June 22, 2005 4:25PM	anonymousposts	"took a weekend trip to Florida. Our intent was to drive the Accord and get the windows tinted but ending up taking the easy way out and drove the mini-van. Gosh, I LOVE that van. I will hate to see it go back in April. Got 25 MPG even with the front and rear AC on, 4 people in it + Little Gee, and with an average speed of 80 MPH.

nippononly: The Saturn would be a good car for what you will use it for. My sister needed a good car for less than $2000 and we found her a 98 SL2 with 90,000 miles for $1500, It was an automatic with AC, cruise, and power windows. It's now at 111,000 and has given her no major problems (knock on wood). The rear windows keep coming off their tracks but for what she paid for it you can't really hold that against it.

akangl: Why not look at a G6 or a slightly larger car that still gets good gas mileage? I still think an Element would be quite perfect for your lifestyle/needs if you could get over the looks. I actually like the way the Element looks and I love the way it drives and it's utility."
3418	June 22, 2005 4:49PM	andre1969	had a '96 Saturn sedan, and he ran that sucker up to around 175,000 miles with no major problems. He sold it maybe 2 years ago now, and for all I know it could still be running! The last I saw it, it seemed like it still had plenty of life in it! No smoking, rattling, nasty, wheezy noises or anything like that.

What a sweet car, and no substitue for the steering feel and balance of a nice RWD car. Big improvement inside from the old model (lot's mroe room too), and the exterior doesn't really look too bad.

Only slight problem is the 34K sticker the way I want it. Guess it's time to start waiting for a year end lease deal, or to plan the trip to Germany next spring."

The car itself is no more expensive than a loaded minivan, full-size pickup, or midsize SUV.

3425	June 25, 2005 2:00PM	danf1	There are huge rebates on the 9-2x right now. I'm working with driftracer on one. Still trying to make that Saturn go away. The only problem is that I can't keep the Aeros in stock. $6,000 and employee pricing is almost too good to be true on this car.

3432	June 26, 2005 2:12AM	nippononly	"do I ever wish I had space for a third car. Saw me a '96 SVX today - now there's a car you NEVER see. It was that color of purple they made that was almost black. Fully loaded, 140K, they were asking $5500 firm. The body had more than its share of dings, but no major stuff.

The sale sticker kept emphasizing how ""this car was $38,000 new!"". That's great, dear, but it was withdrawn from the market shortly after you bought yours because of lack of sales. What does that tell you?! :-)

Still, if I had space for a third car at my current place, it would be worth $5500 to me. Love those windows that come in two parts. You could truly say you had a car no-one else had...I wonder if I could park it at my sister's place...:-P"

$5500? I could find a sub-100K Porsche 944 for that price..."
3434	June 26, 2005 4:43AM	akangl	"Did ya miss me??

Ok, to answer the questions on the Protege, they wouldn't come off the price, I was willing to do a $1500 diff, NOT $3k. The car was nice, but I like Zippy much better. Its only really 2 months out of the ENTIRE year that having A/C would be nice, other than that Zippy is PERFECT!

So, Zippy will stay with us and Jake will get her when he gets his permit, he will learn to drive on Zippy. My little Zippy will be a YEAR old in just 3 weeks, she will be very close to 40k miles.

On another note, the Titan turned 14k this morning, what a GREAT truck. We totally enjoyed our trip, towed over 1k miles and the truck was flawless........so was the travel trailer."
3435	June 26, 2005 8:04AM	nippononly	"yes, yes, true enough. $5500 is way too much for that car. I was just in the grip of car fever this afternoon!

Now at $2500, I would probably just do it and figure out where to park it later. Even the leather was intact - usually in older SVX's it is just in big chunks by the age of 9. :-)

I bet it costs a mint to insure."
3436	June 26, 2005 1:51PM	gee35coupe	"But the non-roll down windows making keeping the climate control working imperative scares me in a car that old.

As far as the differences between the IS and the Bimmer, I bet it'll actually be pretty significant comparably equipped. I mean adding leather costs $1500. And it goes downhill from there. Adding leather to a $30k small car???? I'm sticking with the IS."
3437	June 26, 2005 7:30PM	corvette	"The standard leatherette is nice, and no one will ever know the difference.

I thought the lower halves of the windows in the SVX rolled down? Do they just not provide much airflow? Used Subarus do crazy money, but not that crazy..."
3438	June 26, 2005 7:39PM	nippononly	"the lower halves of the windows do roll down, and besides, one thing I have never had problems with in old Subes is the climate control. Whoever they use for their A/C (it used to be Hitachi) makes a fairly hardy one.

Sadly, that SVX I saw will probably be on the market for a couple of months, then they will just give up and donate it. A much under-appreciated model."

3448	June 27, 2005 5:18PM	jaserb	"I've kicked around the idea of getting a newer pickup to replace my little old Ram 50 but the darn thing just runs too well, even with 165k miles. The only excuse I had was that the A/C didn't work. I fiddled around with it when I first bought it, and I could tell that the A/C switch was broken, and when I tried to run power directly to the compressor the clutch didn't kick in. So I figured it needed at least an A/C clutch, probably a compressor, and who knows what else. Not cost effective on a sub $2k truck.

So last week I got a bead on a suitable replacement - '03 Mazda B2300 extended cab. Great MPG for a truck (it has the same 2.3 4 banger from the Mazda 3/6), A/C, cruise, CD, and jump seats in the back. The lot was asking $9950, I thought about going in and floating $8500 for it. Then, on Saturday I was driving down the freeway in the old Ram when a windstorm blew through, so I shut the windows and turned on the fan blower. After a few minutes I noticed the air from the vents was actually ... you know, ... cold. ""Wow"", thinks I. ""That's some cold front that blew through - the temperature must have dropped 30 degrees!"" About that time I saw one of those electronic signs that display the time / temperature - it showed 94 degrees :surprise:

So, to make a long story short, my A/C has started spontaneously working, and is ice cold. All I can figure is that a previous owner / shade tree mechanic hard wired the compressor to kick in whenever the fan is turned on, and that the A/C clutch has come un-stuck as I've been driving the thing. So much for that CCB excuse...

They were dressed up a bit, with a CD player, cruise, bucket seats, and a sliding rear window. Better than the fleet special Rangers, anyway. 29 MPG highway, and more cab space in back to carry stuff - or people you don't like much. Ford only put the 2.3 in the regular cab Rangers. You can find extended cab Mazdas / Rangers with the V6 and 5 speed all day long, but it's the nasty old prehistoric 3.0 Vulcan my dad had in a 1986 Taurus. I think it gets you 4 more HP and 8 fewer MPG. Not a good trade off, in my book.

The point, however, is moot, due to my truck's miracle healing. I might just have to bite the bullet and pour that money into the Alfa...;-)

3453	June 27, 2005 8:57PM	stickguy	My SIL traded in an Accord on a Volvo because the cassette player jammed and it needed new wiper blades (this was about 12 years ago when people still played cassettes). At least that was the lame excuse whe came up with, but it did work for me!
3454	June 27, 2005 9:34PM	michaellno	"My sister, who had a perfectly serviceable Honda Odyssey, traded it in for a GMC Yukon Denali because the 3rd row of seats didn't split! She has 3 boys, ages 8, 5 and 2 and was complaining that, because of the split seat feature in the 2nd row, she couldn't put all 3 boys there, meaning that the amount of cargo space was limited with the 3rd seat upright.

With the Yukon, she can fold away 1/2 of the 3rd seat if need be; in reality, she can fit all 3 boys in the 2nd row and have the entire rear area for cargo.

(In reality, I think that it was my BIL's decision to get rid of the Odyssey ... I don't think he was too hip on being seen in a ""mommy mobile"". Image is pretty important to him, as he traded in an Infiniti G35 halfway through its lease for a BMW 530i. Also, the first thing the Yukon got was a set of 20"" wheels and tires; more reinforcement of the 'style over substance' argument.)"
3455	June 28, 2005 12:49AM	corvette	I can also tell the difference, but the real stuff isn't worth it to me, compared to the no-cost leatherette. If it came standard only with cloth, I would probably spring for the leather.
3456	June 28, 2005 12:53AM	stickguy	"When I was looking last week, the one I drove was a prmium, with gray guts. Looked nice. I'm honestly not sure I could tell the difference, at least not without concentrating on it.

But, the leather does offer more colors. There is a real nice reddish/bron color in the leather, that would look great with the right exterior color."

I can't bring myself to part with Zippy, she's far too good of a car. Will turn 38k tomorrow. Oh, might get the cruise control out of that Focus too for Zippy, that's an easy install.

We are only 11 months from our big vacation next summer, need to get some money saved up.........would like to have $7k+ before we leave. That and my love for Zippy has me staying with her.

In fact, now that I remember, I actually rented one back in '93. Standard cab long bed. Had to pick up a dining room set from my sister in San Diego (I lived north of LA) before I moved to Colorado.

--> has been repainted twice before this last restoration
--> engine overhaul at 90,000 miles
--> truck now shows 135,000 miles (yes, in 35 years!)

Should I ever inherit it, about the only thing I think I would do is add some custom wheels, just to dress it up a bit.

350 with a 4-bbl carb, plus some sort of custom muffler/exhaust. Used as a truck - dad was a firefighter by profession, but always had a second job as a carpenter, plus he owned a boat for many years and used the truck to take it to the lake.

When I was younger, I borrowed the truck to run in a TSD rally ... now, that was a blast!

What's funny is that I think he finally had to replace the original license plates - he had the old, old, CA gold lettering on the black background plates!"

As for the M3. Due to an ignorant company policy we are not allowed to buy the M3. Probably for the best because neither one of us are mature enough to drive a 300HP+ RWD car but it would've been nice."
3475	June 30, 2005 2:59PM	oregonboy	"I believe that the 3.4 V6 was only offered with an auto in the T100. I have that engine with a 5-spd in the (smaller) Tacoma. It's a sweet engine: torquey and gets mid-20's MPG. To my knowledge, the only problem with that engine was head-gasket failures on some of the early engines. That was addressed by a recall, as I remember.

I think that you (as home owners) would find the T100 far more useful as an extra vehicle that the spider-condo Lexus.

kyfdx -- funny comment about the M3 ... too bad they don't have a wagon version of either the M3 or the M5... MB, at one point, offered an E55 wagon, and if my lottery numbers ever hit big, I'd try to find an Audi RS6 wagon."

Thought about asking if they could blow me away with a lease price ($299/month sounds about right!), but was sorta afraid they might be able to do it!

MSRP of 44K. Ouch. Thank god for rebates and lease support! Probably could drive out for less monthly than an A3 or strippo 325i.

We would buy sooner if it weren't for the Odyssey. We can see the light at the end of the lease though and only have to make 9 more payments and then we are done. That will give us a bit to see how the quality looks on the Mazda5 and give them time to start discounting them heavily enough to make it an even better deal than it already is. $22,000 MSRP gets you NAV, climate control, roof, 17"" wheels, fog lights, and seating for 6 (admittedly 6 adults in the 5 would be a stretch though)."

I've seen some listings for some cars that actually look pretty respectable in my price range albeit with high miles. Some of the other stuff, it's amazing what some people are trying to move. It's like call the wrecker, dude.

Funny part is it had hand made signs all over it, but not one (that I could find) listed the model year! Lots of $3,400s, and references to ""new AC"" (which probably cost more than that) and ""all controls work"". Made me want to buy!"
3516	July 12, 2005 7:00PM	fintail	"I hear from many that the 420 is a better choice than a 560, decent performance but better maintenance. Still, I would be leery.

The easiest way to tell age is the interior...later (89-91) cars have pleated door panels and more modern seats. I wouldn't touch one without history and an inspection though. They are kinda thirsty too.

It probably just had an AC service. The AC in those cars seems to be sturdy...mine has been recharged once over 16 years and 180K+ miles, and its still nice and cold. All controls working is good, though. The cruise, windows, and locks on those car can crap out. If it was a genuine good car it's worth it.

On the CCB note...a C43 is a hen's tooth. I've seen one on the road here over the past month, and it was all ruined and pimped out. Maybe I'll just wait for a C5 to depreciate, or even a CDi. I've looked at several lots here...and although the cars are newer...there's none I really like enough to get me out of the 126. It's too nice and pleasant to walk away from."

It began to cost too much to keep running. The last three years that I had it, I spent $8,000 in repairs.

The fuel injection went out twice ($2,000, second time free)... but, still never ran the same. The Mercedes dealers, I've determined, can't fix anything... only replace parts and sometimes that doesn't even work!

The air had never been recharged in 9 years and was ice cold. It was the other stuff that rattled my nerves... but, the car still looked like brand new when I traded it.

126s were great cars, especially relative to the competition at the time. At over 180K, mine still looks pretty close to new, inside and out. Everything works, the paint has held up amazingly, and so has the leather. Mine is a 6cyl though, so none of the V8 maintenance and hassle (and none of the speed). But the little 3L moves it along fast enough, and it still sounds pretty good when revved. I've never taken it to a dealer. I've had it for heading for 4 years...I've put maybe just under $1000 into repairs (suspension renovations and a FI part) not counting normal maintenance."

My disappointment is that I was rear-ended about a year and half ago. The only damage ($1,800) was mainly on the rear bumper cover and the metal behind the bumper. When the plastic bumper was pushed in, it pushed up on the bottom of the trunk lid chipping a very small piece out of the paint on the corner of the trunk lid.

In hindsight, I would rather have had the very tiny chip because the whole trunk lid had to be painted and readjusted. Now, there is a very, very slight difference in the paint color (a hair darker). Most people wouldn't notice it.

The issue with silver paint (called Brilliant Silver) is that it's hard to match, although the bumper cover seems to match perfectly. It may just be the way that light hits it. On the very brightest sunny days, you can barely tell the paint difference on the trunk lid, but on a cloudy day, I can tell the difference more.

But, I plan on keeping the ""E"" for a very long time because I really like the way it drives and handles (ride could be smoother). I'll get rid of it when I start having problems which was the reason for trading the 560 SEL.

And I see what you mean about the silver paint, too. It can show repairs or neglect pretty readily. The E55 I looked at was also silver, and touch-ups weren't invisible.

I saw a black E430 sport here last weekend...they are a little rare I believe. Very subtle factory bodykit, and I think it had 5 spoke AMG style wheels."

Monday morning, we spent about an hour and a half on the practice track at the Performance Center doing braking and handling exercises and demonstrating the stability control on the skidpad, using BMW's vehicles. I was in a 2006 330iA without the sport package. Great fun! They then gave a very thorough delivery of the car, and fed us lunch. Immediately following lunch, the driving instructor offered a ride in an E39 M5 as he did a couple of hot laps on the track. After that, we took a tour of the factory. We drove home Tuesday. The 325i has an EPA rating of 20/30, but I achieved 31.7 MPG on the trip home, averaging about 60 MPH through the mountains and 75 MPH on the straight interstate, varying the engine speed according to the break-in instructions, and sometimes downshifting to fifth to do so.

The car drives wonderfully. It rides firm, the steering is appropriately weighted, and everything is responsive.

The first pic is inside the Performance Center, just before delivery:

3540	July 14, 2005 9:56PM	andre1969	"I refuse to buy another silver car. It's not that I hate the color or anything, but I've just had enough silver cars. My Intrepid, which is coming up on 6 years with me this November, is silver. My '89 Gran Fury, which I had before that, was silver. My '86 Monte Carlo, which I only had for 3 months, but my Mom bought new, was a 2-tone gray-over-silver (nice combo, though). And my grandma's '85 LeSabre, also bought new and ultimately handed down to me, was the same gray as that on Mom's Monte. So I've been dealing with silvers and grays for damned near 20 years now!

Now I have always liked pale blues and grays that seemed to have just a hint of silver to them. I had an '82 Cutlass Supreme that was ""Jadestone"", kind of a pale silvery bluish green. It had a matching interior, and the dashboard was a contrasting dark jadestone, which was close to the ""magnesium"" color that Chrysler now uses on their 300's, Magnums, and Chargers.

And while 2-tone combos probably wouldn't work well on newer cars, I always thought this two-tone teal frost over teal greeen sunfire St. Regis was particularly fetching. Heck, even the lady in the brochure looks pretty excited about it! :P

Plus it's a really easy color to take care of. Now, I think the bronze/copper color that you see nowadays is gonna look even worse in 5-10 years. Same thing for bug killer blue.
3543	July 15, 2005 12:03AM	ghulet	...silver is a color that will always look OK and will always be fairly easy to sell (unless it does go the way of the greens, but silver is more neutral); my favorite color I ever had on a car was on an old ('86) SAAB, it was called Rose Quartz, it was actually kind of a smoky silver, most were sold with a burgandy interior. Mine always looked clean, and the paint, even after 12 years, hadn't faded.
3544	July 15, 2005 1:16AM	lancerfixer	That C43 is back.
3545	July 15, 2005 2:24AM	cccompson	You're right - Saab's Rose Quartz was a beautiful color (pretty rare too).
3546	July 15, 2005 2:26AM	stickguy	I like the $ on it (the auction). A BIN price only $300 over the minimum opening bid? Why not just make it first bid wins!
3547	July 15, 2005 2:57AM	fintail	If that C43 was a 99 or 00 with the right options and was in my area...I'd be all over it. I'd pay that for a really mint maintained car.
3548	July 15, 2005 12:41PM	andre1969	"I don't think silver really started looking good on most cars until maybe the 80's. I think it's because by that time, most of the chrome was finally stripped off of the cars and replaced by plastic or blacked-out metal, so you had more of a contrast. Also, I guess the paint technology just wasn't as good back in the old days, but most silvers on older cars end up looking like a Coors beer can to me. They just don't have much depth to them, and with all the chrome on them, especially on something like a 50's or 60's car, it just washes out the silver.

Plus, most interior colors are boring these days, so the silver goes well with them. It would be much more clashy with some of the wild interior choices offered back in the day."
3549	July 15, 2005 3:59PM	hammen2	"...not a huge fan of silver. Sure, it never really looks ""dirty"", but to me, it never really looks clean, either. No ""pop"", no ""wow"" factor. Also agree about the champagne/beige/gold non-color color - I keep waiting for that fad to be over.

My wife is a white person.... has been through white Grand Am GT, Lumina LS, Grand Prix GTP, and now Envoy since we met/got married. I hate detailing her car because white shows every imperfection. But, it's what she wants.

Give me a dark blue, black, or, in the case of my GTO, Cosmos Purple Metallic. I spend enough time washing and Zaino'ing that I do keep 'em looking great, and I just love the way a clean dark-colored car looks.

3550	July 15, 2005 6:11PM	ghulet	...it has become super boring, BUT I do remember the first time silver was a 'hot' color (or actually, the first time I think I saw a silver car, period), circa 1978, of course that paint was usually paired with a groovy burgandy vinyl or velour interior, and just as often had a darker silver or charcoal two-tone with the paint (think of the Montes, Cordobas, Regals, GPs of the time). My stepdad had a silver with burgandy vinyl '78 Sunbird (I know, I know, but at least it had a V6, air and a factory cassette, so it was bordering on exotic for my family at the time), it was kinda sexy, especially considering it replaced a $50 '69 Impala four-door hardtop with a super leaky radiator and tied-down trunk.
3551	July 15, 2005 6:35PM	andre1969	"back in the late 70's, silver paired with another color seemed to be a very hot item. I remember that dark blue over silver and burgundy-over silver was pretty common on the downsized Caprice/Impala. Here at work there used to be both a '76 Olds Ninety Eight 4-door hardtop and a '76 Olds Delta 4-door sedan that were silver, with burgundy interiors and a burgundy vinyl top. It was actually a pretty sharp combination, although by the time I was seeing them (early-mid 90's, and I think both were gone by around 2000) the paint was horribly faded.

My Mom's '86 Monte, the dark gray-over silver one, had a burgundy cloth interior. It wasn't an LS, though, so it just had the mouse fur instead of the nicer velour.

I guess the main reason silver has become so boring is just because it seems like it's EVERYWHERE these days! If it was still a bit more rare, and exclusive, maybe I wouldn't be so bored with it.

Ghulet, you might get a kick out of this... http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Chev/1979/index.html
It's a sales brochure for the 1979 Caprice/Impala. They had something like NINE different two-tone combinations, in addition to the myriad of monotones. And something like 5 of those two-tones involved silver or gray!

Here's a link to the '82: http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Chev/1982/index.htm. It's a bit fuzzier and the color's off, so it's hard to tell with some of the two tones, but it looks like they still offered plenty of them, and silver/gray was prominent."
3552	July 15, 2005 8:38PM	corvette	"...was the only ""safe"" metallic color at the time I ordered. I hadn't seen any of the others in person. I can never remember which one is which, but I love either the Mystic Blue or Orient Blue on BMW's--whichever one is less dark. They're offering it on the new 3 starting with the September production. I also love the Bermuda Blue offered on some of the full-size GM trucks for 2005. I also like the medium blue offered on the 1999-2005 Impala, which is similar to a blue color offered on the 1994-1997 F-bodies.

Despite its propensity to show dust, I prefer a black interior after having a grey one. I would only want another ivory or grey interior if the carpet was black."

Zippy is giving me trouble, she stumbled badly while I was trying to pass someone today and yesterday almost stalled when I stopped at a red light. Not sure what's up with my perfect little car..........she will be a year old in 6 days and turned 41k this morning.

3555	July 16, 2005 5:55AM	corvette	"Dad decided to have his TDI Beetle towed to an independent mechanic. We decided to go ahead and have them do the 120k service so that we wouldn't get it back and immediately have to change the oil. I carefully packed the timing belt kit, filters, oil, and parts we removed from the engine, and we waited at home for the tow truck. It arrived as it started to rain. The truck was not a flatbed, as we had been led to believe. For some reason, they wanted to hook the car up in the street, instead of in our (ample) driveway. Long story short, I had not adjusted the seat, and as it was being pushed a decent distance, and I was not able to successfully reach the brake pedal in time to keep it from running over the dolly and impacting the tow truck. Thankfully, no one was standing between the car and the tow truck.

Looks like the bumper will need to be repainted. Yes, it was my fault, and I will pay for it out of pocket, but will add the amount to the final tally for this ordeal when I complain about it, because if it weren't for the crummy timing belt job, this latest incident never would have happened."

( I want seating for at least 6) My ML can seat 7 people.

Volvo wagon
Mercedes E350 or E500 or even the 320 diesel (if they make it).

I don't have any help in my dept other than my closers who just zone nothing more. So its all up to me to keep it running and stocked.

Our store doesn't have many complaints, our store manager is a top notch guy, very well liked. Of course someone was mad at him last week and shot his truck, guess you can't make everyone happy all of the time."
3559	July 16, 2005 10:49PM	anonymousposts	"wagons with seating for 6? They make plenty of them ... they are called mini-vans Seriously, on a smaller scale the Mazda5 seats 6. Although it would be quite a step down from what you are driving now. What about that new MB wagon? The R-Class I think it is. Or a Pilot. Still gets decent MPG on par with most wagons and it seats 8. There are a lot of options .. just depends on what you want.

I would be lying if I said I didn't consider leaving my present employer for a retailer such as Walmart that would be a little closer to home. Walmart was an option because #1 we are 60 miles from Atlanta but our area is fairly rural and it is one of the few places that is open long enough to give me flexibility. I went back to work part-time at first and changed to full-time to get a promotion. When it all comes down to it though I am pretty comfortable where I'm at and I am afraid to leave it for something I won't like as much.

Someone shot his truck? In Alaska? Wow. That's surprising. I guess I have this vision of Alaska as this gorgeous place with lots of snow and no crime. Guess there's crime everywhere though....

So, now that the Focus is giving you trouble what do you have in your sights? A Protege? A Subaru Forester?"

Between the cold, snow, salt, moose attacks, and being shot at, an Alaskan car doesn't have much of a chance...

3561	July 17, 2005 8:28AM	akangl	"You are definatly right there, Alaska does take a toll on the vehicles. Zippy has just over 41k on her and acts at times like she has twice that many. I'm guessing its a fuel problem, the fuel filter (if it has one) has never been changed, so I'm going to check into that this week.

As for the store manager's truck, well, that happens, we actually have a lot of crime up here. Doesn't surprise me at all, I'm just surprised it took a year to happen.

Now for my next car, well, it will probably be a Mazda 3 5-door, I sure like the way they look.

If we get rid of both trucks in the spring and buy a diesel dually we will probably buy a used Ford Escape as well (something for me to run errands in and still have 4WD when I need it in the winter). Zippy won't be replaced for a couple more years I don't think, going to run the 100k warranty out and decide from there.

The RX is very quiet at slow speeds (motor is off). Also, it has electric air conditioning and electric power steering. If you accelerate quickly, the motor kicks in. But, if you are real easy on the accelerator, you can stay ""electric"" at slower speeds.

The diagram on the dash shows what is happening with the system. It shows the underpinnings of the drivetrain, the tires, engine, front and rear electric motors. When you are braking, it indicates that the batteries are being re-charged. The batteries are located under the rear seat.

This car has more horsepower than the regular RX330 which gives it a better 0-60 time.

Interesting car,

Mercedes and Chrysler need to stay way more then an ""arm's length"" apart!

I like Chrysler products... had a '96 and '99 Grand Cherokee Ltd's. I just don't want Mercedes products turning into fancy Chryslers and I have a feeling they are leaning towards that.

I've seen the Honda Pilot/Acura MDX which are SUV's. They are nice.

If I decide go with 7 passenger SUV, I'm leaning towards the Land Rover LR3. The new Mercedes ML is only a five passenger now (no third seat offered).

I know it doesn't mean much in this day of ""employee pricing to everyone"" but your aware we can get discount pricing on all American cars and their associated companies(Jaguar, Saab, Volvo, Land Rover etc) through Wal-Mart benefits. While sometimes even those discounts don't seem like enough it's a good no-dicker place to start.
You probably don't remember but I drive a truck for Wally outta Indiana, while trucking seems a bit slow the stores down here are packed..I expect things will pickup next month when the Christmas stuff starts shipping. 'Course I'm working all I want getting about 65 hours a week :-)

Call me crazy but I'm still not all that inpressed with employee pricing anyway....when they give it to the public then they take most the rebates off, or reduce them greatly. I see little difference in deals now then they where last year.
Makes one wonder the car makers next move..I mean alot of people got spoiled with 0 financing..now employee pricing..what next?? a combination of the two?"

Geez ... I think I was better off when I thought about which car we were going to buy next.

mark156: The LR3 looks nice. I just can't bring myself to shell out that kind of money for something that uses that much gas. It brings me joy to know I am getting 30+ MPG. Even our van gets 25-26 MPG. The recent long-term test in a car mag rated the LR3 at an average of 13.8 MPG. However, we drive about 40,000 miles per year so if you commute/travel less then it probably doesn't bother you as much as it bothers me."

I know a wagon may get closer to 20 mpg's in the city and maybe 25-28 on the road.

My ML500 (big v-8) gets around 20 mpg's on the road. The city mileage is about 13-15.

Although it's out of my price range when new, it's a tempting car no less. I like the styling of it, and they have always been roomy and practical, with good retained value.

That E420 - a one year only model IIRC...is interesting with that mileage...but I would want it to have full maintenance history before even coming near it at that price. There's a chance the car sat around for several years, and that would be a very bad thing. I can get a 01 E 320 with 40K miles or so for in the low 20s, and those cars were upgraded. Id want to knock it down a few grand, and then if it has all records and is as mint mechanically as the miles suggest...then look at it. Maintenance will be a lot more than a normal car."

3584	July 21, 2005 5:16PM	bobw3	Plus I've never been impressed with low mileage cars unless I know the history. I'd rather have a 4 year old car with 100,000 of highway miles than a 9 year old car with 30,000 of city driving. All of the stopping, starting, braking, faster, slower, RPM changes, etc...are what really make cars get old fast, not just mileage. I wish cars would track the total number of RPMs somehow. In my above example, most highway driving at 2000RPM is a lot less painful on the engine than the constant changes between 1500 and 4000RPM.
3585	July 21, 2005 6:33PM	fintail	That's a good point. On that E, I would want a very detailed inspection...specifically examine things like timing chain, fuel injection components, maybe even the valvetrain. It would be a different world from running a Saturn..but not only in bad ways.

I told him he was way better off looking for a private party car in that range. Proteges, Sentras, Cavaliers, that sort of thing. Most were completely hammered.

So, yesterday, on the side of the road, I saw a car that always catches my eye - an early '90s, ""4DSC"" style Nissan Maxima. I've always loved that body style. This one was black, with the spoiler and alloys and looked beautiful. And it had a ""for sale"" sign in the window! I pulled over and started talking with the owner, an older lady who was out working in her garden. As I looked it over, she told me she had owned it since 1994 and was planning on keeping it but her kids convinced her to get a newer car - after she had spent a ton of money fixing it up. She ended up with an Elantra GT, and I could tell she regretted selling the Max.

This is the mythical ""little old lady"" car. We're talking cream puff, in the wrapper, etc. It's a '91 with 132k miles, and other than the body style it could pass for an '01 with 32k miles. In the last year, she's replaced all the belts and hoses (including the timing belt), all 6 fuel injectors, the alternator, battery, struts, powerflushed the transmission, had it aligned, recharged the A/C, and replaced all 4 tires with Michelins. It drives beautifully. She always kept it garaged, and parked way out in the parking lot so it wouldn't get any dings or scratches. The only damage it has ever had was a parking lot incident that required a new grille and driver's side headlight, and if she hadn't told me I wouldn't have known. The rest of the paint is original. The interior is immaculate. She had the ENTIRE seating area professionally covered with sheepskins, including the back seat and the head rests, so the seats are perfect. She even had covers over the dashboard and the rear deck where the speakers are installed. Even the stupid automatic seatbelts work perfectly. Honestly, the biggest flaw I could find on the car was that the in dash clock doesn't work. I called my brother and told him if he didn't buy the car, I would. He lives about an hour away, but he said if I thought it was that nice to buy it and he'd buy it from me.

I got it for the princely sum of $3100. For a super sharp black Maxima SE with automatic, Bose, CD player, cruise, ice cold A/C, moonroof, PW/PL. So little bro got a sweet ride, and I got to scratch the CCB itch...

If you got a great lease rate perhaps, & live near a dealer that will ""pick up & deliver"" when you need repairs, well they are very distinctive vehicles--I still miss the ""look"" & the ""LR vibe"" of my RR.

Then again--Mercedes reliability has gone greatly downhill in recent years. Of all the vehicles you've mentioned, the Acura MDX is a ""no brainer"" IMO.

What about a Toyota? 4Runner, Land Cruiser, Sequoia? I'd kill to have a TLC or LX470 if I could afford it (& owned a chain of gas stations)."

Now that summer is just about over in Alaska, , maybe you can wait for air conditioning on the next car.

By the way, congrats on your promotion

Yes Zippy will be horribly miled up by the time she's retired and waiting for my son (not much longer, lol), but she's a great little car. After a year and 41,800 miles I have nothing but praise for my Focus, never thought I would say that. One of the ONLY cars I've bought that I can honestly say I'd buy again in a heartbeat.

She's starting to need a few things now, tires, brakes (not sure on that one), and a fuel filter. I don't normally keep a car long enough to need its first oil change let alone tires and stuff like that, lol.

Thanks btw, seems like all it did was add more hours to my day, lol. I'm working 12-15 hours/day. Its bedtime for me, have to work tonight."

My uncle's '03 Corolla has around 80-85,000 miles on it now, and he's still on his original brakes. He has a long commute that's mostly highway, although sometimes traffic will get bad and he gets stuck in some stop-n-go.

One of my old supervisors had a '92 Civic, and drove it mostly highway. He got around 150,000 miles out of the front brakes! And when he got rid of the thing at 175,000, it still had its original shoes on the back!"

Whatever I decide to get, I'm going to pay cash for it, don't want a lease or car payments ever again!

I stopped by the Volvo dealer to look at the Volvo wagon and SUV. Both are very nice. For the wagon, I like the Cross Country. I haven't seen one with the third seat up (assuming it has it). I want nav, xenons, heated seats as a minimum. Both the wagon and Suv seemed to be priced at about $42K. And, the gas mileage wasn't too bad... about 18/25 on each (can't remember exactly).

Also, I like the Lexus LX470 but the style is very stale. The GX has that odd swinging backwards tailgate.. won't work. The Toyota LC is also too dated. The MDX is a nice vehicle and could be in the running although I don't care for the front...too short looking. The Honda Pilot looks better and finally, you can get a factory sunroof in the Pilot.

3603	July 23, 2005 8:35PM	corvette	"Mom and I rode up to Lexington yesterday to pick up the TDI from the indie VW shop there. The cause of failure was a locked up timing belt tensioner.

Here is a summary of the problems and approximate costs incurred on this fine piece of Volkswagen engineering over the last 20,000 miles:
101k - new timing belt, tensioner, and 100k service, Neil Huffman Volkswagen - $900
102k - adjust injection pump timing (no cost, but half a day of our time)
105k - new brake lamp switch - $15 plus half an hour of our time
107k - new MXV4's, shipped and installed - $500
113k - oil change - $30 for oil and filter plus half an hour of our time
117k - clean glow plug connections - an hour of our time
117k - rotate wheels - $8
119k - Timing belt self-destructs:
_______ $264 towing to Fast Enough Performance
_______ $350 DieselGeek kit with two-day shipping
_______ $455 Fast Enough bill
_______ $350 repair and repaint bumper
_______ $100 oil, fuel, pollen, and air filters we supplied
Total costs - $2972 in the past six months and 20,000 miles. I am including the body repair cost because it never would have happened if the car did not first experience a mechanical failure.

This doesn't account for our time fixing stuff, ordering parts, or ferrying it to a repair shop. Dad wants to keep it (Q: What else could possibly go wrong?), I'm unconvinced (A: Plenty!). Just like our last VW, I would not be comfortable selling this car to a private party, and I think if I showed them the repair records, the extra money one typically gets when selling PP would evaporate.

Regardless, I think our family has owned its last Volkswagen, and I am really glad I didn't buy an Audi A3."

They also had a low mileage 01 S430 with AMG trim, in a blue similar to my 300SE. But the price was also about 10-15K above what I see similar cars elsewhere.

We did go to the largest Honda dealer in the area yesterday looking for a 2005 Element AWD 5-speed but they only had about 7 Elements in stock.

I drove that car from 100K to 200K and would not have sold it then. But Anony lived 2 hours away. It topped out at about 80mph on the floor. It there was a stiff headwind it would barely do 65. It would deliver the heck out of a pizza though.

My second favorite car was a 1987 Honda Civic Wagon. I found if in the autotrader. Broken timing belt, a brick in the windshield, and black primer over biege paint job. Looked like it had eyebrows where the primer had peeled away from above the headlights. Paid $550 for it. No engine damage after installing a new belt, and a new windshield. I loved that car. Installed the (very rare) accessory rear speaker pods, tinted the windows, and a set of 15"" Borbet wheels. Those wheels are a story to themselves.

We drove that car to Canada, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, etc. COLD a/c. I mean smoke from the mouth cold.

Now we are just spoiled. But if Honda still made those speaker pods, I'd still drive an old wagon like that. Maybe I'll have to settle with the Element. I don't fit the Mazda5."

I learned to drive stick on an '85 Civic sedan, that was such a great car. Great in the snow, very easy to shift, handled pretty well, got like 35 mpg in the city IIRC, had tons of room for such a small car (interior AND trunk), and unlike many Hondas during and even after that era, you didn't feel like you were sitting in a sunken bathtub. Dammit, if only those had fuel injection and you could find one not held together with bondo and a prayer, I swear I'd want one right now. I remember thinking they were radical (in that they were among the first 'tall sedans') when they came out, but the beauty is really in the execution.
3628	July 27, 2005 6:06AM	akangl	"Almost in the market for a new vehicle after today. We came VERY close to getting hit towing the travel trailer home from Montana Creek tonight (spur of the moment fishing trip). Some guy in a Ford Festiva lost control and headed right for the TT. He got it back just before he clobbered the front corner of the TT. We were thinking ""here we go, hang on"", he missed by inches and not many at that.

Then we got home and turned on the turn signal, slowed down to make the turn into our driveway (left hand turn) and some moron starts passing us on the left. Hubby swerved at him and forced him over, that's twice in a row that's happened. Must be something about an RV that pushes the stupid buttons on other drivers, lol.

Unless something strange happens (like the above doesn't miss) we are going to pay off the Dodge and Zippy in the spring plus pay about 1/2 on the Titan and refinance it so we can buy it out of the lease. Then just keep them all, seems stupid to go further into debt just to get a different truck."
3629	July 27, 2005 11:58AM	andre1969	"I had a '91 Civic rental car, and it was the first small car I ever drove that finally gave me any shred of appreciation for them. For one thing, I could actually fit comfortably in it! I don't know what's happened to small cars over the years, but somehow, while they've gotten much bigger since those days, very few of them today can fit me as comfortably as that '91 Civic did. Now admittedly, the back seat was almost non-existent, but I'd rather have a car that sacrifices the back for the driver's comfort, than one that makes a compromise. After all, if the driver can't get comfortable, isn't the car useless?

This one had like 100 or 110 hp, with a 4-speed automatic. In long acceleration runs, like what you'd need to merge onto a highway, it was pretty scary, and it really didn't seem too happy to run above 70-80 mph, unless you downshifted manually on level ground and punched it, got it up to around 85, and then shifted back into 4th. But it was a fun little car to toss around town and the suburbs and such. And, out on the highway, once you got it past that little 70-80 sticking point, if you had enough of a level/downhill stretch, it would get on up to 110-115 mph.

Still, as likeable as that car was, it felt soooo good to get back home, and slip behind the wheel of a car with a bit more guts to it, and a bit more sheetmetal around me! Still, sometimes I've wondered if I could ever get used to a little car like that on a daily basis. Sadly though, about the only modern little cars I feel comfortable in are the Neon, Madza3, and, marginally, the Corolla. And they're a lot less little than that Civic was!"

The RAV4 was a good commuter but it was a 5-speed and I dealt with a lot of traffic. The Vigor was the spider condo at the time."

And the reason to lease a LR, instead of buying, at least for a new one, is the terrible depreciation. But if I had a zillion bucks & could throw away $$ on cars, I'd probably be out looking at a new Range Rover Sport, I think it's called.

Ironically, at the time I almost bought a brand new MDX instead of the 2 1/2 yr. old RR, for only $2K more. Because of my then ""LR obsession"". A truly dumb decision.

The Pilot sounds like a really sensible choice. IMO the MDX looks more expensive (& it is), & ""upscale"", but that's just me.

I was deprived of the convenience and safety of a four-door sedan for four months, and come to find out, it would have been perfect for Dad to replace his Beetle TDI with it. He could have had it cheaper than a new Civic. The lower fuel mileage would have been offset by the fact that it required practically no maintenance or repairs. It had new Michelin tires and new front brakes, as well.

My own advice to him was that he should fix and sell the Beetle immediately, and drive the Canyon until the 2006 Civic comes out. If he is still driving 40-50,000 miles per year at that point, strongly consider the Civic."

Of course, 200HP and a 6 speed will make me overlook a few minor inconsistancies. And my wife won't know that I did it until the deed is done.

So much for keeping the miles down on the L300! Ironically, it has 41K miles, as much as Zippy has put on in one year ... except I bought the L300 in the middle of November 2002.

Now I'm really thinking about what to do next. The only reason I didn't have a problem with the daughter driving the L300 was that she was only putting on maybe 50-75 miles per week between work, school and home. Looks like that number will be trebling, if not more, with the new job.

If I'm not able to save 20% or so of my net income, I will be anxious. Right now I save a lot more, with no car payment and low expenses.

The tricks my friend is using now is a ploy to make the old car seem old and tired. He even used the ""borrowed time"" line Shifty has used for high mileage cars. He also ranked on it for having only one airbag.

When I bought the 126, I lowballed with 50% of their asking price, and the offer they took was about 70%. So in theory, it could work. This is the place where the dealer said he wanted my 126 too, so that could be interesting. Maybe Saturday or Sunday we'll see."

But somehow...I have a new (well, new to me) car itch."
3646	July 30, 2005 8:30PM	fintail	"Well, I didn't even make an offer. I looked at it and sat in it...and I just got a bad vibe from it. Maybe it's a self-defense mechanism not wanting me to have a car payment. But anyway, I didn't even make an offer.

However, they did have another similar car, with a sport package (bodykit and wheels). I noticed it's online two, with three vastly different prices between their sticker, autotrader, and mbusa.com. I sent an email asking what's what, and told them what I'd be willing to pay. Maybe they'll even bother to reply.

I visited a high end dealer who has a 02 S500 with the sport package. The miles were a little high (58K), but condition was reasonable, and the price wasn't bad. I'd like a lower mileage car though."

There were not one, not two, but three separate people talking excitedly about it on their cell phones. Bet that one manages to sell this weekend unless it has some major hidden defect like a bad crash.

3649	July 31, 2005 12:28PM	anonymousposts	Gee wants one. A Sports Sedan with the manual. Hard to find around here though.
3650	July 31, 2005 4:21PM	fintail	Maybe you could have one shipped in. I know the dealer in Seattle had a few dozen of them last time I was there, some must have been manuals. I think that car has had most of the bugs worked out now...so they might not be the worst thing..
3651	July 31, 2005 10:07PM	fintail	"Today I went and drove that S430 I lowballed them on. Impressive speed compared to my 126, and so many amenities (ventilated seats!), but honestly, I didn't notice it being a lot quieter or smoother than my 126. Maybe that's a statement about how nice my car is, or how little things have changed in the structure of big luxobarges.

I knew they'd they'd offer nothing for a trade, but I had them look the 126 over, just for the hell of it. They offered $2800. You can imagine I laughed. I can see where they are coming from...this lot has nothing older than MY 01 and almost nothing under 20K...so they'd have to dump it somewhere.

I have an old friend who heard about me looking at newer cars...and he said he'd be interested in the 126, and would be more than willing to give 5K for it, which is my bottom line. He's a car guy, and he'd take care of it. That's important to me, I want it to go to a good home.. He wants something to keep his fiance from buying a big SUV.

My biggest beef with the newer car is that it doesn't have xenons. A fairly loaded S430 - sport package, ventilated seats, headlamp wash, etc...and no xenons? The dealer was unwilling to take this into effect when negotiating...but it's a big deal to me.

So after my friend takes the 126 out for a drive..I might make a move. They have to give me something for the lack of xenons, which will cost about $1500-2000 to retrofit, as far as I can tell."
3652	July 31, 2005 10:17PM	nippononly	you'd go to the trouble and THAT MUCH expense to retrofit the xenons? You've been just fine without them this long......
3653	July 31, 2005 10:26PM	fintail	"I drove the fintail for 7 years with no AC, power nothing, no ABS, no airbag, etc too.

It's a big deal to me, I think they look cool. If I'm spending this much on this nice a car, I want it to be as close to perfect as can be. I'll certainly account for it in my offer price. They've had the car (in their showroom no less, it's that clean) for 90 days...sooner or later they'll want it out of there."
3654	August 1, 2005 1:41AM	mark156	"Fin.... I have the xenons on ML500 but I don't on the E430 sport. Honestly, I would never replace the headlights on the ""E""... $2,000 is a lot of money to put into a depreciating car.

A friend of mine has a 2001 S500... the air conditioners on my ML and the E are much better than on the S. Somehow, the S's air conditioning is not that strong. Actually, I have three close friends who have the S-class and they have commented on the air not being that strong.. One of the guys, has traded for a BMW 7 series because of the bad local Mercedes dealer service. This friend just picked up his second BMW... a 2006 7series with the sport package. Hopefully, I'll get to drive it soon.

Beware of the electrical problems on the S-class.... my friend who has the 2001, has had the ""computer key"" just go out and has to order a new one. Also, the wiring harness was replaced at 25,000 (Everything stopped working) he has 48,000 on it now and is ready to trade. He's eye-balling the new 2006 Bentley Continental Flying Spur! Can't wait to test drive that!

3655	August 1, 2005 2:39AM	fintail	"Yeah, the depreciating bit is a good point. I've seen sets on ebay for

The car is CPO and has a 1 year warranty...I'd probably buy a longer one depending on price. I've seen a lot of negativity about these cars on edmunds forums, but less on other MB centered forums.

It rarely gets too hot here...I can deal with the AC in my 126, and the newer car I drove seemed to be a lot more effective in this regard.

I just suddenly feel like I need a newer car. The 126 is getting old (was new when I was in grade 7)...it needs a few things (suspension upgrades, rear window is delaminating), and it's not like it's a collectible. It still runs well aside from a glitch here and there, mainly the hard starting when hot. All acceptable for a car with 182K on it for most people."
3656	August 1, 2005 6:11AM	mark156	"182K is a lot of miles for ""even"" a Mercedes especially a gas model. My air conditioning worked perfectly on my 1991 560SEL... Maybe the newest S-classes have better air than the 2000 and 2001. Of course, the new 2007 S-class will be coming soon and, hopefully, will not have the glitches as the previous S-classes have had.

I'm thinking strongly that my next car/suv will not be a Mercedes because of the lack of reliability. I've had 3 in a row and I just want to try something different.

3657	August 1, 2005 3:40PM	andre1969	if the tranny were to go out on your 126, how much would a replacement cost? A few years back, a buddy of mine bought a '73 or '74 450SL for his wife. It had something like 180K miles on it. I think they had it for about a year or two, then sold it for about half of what they paid for it. The tranny soon went out on the new owner, and I heard it was something like $3,000! I have no idea what the car was really worth, but my buddy paid like $15K for it, and sold it for around $7-8K.
3658	August 1, 2005 4:30PM	fintail	"Yeah, I know 182K is 'borrowed time' as some would say. I think this car has life left in it though. My friend came by and drove it last night. He couldn't get used to the second gear start...the pedal was too heavy for him, and he'd downshift it from red lights and then let up, making a jarring ride. His normal car is a 1985 Monte Carlo SS, it goes 15mph at idle and has a very light throttle. It took him awhile to get used to the car not being geared for acceleration, as well. After a few miles he was OK. He did say it seems like an amazing car for 5K...so it's nice to have a potential buyer lined up when I do get the right deal on the right car.

It's funny...my previous 2 cars have been MB, and my next one will most likely be. There's just something about how they drive. That S430, with the sport package, handled amazingly well for a yacht of its size. At 70 the engine is barely working. I'd really like an AMG car more, but it's hard to find one that hasn't been driven hard, and they make so relatively few anyway, that there aren't many good ones for sale. I'm used to the expensive maintenance now. I also only drive around 8K miles a year, so it's not such a big thing for me.

I think if the 126 puked a tranny, I could get a used one and have a specialist insteall it for 1500 total, maybe. I don't know what a rebuild would run, maybe twice that. 126 transmissions are pretty durable though, I haven't seen many failures, and I've never seen a fintail with a bad tranny. MB hasn't been too bad in that area, as long as the car is maintained. I think some early 140 S-class cars (early 90s) had problems however."
3659	August 1, 2005 5:35PM	ghulet	....if my mom's 300E is any indication (it does, after all, have the same engine and transmission, right? It's an '88), 182k really isn't too much for that drivetrain, if you take care of it. I know mom has put a fair amount of money into the car, but I'm almost certain she hasn't had the engine or transmission rebuilt. The odometer broke on the car about three years ago (maybe even four?) with just over 300k. She has literally been all over the country several times in it (lives in Indiana, been to Yosemite, Tennessee many times, Virginia several times, Arizona, Chicago many times, I think Florida once) since then, so it definitely has over 350k, probably more like 375-400k. My mom isn't exactly a leadfoot, and the car is garage kept, has an excellent regular mechanic (apparently) and before she moved to Indy it was dealer maintained in St. Louis, but she doesn't exactly baby it, either (and my stepdad hit a cow in it once).
3660	August 1, 2005 6:51PM	fintail	Yep, same powertrain, and I have seen a few of this engine (M103) at over 300K. It's a pretty robust engine. The engine and transmission in my car are excellent...practically no oil consumption, and the tranny works smooth and accurate.
3661	August 1, 2005 11:20PM	corvette	"I didn't check the xenon option on the order sheet. The big problem that I have with nearly every car is the range on the low-beams (high-beams are usually great), and the xenon might have helped there. The low-beams in every car I regularly drive are just scary if you're driving on the interstate at night (and there's always an oncoming car, so you can't use the brights). I'm sure it has something to do with our outdated lighting standards in the US.

I thought the Volvo V50 I drove (non-xenon) had particularly bad headlights, however. Also notable were the small mirrors and the very noisy electronic steering column lock. Other than that, it was kind of a neat car."
3662	August 2, 2005 12:51AM	fintail	"I agree about the low beams...I put Euro-spec lights on my 126, and they make a HUGE difference. I don't understand why our lighting standards were so dumbed down for so long. I think things have equalized pretty much now.

I got an email today from a dealer who claims he should be getting in a C32 soon. We'll see what happens with that. I think I will probably hold off now on a car til that comes in, or the end of the month, when there seems to be more room for negotiation, unless I really become impulsive."

Too bad... that will push wagon buyers to Volvo.

3664	August 3, 2005 11:50PM	ghulet	.........I peered into a newish E-sedan today and it looked less roomy (actually the whole car looks smaller: lower, shorter and the trunk looks smaller, though I don't know if that's actually the case) than the previous E-class. The back seat looked like it had about as much legroom as my mom's 300E. All in all, the car just looks less substantial somehow; it doesn't look like a $50-70k car to me any more. Put one side to side against an Accord V6 and there isn't much difference to me, visually.
3665	August 4, 2005 1:02AM	fintail	"I checked insurance quotes today....unbelievably a 02 S430 is significantly more to insure than a 02 or 03 C32 or a 03 E500.

I like those E wagons, they are very good looking. An E55 wagon would be an awesome beast.

I think those E class impressions show how much the premium-mainstream class has improved since 1986"

3667	August 4, 2005 8:24PM	woodyww	I haven't followed all the details of this, but you're buying a Mercedes S-class with only one year of warranty left? You're gonna need the $2 grand you want to spend on the Xenons for the first tune-up on this baby, let alone for things that might go wrong. Have you thought of a used Acura or Lexus? Buying an almost-out-of warranty S-class is not for the faint of heart (or wallet).....
3668	August 4, 2005 10:15PM	fintail	"I'm just contemplating things...no decisions

It would have 2 years left (1 factory, 1 CPO), and I would purchase more warranty. It sure is a pretty car though.

I like driving a nice driving larger car...and the LS is frankly just too ugly, and the new RL is out of my price range, while the old one is just too boring.

I'm also contemplating looking at a C32AMG, as I was thinking about a C43, but a good one of those that meets my condition and feature requirements is impossible to find.

I now drive an S class that has been out of warranty for 11 or so years...and it's not so bad. Maintenance is expensive compared to a Corolla or a Malibu, but it sure drives nice."

3674	August 5, 2005 7:14PM	andre1969	the more I look at the Skyy, the more I'm starting to like it. Normally I don't like oversized, peeled-back headlights on cars, but somehow they seem to work on the Saturn!
3675	August 5, 2005 7:17PM	jbollt	...coming to? A Saturn sports car? Next you are going to tell me that Porsche is making an SUV!
3676	August 5, 2005 7:18PM	robr2	"...or a 4 dr sedan?

Oops - they are."
3677	August 5, 2005 7:26PM	michaellno	"Yeah, when I first heard about this, I was pretty happy. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the one thing that makes a Saturn a Saturn -- polymer panels.

I know, I know, the Relay minivan doesn't either, but polymer was one of the main reasons why I bought two Saturns in the past 3 years.

It will be interesting to see how they position the SKY versus the Solstice. The Solstice starts at $20K, but has a number of option packages that move the price north pretty quickly. I've heard rumors that the SKY will start at about $25K, which leads me to believe that it will have the optional Solstice packages as standard.

177HP, quick throw 5-speed tranny, RWD. Looks like the MX-5 (RIP ""Miata"" nameplate) might have some competition.

I've got my hopes up."
3678	August 5, 2005 10:41PM	cti	"My wife and I now own four cars. We had zero cars three and a half years ago while we were still dating.

First was a 2000 Kia Sephia purchased in June 2002. It was my wife's money so I had little say. She liked the bright blue color. Turns out the car has a salvaged title. Ran well (for a Kia) until about a month ago. The car doesn't start. Turn the key, makes noise, but doesn't start. Otherwise no out of the ordinary problems.

Next was a 2003 New Beetle purchased by my wife. I got the Kia and the payments on it. My wife and I are in the Navy and she was moving to Hawaii and needed a car of her own. She always wanted a Beetle. A base model with no options. Quite nice for a base model. No headroom in the back. No problems at all with the car.

Feb. 2005 I purchased a Mazda3 hatch after mounting frustration with the crappiness of my Kia. The Kia was cheap, but really bland. Sadly, the Kia hadn't been paid off yet (3 year loan) and I could have put the money to better use. Love the car. Zoom zoom!

Loaded it up with every option so I wouldn't be tempted to get rid of it early. It has xenons and I really like them.

August 2005 (last week) - I hadn't seen my wife since March and we were on vacation together visitng her parents in Michigan. Her father aided and abetted her CCB status by showing her a 1966 Beetle. An hour later she bought it. I make fun of her for owning a car older than she is (by one year).

She overpaid but she is happy. But, since she lives in Hawaii, she will hardly ever get to see it.

3679	August 6, 2005 4:49AM	mark156	"Fin, I think you are putting too much importance on the xenons... if the car that you find doesn't have them, I don't see the big deal if everything else is to your liking. Regular headlights are yellow, xenons are blue.... Honestly, I have both and don't really see that much difference... So, what I'm saying is, is the lack of zenons would not make me turn down a car. Mileage, exterior condition, interior condition would be at the top of my list vs. xenons.

Mark"
3680	August 6, 2005 4:30PM	fintail	"The way I see it...I'm going to have the car at least 4 or 5 years, so I might as well have it exactly as I want it. Like with the 126...I bought it and then hunted down Euro lights and chrome wheels...because that's what I wanted from the start.

I wouldn't turn down a car if the rest was perfect, but I would make sure the features I desire can be retrofitted. Luckily, it seems a xenon retrofit is not difficult. On the W220 S class, it is simple plug 'n play with the old lights, and then setting the computer to recognize the xenons. Not so bad.

I won't turn down a 10K mile mint car for a 100K mile used car just because it lacks a certain headlight style."

I got the 126 soon after I finished college...now I've been on my own and am stable and working for the same company for 4 years, and I just have an itch for something new. I don't have the cash to buy a new car outright, but I can easily finance just about anything that I like.
I've been pretty responsible with my money, and can handle it. The 126 all of a sudden just feels old. It was made when I was 12.

Funny thing...I went to the dealer to tell the guy I was going to pass on that S430...it sold yesterday. I think that's a sign it wasn't meant to be. They have nothing else that interests me, save for a woefully overpriced 03 E500 sport. The dealer there did ask if I still wanted to sell the 126 though...he thinks his brother wants to buy it.

I then went on a little drive, and stopped at a high end used dealer, who always has lots of Ferraris, Lambos, Maseratis, etc. A guy there I've talked to before has a bugeye E55 he wants me to see, but the miles are too high for me (over 100K). This guy also liked the 126...he had to look it over and sit in it. I guess it's good knowing the current car won't be hard to sell...if I can bring myself to part with it."

It took us a while to work through the problems with the Titan and now its awesome.

I just can't stomach buying another vehicle. I can honestly say after having 3 car payments I'm VERY tired of car payments. I'd rather pay these off and not buy another one until we can pay cash. A lot has happened recently to bring me to this reality.

The Titan is 9 months old, Zippy is a year old, and we've had the Dodge for just shy of 2 years."

Of course, it's also possible to take a bath paying cash for a lousy vehicle, as I proved a few years ago buying a used Range Rover, & trading it a year later right before the warranty ran out.

Grbeck, Lemko, and I went to a car show in PA, and in the car corral there was this '73 Toronado sitting there, forlorn and just crying out to me, with ""$800 or best offer"" written on piece of paper taped to the window.

This is another one of those cars from my childhood, like the Mopar R-body, '76-77 LeMans, '75 LeSabre, '67 Pontiac, etc that I've always had a fascination with. I sat in it, and surprisingly it wasn't that bad. Had kind of an off-white/ivory interior that needed a good cleaning, but wasn't bad overall. Brown dash pad, with, suprisingly, no cracks. Power seat still worked fine. Exterior color was kind of a grayish-brown color. I couldn't find any real body damage/rust, but it had been re-painted, needed a lot of rubber trim/seals/etc, and some of the plastic trim around the 5mph bumpers was missing. And the cover for the fuel filler, which was hinged, wouldn't close all the way, like the spring was messed up.

I didn't get to start it up, so God only knows how well this thing ran, but it was pretty tempting. But, if I ended up bringing home every car I was ever fascinated with as a child, I'd end up with a junkyard! Plus, I'm already in the process of getting a 4-car garage built (got the permit from the county on Wednesday...YAY!!! :shades: ) so I'm not ready to start building another just yet!"

Asking price was $8200. Now if it didn't sell 3 years ago at $7500 or whatever, why does the guy think it'll sell for MORE now?! :confuse:

They're basically just big, old, slow tanks.

Andre, I don't think you would have been too happy with that Toro, though at $800 you'd at least have an inexpensive and fairly unusual conversation piece! Those are horrible gas hogs and they eat tires for lunch.

3691	August 8, 2005 1:42PM	qbrozen	"need to reduce my overall fleet? Well... a little person is in the works. I've got some time to ponder what I'm going to do, and nothing is definite (well, we're definitely pregnant ... but the car situation is the indefinite part). But, I'm wondering ... how does it count towards CCB status if you sell 3 cars and buy 1?

Here's the rundown:
The wife's Pilot is perfect for the job and a child was even part of the reason for buying it. The current Volvo S70 is also great for the job ... but with 110K miles and almost 8 years under its belt ... well, it's not just that, but if I need to give up the 350Z and the Alfa ... it all becomes so confusing.

The whole idea is to try to cut back on the expenses. I'm only paying on the Z, but also paying for insurance on all 3 hurts, too. SO, my thinking is that I sell all 3 and buy one younger sedan in order to cut my payments in half AND reduce my insurance quite a bit. Could I sell the Z and Alfa and have NO payments ... yes ... but I guess I'm just worried that the Volvo will not always reliably get me to work each day ... not that its ever failed me before, but I guess its that mental 100K mile barrier coming in to play .... ugh. Anyway, just getting this all off my chest and out in the open ... maybe folks have some ideas I haven't thought of. That is, if I haven't been too confusing."
3692	August 8, 2005 2:14PM	anonymousposts	"That is if you are happy with all of your cars. The Pilot will be the main baby carrier and you have the Volvo for back-up. If you love the Z then keep it. It will never be the family car but you could use it to get to work and back if the Volvo fails you.

Of course if you wanted a new car anyways this is the perfect excuse to get one. There are some great deals right now on G35 sedans."
3693	August 8, 2005 2:15PM	kattdaddy	I have located this automobile not knowing much about it,if I could get some info like values number of autos manufactured are they good investments etc. It appears that all parts are there and the body is pretty solid.
3694	August 8, 2005 2:37PM	trucker50	"if the car manufacturers will ever be able to get back to conventional pricing now that John Q. has got a taste of employee pricing. I know zero financing spoiled alot of people, I've had friends tell me they where waiting to buy till it comes back..the local Honda dealer is offering it now.
People with legitimate access to employee pricing are paying more for cars this year then last because rebates are virtually non-exsistent or slashed greatly."
3695	August 8, 2005 2:37PM	qbrozen	"G35 would definitely be a consideration. Along with an S60 T5. Maybe take a look at the Lincoln LS and Caddy CTS, too. All can be had darn cheap on the used side.

IF I can leave it as is, I will. But, like I said, between the Z payments and insurance for all the cars, I could save quite a bit by consolidating to one newer sedan."
3696	August 8, 2005 2:40PM	andre1969	"was a pretty good period for Chrysler. Many historians consider that the era when Chrysler started to wrest design leadership away from GM. They were good looking, cleanly styled cars. One disadvantage to the Windsor is that it doesn't have the Hemi. That year's Windsor was a 301 CID ""poly-head"" V-8 that put out around 200 hp. Only the New Yorker got the 331 Hemi, while the C-300 got the high-output 331 Hemi.

I believe Windsor Deluxe is a dress up package for the Windsor, which probably gave it a nicer interior and more trim. And I think ""Nassau"" is what they called the 2-door hardtop.

I have no idea about investment/value/etc. As for number produced, I think Chrysler built about 150,000 units total in 1955, but I'd have to look the exact breakdown up in one of my books when I get home."
3697	August 8, 2005 3:45PM	michaellno	"Should I just succumb?

Wife has given me permission to trade in the Focus for what I want. Of course, what I want and what I can afford are two completely separate issues.

I want either a Saturn Sky when they are released next year or a new Mustang convertible (V6, either manual or auto). Either one will run about $25 large.

What I can afford is about $300-400 per month. Could either lease or buy - wife says I ought to lease since I can switch cars more often. In that vein, I've been thinking about either an Accord Coupe (EX w/ 5-speed) or a Scion tC.

However, I'd really like to look at getting something where the top goes down. A used TT might fit the bill.

Wife, OTOH, would really like to get a Thunderbird. But, the prices for used ones are still pretty high, IMO. That, plus they don't get great mileage and this would be my primary commuter car (40 miles r/t each day after the office moves in September).

Help!"
3698	August 8, 2005 5:02PM	anonymousposts	I am extremely biased but I think the Accord EX 5-speed is a great car with incredible lease deals right now. You can also sign and drive on a G35 for $399 a month plus tax. If you want a convertible your options are limited as far as new cars go for less than $400 per month but you could probably get a PT Cruiser convertible or a Miata.
3699	August 8, 2005 5:24PM	stickguy	"does that $399 a month go for a 6 speed too? With any options?

Not a bad sounding deal....."

---SLAP!---

What's wrong with you? Keep the Alfa, fercryinoutloud! I barely made it 2 years sans Spider before I had to buy another one. If you end up doing all this car switching and end up without something to use as a ""fun"" car or ""date"" car you're going to hate it. It's really nice having a car that lets you pretend to be free and kidless, even if it is only for a couple hours while the munchkin is at Grandma's.

3702	August 8, 2005 6:25PM	qbrozen	"thanks for the slap. haha.

of course, yer probably both right. the only reason its even a consideration now is because i haven't driven the Alfa in quite some time ... but that's because I have the Z. So if I sold the Z ...."

Of course, we plan on having one or two more, so push that out another few years. And mine are girls, so I'm a bit hesitant about booting them out the door right on their 18th birthday, so add a few more years yet.

Nah. I think I'll try and have something fun in the meantime. Our minivan is very nice, and even kinda fun as far as minivans go, but it ain't no Alfa. Part of the fun of a ragtop is seeing everybody look at you, so might as well have it while we still look so darn good!

I wouldn't mind a TSX as a daily driver, but I don't think any Acura shy of the NSX is frivolous enough to be a full fledged toy.

3705	August 8, 2005 8:38PM	corvette	Do you have the collector car/pleasure use only insurance on the Alfa? If you drive it less than 4,000 miles per year, it might lower your expenses.

But, it does change the dynamics of what you need to drive once the kids get their own licenses and cars.

The wife's VUE is the vehicle we would use for most errand running, which is why I think I'm in the market for some sort of toy, or, at the very least, a coupe of some sort. Don't need to use the back seats too often, but would like to have the versatility of a hatch for golf clubs."
3707	August 8, 2005 8:53PM	qbrozen	"I've tried. I've talked to other people about it and they've told me they have had it for vaious cars, but I've talked to my insurance a couple of times about it and, while they tell me its listed as ""pleasure use"", I'm still paying a good bit for it.

I've also tried to get insurance through .... oh, I think its called Haggerty's?? While, according to the rules that were on their website at the time, my car qualified, when I actually tried to get a quote, they told me it didn't. I argued, but to no avail. I believe they changed the info on their website since then. The Alfa is coming up on its 20-year birthday soon ... so I'll look into specialty insurance again at that time."

My crazy idea is to keep the Alfa & the Volvo, & sell the 350Z. That would raise the most $$, I presume (?), & if you get a good price, you can always buy a used Z. FWIW, my ex had a '95 Volvo 850, bought it used, ran it up to well over 100K miles, & only repairs were a new radiator & a $1200 A/C job. Real solid car.

*That is, if I haven't been too confusing.*"

Let's see, Zippy is 13 months old and will soon turn 44k, still a great little car. I figure by the time she is 2 years old she will be pushing 90k miles.........OUCH! I doubt you will run as many miles as I do...........I'm the queen of high mileage!"
3712	August 10, 2005 1:40PM	qbrozen	"Ouch. I don't like that suggestion.

That leaves me with 2 high-mileage cars and the one with the stick is SLOW (alfa). Its ok, by the way. Cut out and welded in all new floorpans a couple of years back. Had the body and paint done up real nice just last winter. Runs well. Just needs ALOT of help in the interior department.

I think, fairly, the Alfa is about a $4K-$4500 car. The volvo isn't far behind. I think $5K. I owe $19K on the Z and its about a $24K sell (probably more if I held out, but I'm lowballing). So, really, all cars are pretty close in what they'd actually fetch me in the cash department.

I saw a NICE S60 T5 5-speed on Ebay very recently (just ended last night, I think) with a buy it now of $18,9. I was drooling over it. BUT, its all the way down in Florida.

The wife is insisting we will make the Z work for us. She see's how sad I am when I talk about getting rid of it. We'll see what happens. If work keeps going well, I'll be due for a raise in December .... so it could still all work out."
3713	August 10, 2005 1:58PM	anonymousposts	Why not keep the 350. Sell the Alfa and the Volvo (presumably the most repair-prone of the three) and get yourself a nice late model Japanese sedan. Maybe a 95-98 Camry, 96-99 Accord, or maybe even a 95-99 Maxima. All are relatively safe sedans that could do back-up duty as a family car and would be great commuters to keep miles off of the 350Z. There are also some amazing lease deals on Altima's right now. You can sign and drive for 259 per month for 24 months. If you don't put a lot of miles on your car that would give you a new, safe sedan under warranty for about $6200 + insurance for the two years.
3714	August 10, 2005 2:06PM	qbrozen	"but that doesn't lower my payments and barely lowers my insurance. So, as a financial solution, that one doesn't work.

I certainly trust the Volvo to do backup duty. Actually, it does MOST of the duties at this point, keeping miles off both the Pilot and Z. Yes, I've had to put money into the Volvo, but I don't think anything out of the ordinary given its age and mileage. I'm confident it will keep going for a while, just not confident that I won't have to lay it up now and again."
3715	August 10, 2005 2:11PM	kyfdx	"Since we are all living your life...

1) Sell the 350Z and the Volvo.. keep the Alfa for fun.. Plenty of money then, to buy whatever sedan you want..

OR

2) anony has a good plan... get rid of the Volvo and Alfa... Lease a nice basic sedan... You can get an Accord LX for 3yr/36K for $240/mo, tax included with nothing upfront but first payment and license.. This will keep the mileage low on the 350Z... The only bad part to this plan, is you will have more in monthly payments than you do now.. .. though, it may save money in the long run..

regards,
kyfdx"
3716	August 10, 2005 2:17PM	anonymousposts	you will have about $10,000 to pocket. Your monthly payments go up but you have more cash flow. Also, leasing a new Accord/Camry/Altima will give you two modern cars with good-to-excellent crash tests. I think the Accord and Camry are almost equal with both being ahead of the Altima. They will get great gas mileage and you don't have to worry about expensive repairs which are a possibility on the Volvo as it goes past the 100,000 mile mark.
3717	August 10, 2005 2:34PM	qbrozen	"well, that's an interesting way to look at it. $10K in the pocket ...

BUT, leasing is out. It would raise my insurance across the board because it requires me to raise my limits on all the cars. I've been through that before. BUT, maybe I'd have to give the insurance company a call... that was a long time ago and i have raised some of my limits anyway, on my own.

Gas savings could be another interesting angle. The volvo has gone downhill lately (down to 23 mpg average). Amazing that the Z is getting 2 mpg BETTER!

Hmmmm.... something like a Protege might make a good economical commuter and still leave me with $3K cash or so to make Z payments with.... but maybe a Protege isn't big enough for baby baggage? I really have no clue about any of this."
3718	August 10, 2005 2:39PM	kyfdx	"The Protege sedan has a lot more interior room than you would think... Almost comparable to the last generation Accord...

If you get an ES model with a manual tranny, they are also a blast to drive.. 16"" BBS wheels standard...

3719	August 10, 2005 2:54PM	zodiac2004	"If your goal is to lower monthly payments you have to replace the cars you are making monthly payments on, don't you?

How many cars do you really need? You currently have a 350Z and a Pilot(both of which you are presumably making payments on) and a Volvo and Alfa. Do you need 4 cars. Evaluating needs/wants is the first thing that needs to be done here. And what do you hope to achieve ? Is more cash in the bank/lower monthly payments/ a combination of both/something more fun than what you have ?"
3720	August 10, 2005 2:57PM	anonymousposts	"at the insurance cost of leasing. We have 4 cars with full coverage + uninsured motorist coverage. We pay $1000 every 6 months and the Lexus is $500 of that. The Odyssey is leased and it's the cheapest of the 4.

We had a 2001 Protege ES 5-speed. It was a great car for driving around town but became a bit high-strung and buzzy on the highway. It handled well, was reliable, and got OK gas mileage (around 28 MPG on average). Only problem we had was the death rattle in the engine when cold which was pretty commonplace for the 2001's with the 2.0L."
3721	August 10, 2005 2:59PM	qbrozen	"Do you need 4 cars?

Do you realize what board you are on?? LOL!!

Lower monthly output of money. This can presumably be done by having less than 4 cars, for one, and, yes, lowering payments. The Pilot is going nowhere. That's the family vehicle and wife wants nothing to do with a minivan. That leaves the Z. HOWEVER, this new line of thought presented here would allow some leftover cash, which could be used towards Z payments."
3722	August 10, 2005 3:01PM	qbrozen	You OBVIOUSLY don't live in NJ.
3723	August 10, 2005 3:02PM	guss	"If I may jump in I have two word for you G35 Coupe(or is that three).

Same car as the 350 but you get a backseat. You'll have to test it for rear facing infant seats work. But, trust me on this , you will rarely have the baby in their for the first year.

After that, Junior or Juniorette can hop in the back themselves.

This only works if you want something similar to the 350. If you are looking to change to something totally different than go for the Volvo S60 and be the family guy for awhile.

My experience comes from having 3 kids in 4 years. Went from the Jetta 1.8t to an Olds Aurora, to a Durango, to Mazda6 wagon. Probably should have just kept the Jetta for the number of times in the past 6 years where I had to carry all 3 plus the wife. But what fun would that have been. Sometime you need a big juicy rationalization to get thru the day.

Good luck on your choice and congratulations on the little one."
3724	August 10, 2005 3:04PM	anonymousposts	yesterday when we were contemplating Gee's G35 obsession of late. We are 16 months into the lease on the Odyssey. The dealer payoff on it is $23,000. I've seen them go for $21,400-$22,400 trade-in where I work. That means we could theoretically dump the Odyssey now. I was quite surprised at the small amount of negative equity. Of course we have to evaulate the logic in paying $1000 to get out of it and not getting to use it or spending $3300 (including insurance) to continue driving it for another 8 months and just buying the G35 next year.
3725	August 10, 2005 3:07PM	qbrozen	giving up a minivan for a sedan? or is it the coupe? Can you get by without the minivan? If so, I say GO FOR IT! Heck, someone needs to counterbalance what I might have to do and trade to something LESS practical.
3726	August 10, 2005 3:09PM	qbrozen	"thanks, guss.

The g35 coupe is too expensive at this point.

The sedan, on the other hand, is a consideration. Or was. I think I'm really taking a liking to this latest line of thinking. Anything to keep my Z."
3727	August 10, 2005 3:10PM	lemmer	"Keep me posted on any clever ideas with this. We are 15 months into our Odyssey lease, and I am always looking for a way to get something new.

My wife thought surely we could keep a vehicle for a 24 month lease, but I am not so sure."
3728	August 10, 2005 3:16PM	anonymousposts	"we aren't driving it nearly as much now as we were when we first had little Gee. We were allowed 24,000 miles and with 8 months left we still have another 10,000 miles of use left. Honestly, the Accord is more than enough car now that we don't have to carry the heavy-duty stroller around in the trunk. Gee has even put the car seat in his Si recently and we used that as the family car for the weekend. So, yes, we can get by without the mini-van.

We never really considered getting rid of it until Gee started seriously considering thinking about possibly wanting the G35. Only thing holding us back is we don't want three car payments. So if we do decide to bite the bullet this is our plan.

Sell the LS to Gee's Mom for $6500. Use that $6500 to pay the Si off and keep driving it as the commuter/mile car. Trade the Odyssey in and do a sign and drive on the G35 to see if Gee likes it enough to keep it. I like the idea of a lease on more expensive cars because if someone hits it you are not stuck with a $30,000 car that's been repaired/repainted. You can drive it till the end of the lease and send it packing with no extra money out of pocket.

Only kicker is gas recently went up to $2.39 for regular and the G35 requires premium and only gets 1 MPG on the highway better than the Odyssey. OTOH, if Gee is going to buy a high performance gas-guzzler he better do it now while gas is still under $3.00 a gallon."

3730	August 10, 2005 3:22PM	woodyww	"Yes. I thought after my last post, that it sounds like, of the 3, you really want to keep the Z. Now I have 2 plans:

1. Keep the Z (I think anon. said this?), & sell the Alfa ---I don't get the impression it turns you on all that much. And either sell the Volvo, or keep--you don't need collision or comp. on it do you?

2. Sell all 3, & buy a nice used S60 T5 5-speed. Personally, that would probably turn me on more than the Z, plus it's ""practical"". And maybe try to keep the older Volvo if possible.

Maybe--can you decide on one to definitely sell? Like the Alfa? Instead of making all decisions at once? Just my 2 cents, good luck."

You're right about it being a 4-4.5k car, as I sold my very decent Quad with a couple of minor needs for just under $4k a little over 2 years ago. Seems a shame to part with it, when you can't have spent too much less than $4k for body work and paint.

As for the fact that it's slow? Well, not much you can do about that on a Bosch Spider. My '74 isn't a 350Z by any stretch of the imagination, but it's quick enough to be fun. Makes my '87 seem like the slug that it was - albeit a great looking, sweet handling slug. Once I get around to rebuilding my spare motor - I already have a set of hi-comp pistons and liners - it should be a real gas.

3734	August 10, 2005 5:35PM	qbrozen	"I'm not quite on the wrong side of it just yet. I really don't even remember what I've spent on parts since I've had the car for about 6 years or so, I think. Bought the car for $2K. The floorpans were maybe $500 or so? My father and I did the labor. The bodywork and paint was CHEAP. Not that its a cheap job, by any means. But its nice to have connections. It sort of became a pet project for a business associate of my father's. Took him about 5 months to complete in his spare time at his body shop ... but, all in all, he took the whole car down to bare metal... fixed all problem areas with new metal ... and painted the whole thing. Charged me $800!!! (I gave him $1K, though.)

let's see... new top for ~$350. Miscellaneous Ebay stuff here and there. I don't know... maybe I'm right around $4K or so into it, I suppose, not including my own blood and sweat (and my father's). But, hey, not bad to break even on a car after having enjoyed it for so many years.

I think its more sentimental than anything. Its probably not likely that I'd get to have another project car with my father. Ugh. Writing this is definitely making me have my doubts."

I'm figuring a full tank of gas, disconnect the battery, toss a car cover over it and it should be fine. Makes me sad to park my baby, but $$$ wise its not a bad idea.

3737	August 11, 2005 2:14AM	stickguy	I would think that you couldn't do that with a lease (take the insurance off it).
3738	August 11, 2005 4:32AM	corvette	"I don't think you can completely drop the insurance with a lease. You might be able to explain the situation to the lease company and, with their permission, keep only some type of ""not being driven"" policy that covers damage to the truck from environmental hazards. Failing that, call your insurance company and tell them that you want to keep the minimum coverage required by the lease, but you expect to drive the car *0* miles in the next 10 months. With either scenario you may need to make a change to the insurance before you can drive it back to return it at the end of the lease.

As for storage, inflate the tires to the maximum pressure on the sidewall to prevent flat-spotting, and it wouldn't hurt to add some Sta-bil to the gas tank before filling it up. If you remove the battery, you may want to charge it (not sure how often, probably depends on the storage temperature). If you have a car cover, use it, but I wouldn't go out and buy one for a car I was planning on turning in at the end of the lease.

Sorry to hear of your troubles. Hope everything works out!"

3740	August 11, 2005 1:33PM	anonymousposts	I agree with the others here. It's probably going to be impossible to drop the insurance on the Titan while it's financed or leased. Could you sell the Dodge and drive the Focus and Titan?
3741	August 11, 2005 1:51PM	mark156	"Wow, looks like there has been a major turn in events! Sorry to hear.

First, I would never store the Titan as you stated.

It will be right there in your driveway the whole time anyway. Just start it twice a week bringing the engine to operating temperature and keep the the gas fresh. That way, the battery will stay charged and all of the bearings/moving parts will stay 'greased'. Also, run the air conditoning during your starting event to keep the compressor oiled.

From what I'm reading in your post, you will still be making the payments; the insurance may go down a little but you will still have the Titan in your driveway. It will probably cost more to empty the fluids and then put them back during the next 10 months vs. just leaving things they way they are and just start it twice a week.

I have an antique car that I keep in the garage at my second home. The mechanic said, ideally, have the car started twice a week when I'm not there (which can be a month or two at a time). Actually, I have it started once a week and everything has been fine for the eight years I've had it.

I wish you the best of luck Jolie,

3743	August 11, 2005 6:59PM	mark156	"Wai, I keep my antique fully registered and fully insured because I drive about 600 miles a year to my car club meetings and outings.

My understanding is that you don't need to keep the registration on the your Honda current if you are going to store it. I would be leery of not carrying insurance though, just in case something happened to the car. Three years is a long time for a car to sit. I would prepare it correctly if you are seriously wanting to keep in storage that long.

Also, you can ask your insurance person to see if a minimum would be required if your home insurance is not valid for your car. If your house or the storage facility were to catch on fire, would your car be covered.

Mark"
3744	August 11, 2005 8:20PM	wai	Thanks for your tip, Mark, Will do.
3745	August 11, 2005 9:08PM	gouldn	Just thinking out loud here ... if it costs $500/month, and you're gonna store it for 10 months ... that's $5000 + reg and minimal insurance ... how upside down are you? Would it be cheaper just to turn it in?
3746	August 11, 2005 9:27PM	andre1969	"how much land do you have? One thing I've done, when I had cars that were un-tagged and unregistered, but still running, would be to just drive them around in the yard (or, at the time, my grandma's yard) a little bit. That way, I'd get a chance to run them and get things circulating.

I really need to get my DeSoto out and running, though. I put it in my grandma's garage about a year and a half ago, but then to get the Catalina to fit in there (I was in the process of renovating and selling my condo, so I lost one garage space) I had to jack up the DeSoto and slide it over towards the wall, so it won't clear the door opening anymore.

When it comes time to dig it out, I'll have to jack it up and slide it back out. Somehow I have a feeling that it's not going to be as easy coming out as it was going in! :surprise:

I have started it regularly though...so far so good. And while I can't move it, I've shifted the tranny through the gears, just to make sure each one engages when I push the button. I can't wait till I finally get my garage built! I got the permit last week, and hopefully they'll start within the next few weeks. I know my grandma will be glad to get my cars out of her garage!"
3747	August 12, 2005 2:16AM	akangl	"A minimium of $642/mo in just the payment, right now the insurance is around $700/ 6 mos, not sure how much it will go down if I can drop it to just comprehensive (might have to keep collision on there too, not sure). Then there's gas........which is about $100/mo (we hardly drive the truck as it is), and oil changes plus whatever else. I'm thinking it will save us maybe $150-$200/mo to park it and right now that makes a HUGE difference. As far as how upside down am I? Well, trade in wise I was around $7k the last I knew, retail probably about $5k or so.

Unfortunatly we can't sell the Dodge, need it for firewood deliveries and its our business truck. Can't sell Zippy since I need her to drive back and forth to work. The Titan is no more than a toy, same as the travel trailer. Another few months and things will be ok I think. Just have to get through right now.

PS.........THIS SUCKS!!!!"
3748	August 12, 2005 4:13PM	woodyww	"I dunno.....I think I agree with gouldn on this. Maybe I'm missing something:

You're having some kind of financial bind. But you pay $642/mo for a truck you hardly ever drive & is ""no more than a toy"". Just the parking is $200 a month(?). With ins., you're up to almost $1000 a month for a toy, is that right? Unless you're a 2 Yuppie couple with 2 huge incomes, or multi-millionaires, that's a staggering amount to ""blow"" on a car.

I think I know from your posts how much you love this truck. I'd love to have a brand new Porsche, & then if I had to sell it, it would be difficult. If I were you, I'd outline all this for Terry on RRTIV--see what he says. I don't mean to be critical here: I'm just taken aback thinking about spending that much on a car, any car--$1000 a month is still a house payment in some places. (Not in E. Mass.!) But good luck whatever you do!"
3749	August 12, 2005 4:18PM	gouldn	"I think I may still may be confused ... if you're willing to pay over $700 not to use an asset for 10 months ... that's $7000 ... and if you're only $7K upside down ... wouldn't it make sense to turn it it?

However I know as well as the next perosn the attachment to a car ... especially after the saga of finally getting it all sorted out.

Best of luck whatever you decide!"
3750	August 12, 2005 4:54PM	akangl	"The main purpose of the truck is to tow our travel trailer. Its also our family vehicle, like today we will drive it, but it definatly doesn't go out much. If you look at the mileage on our vehicles, Zippy has 44k at 13 months old, the Dodge we've had for almost 2 years and have put 21k on it (for a total of 34k on the truck), and the Titan has 16k at 9 months old, so for us the Titan isn't driven all that much.........5k of those miles were towing. Insurance is about $117/mo I think for the truck, so yes, its expensive to keep it.

We have a very good income, however, our pinch right now is the business and the skidder, neither doing as they are supposed to. Our projected income this summer declined sharply, from the usual $10k (from the business) to about $1k. It will get better, but not until around December.

If I had the extra $$$, I would probably sell the truck. However, come spring we would have to jump right back into buying another truck to tow the travel trailer with. Seems silly to dump a truck that we will need and then have to spend $$$ to get another truck. If our Dodge was an extended cab this wouldn't be an issue at ALL..........we wouldn't have the Titan!"
3751	August 12, 2005 5:44PM	zodiac2004	"sell the Titan privately, pay off the lease, and when you do want to take out the trailer, tow it with the Dodge and also take the Focus for the people.

This may sound anti-CCBA but it makes no sense to keep around a vehicle as expensive as the Titan if it's main purpose is to tow around a trailer for about 5K miles a year, especially when you have a truck already perfectly capable of doing so and when you are in a money crunch.

(I can be very smart when it comes to decisions about other people's money. Maybe I should be a financial advisor :confuse: )"
3752	August 12, 2005 6:16PM	anonymousposts	Maybe the best thing to do would be to take out a low-interest credit card and use that to pay the insurance until things stabilize. Reducing the insurance probably wouldn't work with NMAC and it might open the door to even more costly circumstances.Then you might want to consider selling the Titan (if possible) and trading in the Dodge for a crew cab heavy duty truck. That way your outgoing expenses would be under your base income amount.
3753	August 12, 2005 7:21PM	woodyww	"I kind of thought, based on your previous posts about this truck, that you'd probably do about anything to keep it. (It's like ""car addict psychology""--if shrinks & academics were smart, they'd add that to college curriculums).

The thing is: if you don't have $5-$7K laying around to get out of it, how can you rationalize $1K a month to keep it? It's like: Variable Income: +or- Gigantic Car Payments=What????

The other thing is: You don't ""need"" a $650 a month truck to tow a travel trailer. An old Suburban for a few thousand $$ would do that.

If you were talking about a C5 or C6 'Vette, or Porsche 911, I'd probably start rationalizing along with you about keeping it, that's how bad I am. But I'm sensing the need for an ""Intervention"" here. Seriously--at least ""consider"" what people here are saying about it(?). I mean, it's August, & you can't part with a truck that costs a fortune, & you won't even use again until next Spring, & you're having an economic downturn??.....Sorry if I'm being too blunt......"
3754	August 12, 2005 8:27PM	mark156	"Hey, wait a minute Jolie........ why don't you sell the Dodge and let hubby use the Titan for his work? I'm not sure if you said if the Dodge was paid for, but either way, you'll either save the payment on the Dodge to put towards the higher payment on the Titan or if the Dodge is paid for, you will have expendable cash to help your short term cash flow.

And, you say you don't drive the Titan much? 16,000 miles in 9 months? SOMEBODY is driving the Titan!! My 2000 E430 Sport only has 29,800 miles and my 2002 ML500 has 44,000. ------------- that Titan is not sitting in the yard very long for sure!

As for selling the Dodge and using the Titan for business..........yeah right! The Titan can't pull our 12,000 lb firewood trailer or haul nearly 2 cords of firewood in the bed. In a word........it won't work (or it would die trying)!

We've spent so much this summer trying to get the skidder going (and buying it), far more than we made with the business this year. It hurts after a while. In 4 more months we will have $1k/mo in loans paid off and things will ease up. The skidder should be up and going by then so it should be MAKING money instead of COSTING us money.

The stress right now is pretty bad, we are cutting any corner we can find. Lessons learned though.........I don't want car payments anymore! The 3 vehicles we have are the 3 we will keep and pay off."
3759	August 13, 2005 4:11PM	woodyww	"Thanks for tolerating my rants about selling your Titan--(it's easy to give advice to others). It came out of my own expense-cutting crusade, & selling off 2 beautiful vehicles that I loved in the past few years in order to save $$ & be more ""practical"".

He said this time we will just cut corners in other ways and not sell anything..........other than maybe my stocks to cover some expenses. I think he's right and its going to be ok eventually.

I do know that I don't want car payments after this and 2 of the vehicles will be paid off in the spring with the 3rd shortly there after. Winter is our best time for $$$, so I just keep hoping the snow will fall early this year."
3761	August 13, 2005 10:16PM	fintail	"Well.....anyone want an immaculate W126 300SE?

I bought the C43. The car was as-advertised...a 1 owner 54K mile car sold new at the local MB dealer, traded in by a 65 year old man on a new 7 series.

The car doesn't have a ding on it. There are a couple of parking/bumper scratches the dealer is having removed, along with refinishing the wheels because they have light curb rash. The car drives quick and tight, and is a blast merging onto a highway, really feels like a muscle car.

The dealer is having the cosmetics done and also throwing in a set of new tires - which aren't cheap for those big AMG wheels. I paid just about book for it, but it's a car you really can't go by book price with. They just got it in last week, and hadn't even put it on their lot yet, as it hadn't been detailed when I drove it. I moved on it, as I had a feeling it would sell. It's a lot of car for 19K.

I really don't want to sell my current car, but I won't be able to do it justice, as I have one garage spot, and I wouldn't get to drive it much. It makes me sad, but I must do what is best for the car."

With all the great rebates, etc, what is the best deal that I can get on a vehicle right now? I would also like something that gets fairly good gas mileage and I don't want to spend more than $20K. I've leased in the past but not sure if this is the best route to go. Also, is it true that the end of the month is when I can work the best deal? Any tips, tricks, advice from all you serious car shoppers would be appreciated! I live in the upper midwest.

I think the C43 will retain some value, moreso than a normal car.

The bizarre interior was only offered on C43 and E55 cars...so maybe it is rare, enough to make a story at selling time.

Sharp looking car and I think the two tone leather looks OK. Expect to change the tires every 20,000 miles. My Michelin Pilots are getting a little noisy with 9,000 miles but I still have another 10,000 miles to go before I change them out.

3774	August 14, 2005 5:16PM	fintail	"A thought crossed my mind to dye the steering wheel black...but I doubt I will. It is probably the oddest part.

I am 6'1"" and I fit fine, although I do have the seat all the way back. But I do that in my 126 as well, and that car has room for just about any driver. I like to kind of stretch out as I drive.

The C43 is a 98, one of 570 sold that year IIRC. So I probably won't run up beside myself at a stoplight. Yep, it has heated seats, and just about everything else. The only options were the CD changer and xenons, which is also has. It also has a dealer installed (I guess) phone, which is this archaic analog thing that tucks away in the lidded console.

The seller/dealer I bought it from is having new OEM (I would have guessed Michelin but the spare is a Continental) tires put on it before I take delivery, probably sometime next week. I know those wheels and the sporty suspension of the car will eat tires...but I only do around 7K miles a year anyway, so it won't be so bad. I can't wait to get it and give it a good detailing. And I've got 3 bites on the 126 from craigslist so far, so that's cool. I don't want to have to store it outside for long.

I'm also going to have a transmission service done before I start driving it, as that is about the only problem area with those cars, un-maintained transmissions."

Now just 3 years later, I'm trying to talk myself into or out of trading it on a new Acura TSX. If I can do the deal I want (and some people in these forums seem able to get), I'd still have the same payment, but it still just seems to fall short in the long-term fiscal responsibility area.

Fiscal responsibility or not, that 6-speed is ""like buttah!""

I'm like that....I bought my 126 thinking I'd have it forever, or until it became impractical to use as a driver. But lately...it has just seemed so old and stodgy and...old. I saw an ad for one calling it an ""analog car in a digital world"", and that summed it up. It's a lovely car to drive and nice to look at, but there's little fun quotient.

Ronsteve: How old are you? You've got the rest of your life to be fiscally responsible. If your heart is yearning for the TSX and your wallet won't be crying afterwards then go for it.

3783	August 15, 2005 8:22AM	ronsteve	"If I came in here, I must have been looking for people to talk me into trading my Accord on a TSX...

For those who asked... I'm in my mid-30s, divorced, no kids. Currently owe just under $10K on the Accord, and the dealer pseudo-appraised it just north of $13K. We'll see how well that holds up. If I can get the TSX out for between $26K and 26,5 plus TTL, I'm very tempted. If they won't get to those numbers, that's fine... I still like my Accord.

If I did a deal, payments would be VERY similar... other ownership costs would go up but by too small a margin for me to really miss it. The difference comes into play 2 years down the road, when instead of having my Accord paid for, I'll have 3 years to go on the TSX. Then again, I'm not sure how soon I'd be looking into a different ride after that anyway!"

That's one nice thing about Honda products, the depreciation is usually low enough that you can trade at any point in the loan cycle without having negative equity.

The TSX is a great car that will probably give you years of faitful service. Besides, it is a four door so it's automatically more practical than your Accord Coupe.

I debate over whether I should go for something like this or spend my 20Kish on something new/practical, especially with gas prices now! I really don't want to deal with problems/repairs, especially on an out of waranty expensive to fix car.

With my fairly low mileage driven, and experience with MB, I had no problem spending my almost-20K on that car. It gets no worse mileage than my 126, and with the miles on it, it will likely cost no more to maintain. As long as it's been taken care of, the cars are known for very few problems - and by everything I can see, the car has been cared for. The AMG cars seem to have a different build quality than normal MB, and in 98 things hadn't gone so bad yet either.

Later this morning the 126 goes in for inspection, as the guy who drove it last night really liked it. I hope it passes...so I can have it out the door when I get the C43, and because I think the guy will take care of it, and he lives about 50 miles away, so I won't have to see it!"

It shifted his front bumper to the left about 6 inches or so, so it stuck out menacingly, waiting to snag the unwary.

Well, on his way to court for that accident, he got sideswiped by a small SUV like a Pathfinder or 4-runner (this was back around 1995 or earlier, back when they WERE small SUVs) Well, because the Cordoba was so low-slung and those SUVs sat up so high, he gouged out its side pretty good.

He got paid for the car, twice in fact, I think, but kept driving it. Then one day the security people at his college told him he couldn't bring it on the campus anymore, citing it as being dangerous to drive, so he got rid of it. I forget how, exactly, he got rid of it, but he did say that he saw it some time later, abandoned on the side of the road, with no tags and all beat to hell.

His second car was a '78 Newport 4-door hardtop. He t-boned a '90-93 generation Accord sedan with it at an intersection, and the resulting mass rolled up over a curb. Both cars were totaled. The Accord, because, well, it was destroyed, and the Newport, really because it damaged the rear axle when it hopped the curb, more than anything the Accord did to it! :surprise:

His third car was an '82 Cutlass Supreme sedan. It actually served him pretty well for a few years, and was well into the 150-160,000 mile range when he decided he wanted a newer car. So he traded it for a '95 Grand Marquis, in the summer of '99. Got like $600 in trade for the Cutlass. And, some time later, he saw it dead along the road, with the windows busted out. One way he could identify it was that he had 3 wheels with Olds wire hubcaps, and one wheel on the back that was a Chevy rally wheel that was pretty common on Malibus, Monte Carlos, and S-10 pickups back in the 80s'."

I see tons of cars like that every day, but never heard of the security people complaining. Sounds like he was unlucky!

I've never sold or traded one of my cars locally, but I have seen a navy blue 1990 Park Avenue Ultra running around my hometown. I'm almost certain it's the car my grandmother used to own, but didn't know it was still around. Back then, the Ultra was rare relative to the plain Park Avenue. I remember it had seats that were adjustable a zillion different ways, with a fluorescent-backlit display for the controls that folded out from the center console, just for the various lumbar supports and the headrests. It also had the fake convertible top and an alarm that falsed whenever the remote keyless entry was used, and no airbag, so it had the cheesy seatbelts on the doors."
3796	August 15, 2005 6:07PM	andre1969	"my old 1980 Malibu about a year after I sold it. Followed it into the parking lot of a shopping plaza, in fact. I stopped and talked a bit to the lady who was driving it, and she said they loved it. I sold it with 100,000 miles on it, and they had around 115,000. Only thing they had to put into it was a new headliner.

When I sold my wrecked and semi-stripped 1969 Dart GT to the junkyard, they kept it around for about a year, maybe a little more. It was kinda sad seeing it end up like that, but at the same time, I did like the fact that every time I saw it, there was a little more stripped off, so at least it was going to good use, and helping keep other Darts on the road. Then, one day I went in the yard, and it was gone, finally sent off to the crusher.

One thing that's kinda cool though, is that they had an aerial photo taken of the junkyard while my Dart was in it, and have a big pic of it hanging up on the wall. So if you look really, really close, you can see my sahara beige GT, immortalized forever on film! :shades:"

3798	August 15, 2005 7:47PM	nippononly	"a couple of weeks back - went to the Safeway, which is in a big parking lot with Rite Aid and lots of stores. Two different cars ""formerly of Stuart"" were there, an '89 Tercel and my old '88 Integra. The Tercel I sold years ago, maybe around early '99, with 150K on it. The Integra I sold early this year with 255K on it. Both apparently still chugging, although the Tercel looked pretty beaten up. Cracked windshield, bald tires, seat vinyl shot. Current plates though.

The Integra was pretty much as I had left it, except the guy buffed out the paint, so that it looked a little BETTER than when I had it. It had the original tape player when I had it, which barely worked (but got news radio, so I was happy) - he had traded it out for a Sony CD.

I still see my old Subie OBS regularly too - that looks just the same, still belongs to the lady I sold it to four years ago. Had about 115K on it at the time, wonder what the mileage is today."
3799	August 15, 2005 7:57PM	woodyww	"A few years ago, in a fit of expense cutting, I sold a beautiful 15 y.o. German car, one that many car freaks still lust after. Not only could I not bear to see it again, I can't even bear to say what it was here, cause it's still bugging me. Plus I sold it too cheap, for an ultra quick sale, as it had needed $4 grand of suspension repairs, etc. for a few years, & for just a summer car, the maintenance, ins, etc. started driving me crazy. However it was gorgeous inside & out, + low miles.

Anyway, when the guy I sold it to for a bargain price drove away, I saw him lighting up a cigarette--in the car. I wish I had just sent it to an auction, like Barrett-Jackson (sp?); whatever it brought, it would have been less personal. Not only do I not want to see the car, I don't even want to see nice versions of it--fortunately they're pretty scarce....."

I wish them all the luck in the world, and offered to answer any technical questions, as I have a good deal of experience doing minor repairs on the A4 platform Jetta/Beetle cars.

Dad's Beetle is at the body shop now, having the bumper resprayed. He isn't keen on trading it, and he has the Canyon and a motorcycle to drive if it fails him again, so I guess he won't be without transportation if it has a relapse..."

I picked up a 78 Chevy Impala last month from a friend for free (I gave him $100 for the new hubcaps he bought for it). It only has 99000kms (about 60k miles) and I'm the third owner. He only had it for 3 months.

Then since I was putting more money in my 93 Civic Si :sick: doing the clutch and radiator, I got tired of it and got sold it and got myself a new 05 Civic a week ago. :shades:

When the price is below $10k you can get the trade credit money and find a buyer more easily on a lower priced car. The price to sell in on my own is usually $1,000 to $1500 over the dealer trade number. So own a $5k car that credit difference is not as big as on a $12,000 car.

Either way it ain't cheap unless you buy at the right price to begin with and try not to move too far up in vehicle value."

Dealer takes car in trade [and reduces your sales tax accordingly} and SIMALTANESLY sells your trade car to your buyer for the price that you & he agreed to beforehand. Naturally the trade-in $ figure and the Sale $ to the buyer are the same......another benefit to you, since it is higher than wholesale. Dealers HATE to do courtesy trades because they make 00.00 money and it involves more paperwork...but they will, to get the new car sale.

3833	August 17, 2005 2:02PM	lemmer	"I wrote a long reply to this yesterday, but the lightning knocked out the power before I could post it. The story goes like this:

An old lady at my Dad's church passed away. Her family decided her car was not worth the trouble of trying to sell (now that I have thought about it a little more, I think it was a '63 or '64). They offered it to me if I would clear it out of the carport. I, of course, jumped at the chance even though I had no use for the car. It was 100% original, but sitting on four flat tires with a dead battery. With a new battery, some judicious use of carb cleaner, four rotted and leaking bias ply tires pumped full of air, and various other cobweb fighting, I drove the car five miles to my Dad's house.

Over time I tuned it up pretty well and found a matching set of used Uniroyal Tiger Paws (it is hard to find really tall 14"" tires nowadays). It had a 361 big block, a push-button transmission, and something like a 2.38 rear end. I would drive it up and down the road next to my Dad's house on the weekends, but not too far as it had a leaking heating core, and not too fast as the brakes were no longer capable of stopping the car. (Does anyone remember in ""Fletch"" when he keeps stopping that huge Cadillac by running into stuff? The brakes were about like that.)

I thought I was going to keep it as a cool weekend hooptie, but my trusted mechanic (and big American iron fan) told me I was crazy. The entire braking system needed to be replaced as all the lines were rotted. He said if I fixed the brakes and started driving the car, I would end up systematically replacing everything mechanical on the car as it was all atrophied from misuse. To add to these problems, my Dad was not happy about having it in his yard. When I finished graduate school, it went to a junkyard.

Bonuses with the car - it came with the original owner's manual and a yardstick in the trunk that had printed on it ""1958 Chevy - Lower, Longer, Wider"" along with the name of a local Chevy dealer. I still have both of those."
3834	August 17, 2005 3:08PM	volvodan1	I don't know many that would do it. Maybe with a longtime customer a dealer may consider it.
3835	August 17, 2005 3:43PM	billherrmann	"Mark: I positively HAVE done this. In the sales contract the Dealer puts in BOLD Print 'Dealer makes NO Warrenty , either Expressed or Implied as to the Condition of this car' NO DEALER WARRENTY WHATSOEVER. I will point out,
however, that recent discussions w/dealers indicates that dealers want to charge
[someone] $200. to do the paperwork. Bill H."
3836	August 17, 2005 3:50PM	volvodan1	No Warranty doesn't necessarily mean No Liability.
3837	August 17, 2005 4:47PM	fintail	I think the sale of my 126 will be something like that courtesy trade - but I am not buying from the same place. I have a very interested party right now - the brother of the finance manager at the local MB dealer. I took the car to the dealer to be inspected after the guy drove it (I guess he can have it inspected for free - and the old beast had surprisingly few repairs needed) and the finance manager guy said he wants to run the sale through him, as somehow it would benefit me. I am not sure how...but as long as I get the money I seek for it, I am happy.
3838	August 17, 2005 6:57PM	mark156	"Liability is what the major concern is. Maybe a few dealers will chime in and give their take on taking courtesy trades.

Mark"
3839	August 17, 2005 7:06PM	woodyww	Yes, you could live in NH (that's the only state I know of w/no sales tax). I've actually thought of moving there, partly for that reason. But the property taxes in NH are nuts.....someone who bought expensive cars frequently could make out, however.
3840	August 17, 2005 7:10PM	lemmer	"At my dealership we call it ""stealing"" and we don't do it at all.

It's really skirting the law to the point most dealers won't do them.

.... Hmmm, how can I say this ... It's a, no, no I can't say that, it's aah, aaah no, no I don't want say that .. uummm' let's just say, there is some possible potential maybe some problems that Al Capone had to deal with ... If ya know what I mean ...

Uncle would see that and it would want him/her to dig deeper. No dealer wants that ( not even for a quick couple of hundred for just paperwork).

Search ""courtesy trade"" and you can find the whole discussion."
3841	August 17, 2005 8:30PM	lancerfixer	As a former NH resident, I can say that it's true; there is no sales tax. There is, however, a pretty hefty registration fee due to the municipality you live in, based on age and value of the car.
3842	August 17, 2005 10:54PM	corvette	"My Dart, DeSoto, and Catalina are on an antique policy, and are only around $180 per year for all three, WITH an agreed-value collision/comprehensive coverage!

That's really cheap! How many miles per year does the policy allow?"
3843	August 17, 2005 11:24PM	fintail	"I have a ""storage policy"" on the fintail...it's liability only or something like that, and I just call them when I drive it. It's like $3/month. I think I'm SOL if I crash it though.

I found a buyer for the 126 today, so I'll be back at 2 cars as of the weekend. Should have the C43 Friday."
3844	August 18, 2005 12:37AM	andre1969	"I'd have to look at the policy to double check, but I don't think there is a set mileage limit. All they care about is that you have a car on a regular insurance policy that you use to drive to work/school/etc. As long as I use the antique cars for stuff like going to car shows and club events, driving around on the weekends, or even just driving it around on a nice day, they don't care. I have driven my cars to work on occasion...for instance, I drove the Catalina today because the weather was so nice.

They understand that you have to drive a car every once in awhile to ""stretch its legs"". Also, one reason that it's so cheap is that they only charge me once for liability, no matter how many cars I have. So basically I pay for liability, and then with the cars it's something like $6.00 for every $1,000 of agreed value."
3845	August 18, 2005 4:14AM	lancerfixer	Belated congrats on the C43. It's a shame I wasn't closer; I've always loved the pics of your 126...probably would have begged Mrs. Lance for the funding.
3846	August 18, 2005 4:21AM	akangl	"I bow to anony........holy cow, I thought I was bad!! I can't see a new car being anywhere in our near future, so I'm living through you guys! As far as sales tax here, we don't have any on cars......or much else for that matter, only in certain areas in Alaska.

Zippy cost me $$ yesterday, course it was really my fault. I kept thinking the Goodyear Eagles would last another 6k........they are running way close to the wear idicators, so I ignored the fact the car was pulling to the left (figured an alignment that could wait) and the fact that the car was shaking violently (figured the tires were just wore out).

Yesterday morning I drove to work at my usual nutty pace (80-90 mph) and arrived safely (if I had only known what I would see 12 hours later). Hubby came in later with the Titan to get parts for the cursed skidder, so I told him I'd drive the Titan home (it IS mine after all). I mentioned that he needed to be careful of Zippy (he rarely drives her) since she was shaking badly.

Right about then I had a gut feeling to look at the driver's side front tire. Ran my hand over it and it seemed ok........gut feeling said NO, LOOK at the tire. Bent down and looked at it, I was beyond stunned. Got on the phone to the used tire place and managed to get 2 used tires put on for $50 right at closing time. The guy said there was NO way the tire would have made it home. Zippy had eaten through the inside half of the tire, through tread, rubber, steel belts, and into the nylon. My brother looked at it and with a little pressure could have put his finger through the tire, the wear showed up on the inside as well.

Zippy is better now, still shaking some, but no more pulling. She has an appt on Monday for an alignment and front end check. She's still not right, very over reactive on the steering. Not her fault though, twice a day through road construction and gravel has beaten that poor car up badly.

Talk about a reality check! I figure my guardian angels were flying overtime yesterday morning!"
3847	August 18, 2005 6:52AM	ghulet	"....glad you avoided the inevitable, even an 'easy' blow out is a pain (changing the tire unexpectedly, usually in the rain or when you're in a hurry), let alone a dangerous one at 80-90 mph! Good call, looking at that tire before you left.

Tires are a strange thing, my S.O. has the original tires on his Jeep Wrangler @52k, though they need replacing, but that's a different animal on different terrain (prolly never been off-road, city potholes mostly and occasional highway use) and beefier tires, so no surprise there."
3848	August 18, 2005 12:58PM	andre1969	"at my Intrepid last night that I was starting to think that it was new car time. I changed the oil on it, and when the drain plug went back in, it never did fully grip. Oil pan's stripped...damn, they just don't make 'em like they used to! :mad: In the old days, it was the plug that usually stripped, and you could just go buy a new one for a buck or two. But nowadays, of course, they make the EXPENSIVE part be the one that strips!

I was also kind of a bad boy, and let the oil go too long since its last change. Normally I like to do it every 3,000 miles, although I've been stretching it occasionally. Well, this last interval...over 5,000! I guess that trip to Florida, plus a few trips to Pennsylvania, plus general running around added up quicker than I thought! And considering that the Mopar 2.7 is one of those engines that tends to sludge up when you let it go too long between oil changes, run hot, run low on oil, etc, I really SHOULDN'T be treating it like that!

But anyway, I slapped it back together last nite and put oil in it to see how well it holds. I put a pan under it, and this morning checked it. There's a bit of a drip, but not enough to really worry about. Probably not even a thimble full came out over the course of about 10-11 hours. My roommate's driving it today, because his Tracker's in the shop. He's going to drop off my Trep tonite when he picks his car up. I'm guessing there shouldn't be a problem, with him driving the 15-20 miles to work, and then the 15 or so miles to the repair shop. Although theoretically, I guess the plug could work its way out and drain everything while he's on the interstate, which at this point in the car's life would most likely total it if the engine fries. So there just might be a Charger in my future, after all!

I talked to the mechanic last nite, and he said that they might be able to save the oil pan, depending on how bad it is. I hope so, because otherwise I'd guess I'm looking at several hundred bucks, at least!

Also changed the oil on the truck last night, but that one was uneventful...no damage done there."
3849	August 18, 2005 1:07PM	andre1969	"my uncle's '03 Corolla is somewhere in the 85-90,000 mile range now, and he's still on his original tires!! The most I ever got out of a set of tires was around 47,000 miles, on some cheap General Continentals I put on the Intrepid. The original Goodyear Eagle GA's wore down to racing slicks at around 30,000 miles. The Continentals would've lasted longer, but by 77,000 miles one of them had worn unevenly from when the car had been thrown out of alignment (only affected one front tire but not the other). One tire picked up two nails and had two plugs in it. And still another tire developed a slow leak, where it would gradually deflate to around 20 psi, and then hold. So I really only had one good tire out of the four, and I was getting tired of going to the gas station every few weeks to fill up the tire with the leak.

I put on some Yokohama Avid's at 77,000 miles. Now, at close to 110,000 miles, the tires still look like they have plenty of life left in them. So as long as I don't run over anything sharp or throw the car out of alignment, they might break my record set by those cheap General Continentals!"
3850	August 18, 2005 1:24PM	mark156	"Akangl, couldn't you have purchased two new tires for just at speck more that $50 with your Walmart employee discount? How 'used' are the tires?

The amount of wear that you mentioned on the old tires appears to have been going on for quite sometime. Those tires must have been roaring big time! I'm surprised you could hear the radio.

Be careful, glad things worked our safely for you.

Fellow CCBA, Mark"
3851	August 18, 2005 1:52PM	akangl	"I don't know how much tires would have been at Walmart, I didn't ask. Their cheap tires are really nothing I want to run, even temporarily. The used tires I bought are probably 50% tread, they are Bridgestone Pontenzas, they work fine since in 6 weeks they will get tossed anyway. I'll put Blizzaks on for the winter and buy a brand new set of tires in the spring for Zippy, probably spend $400 or so on tires at that point. So right now she has 2 Bridgestone Pontenzas on the front and 2 Goodyear Eagle RS-A on the back. I only managed to get about 25k out of the Goodyears, very disappointing, then again, they are a high performance tire.

As for noise, the tires made NONE, I had no idication of a problem except for the car pulling to the left and the shaking.

We changed the oil in Zippy just 8k miles ago and had it on a lift, there was NO abnormal wear at all on the tires. Had the tires rotated shortly after that and again, no abnormal wear. So this happened in the last 5k miles.

With the way Zippy is acting now I'm guessing either an alignment or a front end problem or both. We are driving her to Anchorage in a little while, hopefully she behaves. I'm glad I bought the extended warranty!"
3852	August 18, 2005 2:44PM	zodiac2004	"Andre,

I don't think pushing an oil change to 5000 mi would cause any trouble, especially when you racked up the miles on interstate trips.

And an oil pan on an Intrepid should be an easy junkyard part if it needs replacing - no need for new at several hundred bucks."
3853	August 18, 2005 2:56PM	andre1969	"yeah, probably true, but I guess that with the car getting up in miles the way it is, I don't want to make a habit out of these 5,000 mile intervals!

I didn't even think of getting a junkyard oil pan. I never really bothered to look up under there and see how hard it would be to get to. That might be something to look into, though."
3854	August 18, 2005 3:03PM	zodiac2004	"I never really bothered to look up under there and see how hard it would be to get to

That may be the case, but in general any part for a high-volume domestic that doesn't wear out with miles is worth checking in a junkyard. In some cases something that wears out may still be salvageable."
3855	August 18, 2005 3:43PM	jaserb	"Mr J.B. Weld! Then trade the 'Trep in on the Charger, and there 'ya go!

I am, of course, kidding. My younger brother did something like this - I could have killed him. He had stripped out a spark plug hole on his Neon, and rather than take it to a shop for a Helicoil he just used JB weld on the new plug and dumped the car. On a 100k mile Neon that fix will probably outlast a lot of other stuff anyway - clutch, head gasket, timing belt, etc - but I still thought it was a lousy thing to do. Then again I'm the idiot who generally sells a car just when I've gotten everything working just right.

3856	August 18, 2005 3:51PM	gee35coupe	I have a set of Continental Extreme tires on my Civic Si. I hate these tires. What's worse these things aren't acting like high performance tires at all. They have 30k on them and they still look like they can go another 20k. Wear out already.
3857	August 18, 2005 3:52PM	kyfdx	Are those all-seasons or summer tires?
3858	August 18, 2005 3:58PM	gee35coupe	"They are 215/45-17's. I thought ""high performance"" tires wore out quickly. Good question thought. Looks like they are all season though after a quick google. Oh well. I'm too cheap to just dump them though. I'm keeping a real close eye on em. As soon as they hit the wear indicators they are history."
3859	August 18, 2005 4:01PM	andre1969	I think that's the stuff we used on the drain pipe to the kitchen sink when it rotted out last year! Held like a champ...although a new hole has since formed elsewhere!
3860	August 18, 2005 4:04PM	kyfdx	"If they are all-season, they will have the designation ""M+S"", somewhere on the tire...

If you dislike them, dump them.... I once got a set of cheap Dunlops for my Accord, and hated them so much, I pulled them off at 18K miles.. and they still looked new... I was happy as a clam...

Nothing worse than driving on tires you don't like..... If you don't want to spend a ton of money, get some Kumho summer performance tires..

And the 126 sold faster than I had imagined. It actually sold to someone who had interest before I put the ad on craigslist, but I got about 8 replies from craigslist, 4 or 5 of which seemed serious. It's going to a good home, which makes me happy. The guy plans to have every little minor repair done on the car."
3862	August 18, 2005 4:12PM	gee35coupe	But when I do put new tire on, I'm gonna go shocks, alignment, XM radio, tint and everything. Since I can't convince myself I need a new car, I gonna give mine a makeover. It'll be a lot cheaper. And I might as well get the spider condo tuned up too while I'm at it. I drove it the other day. That is one nice car.
3863	August 18, 2005 4:12PM	andre1969	so have you had pretty good luck with Craigslist in general, then? Right now I'm torn between listing my Dart on there, or getting the guy that works on our tractors to come out and get the old gal running. I figure that if I get it running, it'll be an easier/more profitable sell, but I also think that once it's alive again, I'll NEVER want to get rid of it!

It's white, blue clothe interior, 4 door hardtop. When he bought in the early 90's it had 75,000 miles. I'm assuming that it doesn't have more that 85,000 (he never really drove it much because they had two other cars, but not sure).

He said the car would start before the battery went dead. I noticed when I stopped by their house he had it parked way at the end of the driveway in front of the garage. The tires were low and the bushes have grown up close to it.

He told he me he would take $500 for it. Kinda seemed tempting if it doesn't have any major problems just to have fun with for a few months then sell it.

The bench seats are so big that, I guess, it's an eight passenger car ! LOL!

I figure the glass on the car is worth $500!

It's a fun menagerie of neglected late model cars and some older cars sold by private owners that are worthless for trade in. I got double for the 126 selling to a private owner compared to what I could have traded it in for.

The 126 was/is as perfect as one can reasonably expect for a 16 year old car with 182K on it. Everything works, and the paint and interior could be from a car with 30K on it. It needs motor mounts, a gasket near the water pump that is a known issue on this engine, the rear brakes are about gone (I must have hot rodded around more than I thought), the tires are a little old, etc. Nothing serious. The new owner didn't blink an eye at these issues.

That old Impala is well worth it if it is a runner."

And to get back on the CCB topic, I've all but decided against trading up to the TSX... damn long-term fiscal responsibility! Of course it does me no good if I don't have the discipline to hang on to the Accord for a year or two after I get it paid off!

I do believe that was the one year it offered a round speedo instead of a horizontal one. Was there some new high-performance engine available that year that people lust after or something?

I think my favorite Impala would be the '65, followed closely by the '66. '60-62 are cool, too. I used to see a '67 Impala convertible at work occasionally. It was a light/medium non-metallic blue with a blue vinyl interior and white top. I think it had a 307. Can't remember if it was an SS or not. Looked great at a quick glance, but rust was coming out pretty bad around the rear wheel openings. Still, a neat looking car overall."

My twin brother was kinda interested in it but I need to look at it closer to see if everything is there and in decent shape.

The hardtop convertibles are more popular (no B pillar)... this one is not (regular hardtop). My uncle had a '63 two door hardtop Impala (bought new) that he kept for 11 years until someone stole it.

1967 was before headrests and side-lights were mandated. Then in '69, headrests and shoulder belts were mandatory. We had a 1969 Olds Vista Cruiser growing up, Meadow Green with green vinyl and wood paneling.... so lovely!

3877	August 18, 2005 11:54PM	ghulet	'67 was the last year for the 283, '68s had the 307 as the base V8. I dunno why I like the '67s so much; I like the '65s and '68s, too, but not the '66 so much (it's a bit too boxy, which is emphasized by the taillights, IMO. Really, I'd take just about any '60s Chevy, especially Impalas and Caprices, and I really like four-door hardtops. I remember one aunt had a '67 Caprice four-door (gold with black vinyl top and cloth interior) and a friend of another aunt had a '67 Impala two-door hardtop (white with blue or black interior); maybe I just like them based on childhood memories?
3878	August 19, 2005 12:22AM	andre1969	"guess it was a 283 then. I DO remember that it was a V-8, but not a 327, so I guess that just leaves the 283. We had a '68 Impala 4-door hardtop when I was a little kid. First car I can remember. It was kind of a teal greenish blue, and I think it had a black vinyl top. I'm pretty sure it had a 327. My grandparents had bought it new, but in 1972 they were in the market for a new car. My Mom had a '66 Catalina convertible, and didn't like the idea of driving around in a convertible with a baby. Plus, I heard my Dad drove the car a lot and really ragged it out! :mad: So Grandmom and Granddad swapped my Mom the '68 for the convertible, and used it as a trade-in on a '72 Impala 4-door hardtop.

The neighbors behind my grandparents, back in the 90's, had a '65 Impala 4-door sedan. I forget the engine...it was a smallblock, probably just a 283. Nice, light silvery-green color. Neighbor hit a deer with it, and really messed it up. I always thought that was ironic...hitting a deer with an Impala! It sat along their driveway, actually partly on our property, for what seemed like a few years, and then finally they got rid of it.

I always thought the 4-door hardtop in general was a pretty body style. Sometimes I wish I'd held onto my '69 Bonneville, which was a 4-door hardtop."

(They attempted to verify the urban legend about the guy who strapped a military rocket to his car and turned it and himself into a smoldering heap that was found sometime later. Their conclusion was that it didn't happen.)

I think I'm out of the market for the time being, too. Had been thinking about a replacement for the Focus, but with gas running $2.60 per gallon, it makes sense to keep it because of the versatility and good gas mileage. It has almost 30K on it, and other than oil changes and tire rotations, not one thing has gone wrong with it.

Nippononly, it was not the poor Sentra's fault. I totaled the first one because I had no idea how to drive in the winter - touched the breaks on a highway curve going about 45-50 and came around after a spin out and hitting the guardrail at least twice. No humans or other cars were harmed in producing that episode :P

At that time, a 6 y.o. Sentra or comparable cheap (under $3k) car was all I could comfortably afford. Though a similar vintage Corolla/Chevy Nova may have been a better choice and lasted longer.

I got run off the road and hit a traffic light pole sideways on March 23, 1992, a day that will always stick in my head (good thing the pole didn't stick in my head, or anywhere else, for that matter! :surprise: ) Well, the very next day I was driving to the campus, most likely in my Granddad's '85 Silverado, and lo and behold, there's this beauty of a black 1968 Dart hardtop parked along the road, with a for sale sign in the window! I went and looked closer, and saw it was a V-8, had a sunroof (not stock, obviously) and a killer sound system.

Unfortunately, it was also raining that day, and, well, let's just say that black primer paint looks awfully nice and shiny when it's wet, but not nearly so nice when it's dry! And when I talked to the owner, he told me it had 253,000 miles on it. That almost scared me away right there, but he did say the engine had been rebuilt at 242K, and the tranny/rear were replaced around the same time.

I thought it was destiny, that the very next day, after I totaled Dart #1, that I saw this one for sale. Ended up taking posession on April 3, the day after my birthday."
3901	August 23, 2005 5:21PM	ghulet	"....the worst car accident I've EVER been in was a minor fender-bender involving my '77 Caprice and a then brand-new Supra. It used to be that on Sheridan Road in Chicago, north of Hollywood til you got to Devon, traffic at rush hours would change to a three lane one way, one lane the other way pattern. Despite the fact that I was almost to Devon, I was totally unaware that the lane next to me (that, in normal traffic and on a normal road, would have been going south), was also going north; so I put on my turn signal to turn left into the gas station that was on the corner at the time, started my turn when a new Supra smacks into my LR door. The thing was jammed shut, or so I thought, for about a year til one of my friends opened it from the inside, not knowing it was jammed. Kinda funny. Strange thing was, the guy in the Supra had been driving like a complete [non-permissible content removed] right before, and I said to my passengers, 'that guy's gonna get in an accident', or something to that effect. Little did I know.

All this talk of pickup trucks is interesting. I'd like to have one sometimes, but owning one means you have LOTS of people wanting to borrow it every weekend (ask my uncle how many times I used his F150 to move or haul my crap to school between 1987 and about 1994). His was reasonable, had a big six and an OD transmission (still sucked up gas, fortunately it had two tanks), I think it had a tilt wheel, air and a cassette, that was about it. I don't understand the notion of a 'luxury' pickup or anything even resembling one; I'd rather have one I don't mind getting dirty (in and out) and that doesn't cost $40k.

Only reason for thinking diesel was we could save around $1500 in fuel costs on the trip and overall(diesel would get better mileage than the Titan pulling the TT). Well, that and it would be handy for helping with the firewood deliveries. :P"
3911	August 24, 2005 12:22PM	andre1969	I think that's just the name that Chevy called their 283 V-8, and nothing special in and of itself. By 1967 I believe it came in 195 hp (2-bbl) or 220 hp (4-bbl) versions. Not a powerhouse, but probably a nice cruising car, and probably wouldn't be too evil on the fuel bill.
3912	August 24, 2005 12:30PM	andre1969	"$13K sounds pretty tempting for a new truck. I spec'd out an '05 GMC Sierra on Edmund's, regular cab, 8' bed, automatic, 4.8 V-8, CD player, sliding rear window with tinted glass, locking differential, and handling/trailering package, and it only came out to $16,500. I don't think Edmund's was using the employee pricing though, but instead doing TMV minus $3,000 cash back.

Still, pretty tempting. I have a feeling though, that it's going to be hard to find the truck I really want. I'd probably have to special order an '06. Seems like regular cab/8-foot bed models are in the minority these days, and finding a basic work truck with vinyl seats and no carpeting, but with a CD player and sliding window, and the locking rear end and trailering package is probably a long shot.

Once the mechanic gets back to me with the Silverado's diagnosis though, if it's bad enough I might start looking. Plus, there are a few other problems with the F-150 I'd mentioned earlier. First, it's in Michigan. Second, it hasn't been driven in about a year! :surprise:"

Just a great sounding 350 V8, 3 speed automatic transmission and a black vinyl bench seat with 2 lap belts.

Of course, before he had it restored, he turned down an $8500 offer for it, which I know is stupid money. Now, with a fresh paint job, chrome and rubber gaskets, along with the bedliner, I wonder what kind of offers he'll get.

I doubt that he'll ever sell it .. we figured out that he's had this truck half his life -- he bought the truck new in 1970 and my dad turned 70 himself on 8/12.

He's getting a new dashboard pad put in - the old one is cracked - and needs to get a couple of the wheels repainted - they're white with the dog-dish hubcaps - but other than that, it looks and runs like a brand new truck. In fact, I was just in CA for his birthday and all he has to do is flick the key and the engine starts. No cranking whatsoever. Amazing.

Of course, when he passes, I don't think I could bring it to Colorado ... I don't think I could ever tune the carbs to run at the high altitude we live in. Perhaps it will go to my son."
3918	August 24, 2005 10:39PM	andre1969	"I'd almost be tempted by something like that!

That's also a reason I'm a bit reluctant to buy a new truck. I know that the first little scratch it gets on it, I'm going to carry on about it. My Granddad was actually the same way about the Silverado, when it was newer. I remember one time he backed into something and messed up the tailgate. He sent it to the body shop to get it fixed. I don't think he EVER in his life sent something to the body shop! But with this truck he did.

I gotta stop this, because it sounds like I'm starting to make a case for sinking a bunch of money into this truck to keep it running. Heck, it's been in the family for 20 years now...what's another 20? And it has become a part of the family. It's been around since I was 15, and not even old enough to drive. The yard would almost look empty without it. But, with time, the grass where it spilled its fuel will turn green again, and I'll move on to brighter pastures. Nothing lasts forever!"

Funny thing about that Chevy, is that it looks like it has the same camper shell that Granddad had the Silverado back when it was newer. Looks like the GMC has the same shell. I always liked that quad headlight front end on the GMCs, too!

Guess if I bought the Chevy, I could give the hubcaps to Lemko!

As for the F-100, I never really understood that designation. I always thought a half-ton truck was about as weak as they got. So this thing would have an even lower capacity than an F-150?!

Dodge ain't bad, either. I liked the earlier years of that style...it looked really modern for 1972. But fast forward to 1992, and it looked downright archaic!"
3923	August 25, 2005 1:14AM	woodyww	"That's true. Heck, even being able to hose out a rubber interior could have it's advantages. I think ""stripped"" had a different meaning 15 or 20 years ago however--back then it was pretty drastic. When your daily driver, & only vehicle, doesn't even have tinted glass, or a radio, it can get grim.

I owned an '86 toyota p/u that I bought used in the late '80's & had for 3 or 4 years. It had NOTHING for options except A/C. Rubber interior, flimsy, not fun. I drove it into Boston 4-5 times a week for work. But I didn't worry about parking it on the street, & when it got mildly rear-ended once, I didn't care. When the doors got bashed in, because the metal was so tinny, & flimsy, I pulled out the dents with a toilet plunger. (Thankfully, Toyota trucks have improved immensely since then). Oh, & I spent about $80 in maintenance in 3 years, for 2 oil changes, & a new horn.

Years later, when I had the ""bread"", I bought a 2 1/2 y.o. Range Rover. Beautiful vehicle. Women loved it, I loved it, one of the most impressive vehicles I've ever owned. Even tho it was under warranty, I spent about $1500 for repairs & service in the year that I owned it, then sold it 6 mo. before the warranty ran out, because a LR w/o warranty is a truly bad idea, IMO. All in all, I had to eat about $10K (maint. & depreciation) to own the thing for a year. (Of course, you can BUY a quite decent used car or truck for $10K).

If I were to buy a new-ish truck now, I'd go for a late model 4/Runner or Taco, if I could afford the gas, & even the base models now are fairly well equipped. On my 100 car ""fantasy list"" tho, is a '53 Ford p/u.....

It got horrible mileage, broke a lot (who knew so much could go so wrong on such a basic vehicle?) and I was happy to trade it for the Accord we still have (this was eight years ago.) Even though I traded it at a loss (the first and only time I've ever done that) the fuel savings alone made up the difference in monthly payments, and this was back when gas was really, really cheap!"
3926	August 25, 2005 4:52AM	ghulet	"....bring back memories (some good, some not so good). I think in the same year (had to be '75 or '76), my parents and maternal grandpa both bought early '70s Chevy pickups. Grandpas was a '71 'Longhorn' (long bed), C20 with a 350BB (four-barrel, IIRC; my uncle referred to it as a 'big block', which I think is technically incorrect) and an automatic, power steering and brakes and a factory AM radio, not much else (factory A/C being rather rare on trucks back then), and a cool color combo, copper outside, white vinyl inside. That thing was terribly reliable, if not pretty at the time, and I was later to find out once I started driving (1985) a BLAST to drive because that thing could haul [non-permissible content removed]. TONS of torque. I was really kinda sad when gramps got rid of it (around 1988, I believe), it had WELL over 200k, I think ran OK but was literally rusting away. Wish I had that truck now. My parents, unfortunately, had a '72 C10 with a six-cylinder and three on the tree, the same AM radio, power nothing, red with black interior. I don't know if they thought they would save gas or something by not getting a V8, maybe they did, but mostly because the damn thing NEVER ran right, it was just plagued with choke/carb problems, IIRC. My parents never had the best luck with cars til the '80s, they were constantly chosing orphans or just cars with the wrong stuff (like that truck); let's see, we had a Datsun 510 (OK, not a bad car, I guess), a Fiat Brava, a Pontiac Sunbird. Everyone on the block is driving Malibus and we just had wierdo cars.

Oh my, I'm off topic, aren't I? Been getting the itch to buy a car (another beater), keep seeing decent (sounding) ones on craigslist; I've seen a bunch of Saturns (not my first choice, but super cheap, frugal with our $3 gas and, alas, never rusty), saw a nice looking first-gen Acura Legend sedan for like $600 (not a gas saver, though), always some ten to fifteen year-old domestic stuff in there (Corsicas, Centuries, Cavaliers, Tauruses and the like). Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that old GM V6s run forever, but more often than not need the fuel injectors replaced, which sounds like they cost more than the cars do at this point?

Andre, not that you asked me, but I don't know (given all the other vehicles you own), that I could justify buying a brand-new truck to haul junk to the dump or the occasional refridgerator, even if it's only like $15k. Think how many times in five years you could rent a truck for that much! Of course, if you get 20+ years out of it like your family has with the Silverado, I guess it's not so bad (especially since you could probably get a few bucks out of it still)."
3927	August 25, 2005 1:10PM	mark156	"Ghulet, since you don't have a car and thinking of getting a beater, it made me think of my friend in Washington DC. In the last 15 years, he has lived in big cities like Philadelphia, Washington DC and nearby suburbs.

Recently, he had a Geo Metro and when we moved to Washington, he just didn't use it. It stayed parked on the street at his apartment. The battery kept going dead and he got tired of messing with it so he sold it.

The only time he needs a car is when he goes to the suburbs to the mall/Sam's club/Costco, etc. There is a company that rents cars to the folks who live in the city. These cars are parked strategically around town. You only pay by the hour and that includes gas and insurance. There is a gas card in the glove box so that when you are finished with the car, you are required to fill it up for the next hourly renter. The schedule works very tight so when you request the rental, you have to tell them how many hours you are going to use the car and you will need to have it back for the next renter.

I had never heard of this type of renting and is very interesting as my friend only needs a car, maybe, once or twice a month for a few hours each time.

Now that's a way to feed our ""CCBA"" urges.... just rent occasionally by the hour!

Mark"
3928	August 25, 2005 2:32PM	nippononly	"they have some pretty cool cars sometimes too. City Car here in SF has VW New Beetles.

Those places are fairly pricey. Four hours of one of those rentals is the same price as a daily rental from Budget or Enterprise.

They make good sense for folks that just need it for an hour to run errands like grocery shopping though. MUCH cheaper than buying a car for someone in the city who can use public transport most of the time, and would have no place to park a car anyway. And probably owns a scooter. :-P

Latest cars to catch my eye at the local dealer: a BEAUTIFUL white '95 SC400 with 100K on it for around $10 grand, and an '01 turbo Beetle with half those miles and a 5-speed for around the same price.

I know the SC will be all slop, not an ounce of sport in that chassis, but I LOVE the looks. As for the Beetle, it had the bigger alloys and looked really nice (silver). Those were sportier, although I know they still have significant body roll in cornering.

Thought I might go drive them both. Either one would probably be costly to keep for long."

3932	August 25, 2005 3:18PM	jlawrence01	For the record, I am renting a car (compact) from Hertz most weekends in Chicagoland for $10-15 per day depending on what coupons and stuff I can find. Enterprise is renting for $9.99/day, 3 day minimum and 100 miles per day in teh Chicagoland area.
3933	August 25, 2005 4:23PM	ghulet	....the hourly rental thing sounds nice in concept, but I have access to a vehicle most of the time; it's just those times I feel like just hopping in the car and going *somewhere* (impulsively), or I want to go visit my mom or to the burbs that I'd like a car. In either case, the hourly rental thing wouldn't work. If I had to take public trans or a cab to go pick the car up (the closest hourly is at a Jewel food store a couple miles from my house), I'd just.....take public trans or a cab and be done with it. I think those hourlys work for people who are a little more 'hard core' urban than I am, or who literally don't know anyone with a car they can beg, borrow or steal for a few hours. Now, that $10 Enterprise thing sounds excellent, and for $30-40 for an entire weekend, I'd be about flush with what I usually spend on cabs!

If we did, I might do it just to quell the CCB urge once in a while, like someone above said.

Thanks for the heads-ups on those two cars I am going to take a look at. You would need a manual shift in the SC300, otherwise it would be pretty slow by today's standards - just a little faster than a 4-cyl Camry. They were very porky for a small car by the standards then. But since that car is so UNsporty, and the manual is so hard to find, I would prefer the bigger engine.

As for the NB, I would not even consider buying if all the recalls have not been done. I have always liked the looks of that car, I remember when it was brand new I went and drove an NA model. It was very slow, or I might have done something back then. At the price of the turbo, I would have bought something from Honda/Acura. But the looks have grown on me over the years, and the price on the used one seems decent."
3936	August 25, 2005 6:10PM	woodyww	"In 1979 I actually bought a '79 full size Chevy P/U with the infamous Olds Diesel engine. You know, the lemon engine that they ""converted"" from a 350 gas engine, & later there were consumer lawsuits. Anyway, being unusually young & foolish at the time, I paid way over list for the thing, because of the energy crisis, yada yada. The engine blew up a month later when I was 1000 miles away on a business trip, & it took 3 weeks to get it fixed. I kept it for 4 years, because I was stuck in these payments that you couldn't pay off early (w/o paying the whole 4 years of interest)......When I finally traded it in, & was amazed that a dealer would even take it, I literally prayed driving to the dealer that the engine wouldn't blow up again as the warranty had run out.

Oh yeah, this one of my stripper trucks, a ""Custom Deluxe"". I never did figure out what was ""Deluxe"" about it.....it had an ugly plaid vinyl seat, & a steering wheel, & am radio. I guess that was ""Deluxe"" to Chevy....."
3937	August 25, 2005 7:45PM	jlawrence01	"Nippon,

First, Hertz is really pushing into the ""neighborhood"" locations. They are trying to buy market from the Enterprise crowd.

Second, Southwest Airlines has a coupn that gives you $5/day off a weekend rental + 5% off the rate.

Third, since I am renting form a non-airport location, I do not pay all the airport taxes that I would pay in Daleyville. Instead of paying taxes and fees of 24%, I am paying 6%.

Finally, I have an old beater that is pretty reliable. I would rather rent a car for $21 out the door to drive 750 miles this weekend (one that will get me 32-35 mpg) than to use mine and get 28 mpg. I figure that if I only use my car going back and forth to work 11 miles one way, I will soon become the longest CCBA member that is still in recovery (g).

3942	August 26, 2005 12:22PM	andre1969	"you make an excellent point about spending (or not spending) $15K or so for a new truck that I don't use that often. And that's something I've been thinking about alot, although I do try to suppress it when I get in the mood for a new truck! :P

I wonder if part of it might be genetic with me? My uncle has always had a truck, from around 1988 or so until now. Sometimes he'd have a car and a truck, but he always had a truck. Grandmom and Granddad always had both a car and a truck, too. She'd drive the car, and he'd drive the truck. And even back in prehistoric times, Grandmom's parents always had a car and a truck! In fact, in the Depression, when things were tight, they lost their farm in the country, and lost their car, but they held onto their truck! They had to though, because her father was a mason/carpenter, and built houses, so a truck was essential to him.

As for how much I've actually used my Silverado? Well, at the beginning of October, it'll be 3 years that I've had it. It's gone about 6,000 miles in that time. Lots of trips to the dump, Home Depot, Lowes, etc. And I used it when I moved from the condo to the house. But for something like that, which costs $400 to insure, and that I've put minimal money into, it kinda makes sense. But it wouldn't make financial sense to buy a new one. It would be nice from a convenience standpoint, since the truck would always be there, instead of having to run out and rent one. And it would suffice as a spare car (but do I need any more of those? :blush: )

And in all fairness, on those times that I do need a truck, I can always borrow my uncle's. He has the short bed and a camper shell on it, which limits its usefulness in some ways, but it can still do most of what I'd need it to. He'd probably get mad though, if he saw me chaining logs to it and dragging them out of the woods! He might also take offense if I used it to push my Dart around in the yard..."
3943	August 26, 2005 12:25PM	andre1969	does that Sebring have the 4-cyl or the 2.7? Also, I know you said you've tended to dump the Mopars from your fleet around the 70-80K mile mark, but have you ever had a problem with any of them sludging?

3947	August 26, 2005 1:59PM	anonymousposts	they have a First Drive of the Civic ready. They just can't release it until the embargo ends. The seats look comfortable. Build quality looks good. I'm sure the manual tranny will be top notch as most Hondas are. Power should be adequate and the safety features seem to be there. The Si coupe would be a great replacement for our 03 Si and it's going to be a tough call between buying my car at the end of the lease or returning it for a new Civic EX sedan w/ NAV. Then again, the new Accords will be coming out when my lease is over..... Either way I think we should buy the Si coupe.

Its really amazing what insurance companies will total a car over, I've been through the junkyard where my brother works many many times, a lot of the vehicles in there are EASY and CHEAP fixes. Sometimes an owner sells a car to the yard because the tranny is acting weird or the clutch is out. Usually the yard hardly pays a thing for those vehicles. Its sad really.

I'm thinking: A. with an SUV I can keep the miles off the Titan (can use the SUV as a grocery hauler, family hauler, and my bad roads car), B. The Titan can sit all winter and most of the summer except for pulling the TT, and C. the SUV will be cheap (less than $1500 including repairs) and only require liability insurance. Oh and D. Why didn't I snap up that 98 Jeep GC before my brother got it, lol, well, not really since its a V-8.

The money crunch is over since firewood season has hit (very early and unexpected this year) and I have almost enough in savings now to buy the SUV, soon I will have enough.

All the vehicles we have now will stay. The Dodge at least will be paid off in the spring, maybe Zippy too. We are going to hang onto to the Titan until the lease is up and then decide if we want to keep it or not. If its under the mileage we will probably turn it in and walk away, if its over we will probably buy it.

If the deal on the Exploder doesn't roll through he's going to keep looking, I told him $1k is my cap and no more than $500 in needed repairs to make it driveable. He says no problem.

Hmmmm, this could be a new spin on my CCB habit. Might even be able to make a little scratch doing it. Could buy that Explorer, fix it, drive it all winter, then turn it for an easy $3k (double my money). I really do have a sick addiction to junkyards, I find the coolest stuff in there."

He bought it in 1968, it was basic transportation, 4 door, slant 6, AM radio, automatic, beige. You couldn't kill that car! It ran and ran and ran and ran. As it got older, it leaked oil like the Exxon Valdez. Before we would leave for school, Dad would put two quarts of oil in it and it ran like a top. The speedometer broke at 93,000 miles so I think it must have had very close to 200,000 miles at the time he got rid of it in Feb. of 1979.

When the time came to get rid of it, Dad took it to the junk yard, probably got $75 for it. Not long after, he saw it driving down the street as someone else's daily commuter.

So now that firewood season has started and the money crunch is over, think about next year and start saving a little bit each week NOW so next year we won't see you writing about storing the children! :P

We'll check it out on the computer when I go home this weekend. I suspect it's the glow plugs or harness, which are cheap parts... He seems to be okay with selling it once we get the light to go out.

I have a theory that once a car has to be towed, for reasons of mechanical failure or accident, it's cursed, and needs to be put out of its misery (or, in the case of selling it, into someone else's misery).

He's had a Civic and two CRX's before, so the new model should be an easy sell, except I know he will hate the electronic instruments.

I can only find the information about VSA being standard on press releases on the European model.

It looks like American Honda is riding on their ""we're committed to safety"" high horse, while not offering life-saving technology that they offer on the exact same Civics in Europe."
3971	September 1, 2005 3:43AM	anonymousposts	sold in Europe are different. They actually get a torsion beam suspension in Europe. Besides, Honda probably won't offer VSA in the Civic until all Accords have it, probably beginning with the 2008 redesign. Honda does deserve credit for making ABS and the side curtains standard even on lowly DX models.

Ouch!

I'm going to drive less aggressively with this tank and see if maybe I can get a little bit better mileage.

EDIT: my daughter filled up the L300 on Sunday - last night she noticed that she's only gone 104 miles on this tank but the gas gauge is reading 1/4 full.

Andre, you sure that modern cars can't have their tanks siphoned? I looked at the spot where she parks ... no obvious leaks on the ground."
3974	September 2, 2005 2:28PM	andre1969	"I'm starting to second-guess myself there. I was under the impression that there was a screen in place in the fuel filler neck that kept you from being able to stick a hose down in there. But then I've heard people today talking about siphoning fuel, and buying locking gas caps and such.

All I know is that I was unable to get a siphoning tube down in my '85 Silverado a few months ago. And this one had a pretty narrow tube. The truck had sprung a leak, and I tried to siphon the gas out so it wouldn't leak all over the yard. I ended up putting something under it to catch it.

Maybe you can still do it, but just need a narrower tube? You could actually stick a garden hose down in my Dart, DeSoto, or Catalina to siphon it out"
3975	September 2, 2005 2:30PM	michaellno	You hit the nail on the head ... methinks that this weekend the L300 will be getting a locking gas cap. The daughter parks in the HS parking lot as well as the lot for her job (Safeway grocery store). Plenty of opportunities for folks to steal gas from others.
3976	September 2, 2005 3:16PM	mark156	"My good friend who lives in Chicago told me a story about his sister last week. She had parked in the Jewel grocery store parking lot as she was going to do her weekly shopping.

This girl is expecting a baby in about 4 months. When she returned to her new 2005 Mercury Mountaineer, she saw a Hyundai Sonata parked really close to her. Since she parked way out so that no one would bump her new vehicle, she was thinking that this guy must have hit her new SUV and was waiting for her to return. Well, as she walked up, he had a hose in her tank connected to his Hyundai.

She said ""what the %$% are you doing?""..... he got flustered and said, ""is this your vehicle"".... she said ""yes"". He quickly pulled the hose out of her tank and jumped in his car and drove off. Her cell phone was in the SUV so she quickly called 911 and reported the guy. She was able to read his license number.

He was a 52 year old fella with two small children in the back seat... most likely grand children.

The police filled out a report and ran his tag. They asked her if she would want to press charges and she said ""of course"". The last I heard is that the police were on their way get the guy.

Also, she said that she didn't think the guy got much gas if any because her gas gauge hadn't changed much.

PS. Now that I think about it, I don't think my 2002 ML500 has a locking gas door like my E430 has. :mad:"
3977	September 2, 2005 3:20PM	andre1969	I guess there goes my theory about not being able to siphon fuel anymore!

I'll give updates as soon as I hear them.

Andre.... Even though the man tried to shighon the fuel, it appears that he didn't get much or any fuel from what the girls gas gauge was reporting. I guess if he got a gallon, the fuel gauge wouldn't change much. And who knows if she actually remembers where the gauge was. Anyway, the guy sure is guilty of trying!

I got the word on Wednesday that I will be tranferring back to my former location. The distance is the same while the traffic will be worse. About 10-30 minutes more depending on what time I go in. So I probably will be using a bit more gas. Fortunately, I got a raise to go back there so I should still end up in the black."

3982	September 2, 2005 8:49PM	andre1969	"does anybody use those anymore? For some reason, I'm thinking that my '88 LeBaron had a remote release for the fuel filler, but I think a lot of makers phased that out. FWIW though, if someone wants your fuel bad enough, those remote fuel fillers and locking gas caps aren't going to keep people out. My '89 Gran Fury had a locking gas cap. One night at the gas station, it malfunctioned, and wouldn't unlock. So I broke it with a screwdriver I happened to have in the car (I think I used it to shove down the carb to keep it open when it got cranky and wouldn't start)

But, I guess all these deterrents like remote filler doors and locking gas caps have to do is make it a little harder to get into your car, so the thief moves on to an easier target. So they probably still serve their purpose."

Of course, we're talking a matter of degrees, here. As for gas siphoning, guess it's time to go pick up a locking gascap for the pickup. Our MPV has a remote fuel door release, as have the last 3 foreign cars I've owned.

The MMC for the TSX also looks nice, plus they added an integrated jack for an ipod, aoong with more goodies.

As much as the MPG of the Civic looks good (especially at today's gas prices), and the MSRP appeals to my frugal nature (OK, I'm cheap), I think I might miss having all the goodies that my aging body needs to pamper it.

I don't think I could justify the 33K+ for a decently equipped 325i, but an Accord or TSX for mid-20's ish might be doable.

4009	September 7, 2005 8:39PM	andre1969	like it would be overkill. Usually it's smaller, overmatched engines that tend to benefit from additional gears. I guess you could argue the 12-13 speed trannies that big trucks use, but when you consider the weight they have to move, they're probably still overmatched! For instance, I had two dump truck loads of gravel delivered last week for a garage/driveway I'm building. Each load was 14 cubic yards, and they told me a cubic yard is about 3,000 lb. So that's 42,000 lb just for the load, and then I'd guess the truck itself must weigh around 7 or 8 tons...

Automatic 21/30
Six-speed 20/30

4019	September 8, 2005 1:57PM	zodiac2004	"IMHO the only reason to have 6-speed over 5-speed is to have a wider spread of gear ratios - lower first gear and a taller top gear. So you get better acceleration and better fuel economy.

Doesn't the Corvette do it your way with an ultra low 6th? Maybe a Viper, too? Do any normal cars have a super-overdrive? (sorry I reused the complicated technical term ""super-overdrive"")"
4022	September 8, 2005 2:18PM	andre1969	"that Honda uses in the Accord has two overdrive gears. 3rd gear is your 1.00:1 ratio (or ""Direct Drive"" as they used to call it in the old days). I think 4th gear is somewhere around 0.75:1 and 5th gear is around 0.52:1.

It has a fairly short axle though, of 4.44:1, so in 5th gear your OTGR (Overall Top Gear Ratio) is around 2.30:1. Fairly tall and loafy, but not ""super tall"". For instance, back in the late 70's and early 80's, bigger GM cars with 3-speed automatics often had 2.41:1 and even 2.14:1 axles. My '79 NYer has a 2.45:1 rear, and in '81 Chrysler switched all of their V-8 RWD non-police cars to tall 2.26:1 axles.

In the 80's, when 4-speed overdrive trannies started to become popular, family-type cars with the Chevy 305 usually had a 2.56:1 rear, while cars with the Olds 307 usually had a 2.73:1. Overdrive gear on that tranny though is 0.667:1, giving you an OTGR of 1.71:1 on the Chevy and 1.82:1 on the Olds engine. I'd imagine that would be considered pretty tall."

As it is, though, that 6th gear is necessary for decent mileage when cruising at 45 mph and over. I have gotten an average of 25 mpg since owning it, which I think is pretty good for the performance you get.

And as far as shifting too much ... only if the engine is too whimpy for a 6-speed. A car like the Z has plenty of torque that I am able to keep it in 3rd gear through most traffic jams (as long as i don't have to come to a complete stop)."

But, as automatic trannies get more speeds/more R&D, and better TCM tuning, you'll find that, not only do they perform better than a stick (no missed shifts/shifting too early or late), their mileage is also getting better, to the point, in some cases, where they are in the same neighborhood as the manuals... there is still the weight penalty of an auto, but no clutch to replace.

Wonder if we'll see autostick or tapshift replace the manual alltogether? Wouldn't surprise me. But that would probably be available only on the top-end models (i.e. like Pontiac did with the last GTP), rather than the base/low-end models...

I found myself at least one gear higher than I would expect to be most of the time, and shifting at 4K rather than 3K just because the engine revved up so quickly. I believe the top gear RPMs were about the same as my 5 speed maxima was, about 2600-2700 @60. Much shorter than really needed for comfortable cruising.

IMO, the TSX gearing could be dropped at least 10% and it would still be quick and fun, but more relaxed and economical too.

I agree that 6th should be a cruiser gear. If I need to accelerate quick or hit a big hill, I can drop down to 5th. I buy a stick, so I must not mind shifting, plus the way it is now you whift all the time around town anyway!

As nice as the TSX was, if I decided to get something like that, I would probably save the 5K+ and get an Accord EXL 4 cyl 5 speed. Pretty much the same powerband up to 5K (which I rarely exceed anyway), but taller gearing and better mileage, and darn near all the same goodies.

That is, if the new CIvic doesn't push all my buttons for 18K, but there would still be those features missing (XM built in, power seat, etc.)."
4032	September 8, 2005 6:37PM	zodiac2004	"Don't you get the feeling the manufacturers don't really want to improve fuel mileage. C'mon, 2700 rpm @ 60 mph in a 6-speed is a little too much.

Maybe they are trying to promote their hybrids by lowering the mileage of the gas only cars."
4033	September 8, 2005 6:41PM	michaellno	"Well, the way I see it, Acura is the ""luxury/sport"" division, while Honda is the ""everyday"" division, so it doesn't surprise me to find out the TSX is geared a bit shorter than the Accord ... same engine, but tuned differently (200HP for the TSX vs. 166 (!) for the Accord).

When I had my Accord ('93 DX with a 5-speed, 125HP), I never felt it didn't have enough get up and go, even here in Colorado.

My Focus cruises at 70-75MPH at about 3100 RPM's on the tach; the wife's VUE, OTOH (V6 with a 5-speed auto) does the same speed at about 2200 RPM's."
4034	September 8, 2005 7:06PM	andre1969	"does sound a bit excessive, for top gear! FWIW that's about what my NYer would pull if I forced it to stay in second gear at 60 mph! Of course, that's a totally different breed of car from something sporty like a TSX, but still, I'd think that 6th gear would be an economy gear anyway. Might as well use those extra gears to get a good blend of power AND economy.

My Intrepid hits 2700 rpm in top gear round 81 mph (at least, doing the math...I know it hits 2000@60, 2500@75, and 3000@90)"
4035	September 8, 2005 7:53PM	paulhuang	"I currently own a 98 Maxima GXE 5-speed and feel that 5th gear could/should be taller. There is no reason why my car should get worse highway fuel economy than the automatic :mad:

The electronic governor kicks in at 112 MPH on my car (came with S-rated tires) and that is about 5500 RPM in 4th gear, 1K short of redline. I can have all the fun I want in gears 1-4 and have a tall 5th gear for fuel economy. Even a SE with a governor of 130 MPH still doesn&#146;t need 5th gear to be so short. Too bad Nissan didn't feel that way."
4036	September 8, 2005 8:26PM	qbrozen	"but both of you guys are comparing vehicles with bigger engines to those with smaller ones. Due to the forces keeping a car from maintaining its speed, a certain amount of torque and horsepower are necessary to keep a car moving. A 4-cyl, low-power engine just can't keep a car cruising at high speed at low rpms.

Can some of these cars keep their speed at a lower rpm? Sure. Could a 100 hp 4-cyl keep its cruising speed at the same rpms as a 400 hp 8-cyl? Not likely."
4037	September 8, 2005 8:43PM	andre1969	"on your cruising speed and how much weight you have to move. For instance, if you had a 3000 lb car that you wanted to move along at 60 mph, then I'm sure a 100 hp 4-cyl would be able to do the same amount of revs as the V-8. It doesn't take much horsepower to do that. For instance, my Intrepid's 2.7 is only pulling 2000 rpm@60, and this is an engine that barely has any hp at the lower rpms. Now it would need to downshift if I needed to accelerate fast, or if a steep enough hill came up, but crusing along at a steady speed is no big deal.

And a TSX with the 2.4 has just as much hp as my '00 Intrepid, although it has about 24 less ft-lb of torque (166 versus 190). So it has 87% of the torque. And 93% of the weight (3230 lb versus 3471, according to Edmund's). So I would think that a TSX would be able to get by with a taller top gear, to give you better fuel economy in certain situations. You could always downshift if you needed the power."
4038	September 8, 2005 8:44PM	andre1969	"the Accord with a 4-cyl and 5-speed automatic will loaf along at around 2200-2300rpm@75 mph. So will an Altima with the 4-cyl/4-speed automatic. So I think that's an indication there that you really don't need a lot of power to hit your ""typical"" cruising speed."
4039	September 8, 2005 9:07PM	stickguy	"also isn't ""low powered"". The brochure has an output graph, and it is putting out about 90% of peak torque from around 2K, so it really could have a taller 6th gear.

I experiment by seeing how it pulls from lower revs (say 1800K in top gear, which may be around 40 mph). If it pulls strong, it doesn't need to be running like a sewing machine at 60 mph.

My tC is a worse offender. The 2.4l Camry motor is basically a torque lump, but they have it geared like a Miata. No way i heck it needs to be turning 3K at 66 MPH. You could drop the revs at 75 by 1,000, and it would still never need to be downshifted to pull hills or pass."
4040	September 8, 2005 10:01PM	corvette	"So will an Altima with the 4-cyl/4-speed automatic.

It's been a while, but I could have sworn it was higher than 22-2300 rpm at 75. 2700 maybe? Anyway, for whatever reason, Nissans and Mazdas as a whole get worse fuel mileage than Hondas and Toyotas. The highway rating on the 4cyl/4-speed automatic Altima is 29, compared to the Accord and Camry's 34 (the Camry/Accord have an extra gear in the automatic). The Mazda6's mileage is nothing to write home about, either. You can make the same comparison with similar results among the Civic, Corolla, Sentra, and Mazda3.

When I had a (gasoline) Volkswagen, people always asked if I got good mileage. From what I can gather looking at the fueleconomy.gov site, the only thing that VW has produced in the past two decades that got ""good"" mileage compared to its competitors are their diesels.

I have only driven an automatic TSX, which felt slow, although it probably wasn't objectively slow. The interior was kind of chintzy."
4041	September 8, 2005 10:12PM	andre1969	"I'm pretty sure it was below 2500. Reason this sticks in my mind is because I remember test-driving an '02 Altima, and thinking how eerily quiet it was at higher speeds. I remember looking down and noticing that it was revving lower than my Intrepid at 75, so that would put it below 2500 rpm.

Too bad Nissan didn't give the 4-cyl a 5-speed automatic. The 3.5 V-6 has a 5-speed auto, and it gets 30 on the EPA's highway cycle! 1mpg BETTER than the 4-cyl! That ain't right! :mad:

You want to hear a REALLY bad case of over-revving, though? My buddy's '98 Tracker, with a 1.6 4-cyl and 3-speed automatic, pulls something like 3500 rpm at 55 mph! No wonder that thing always sounds like it's going fast, even when it isn't! 55 mph sure SEEMS a lot faster in that thing than it does in my battlecruisers! :surprise:

It gets horrible highway mileage, too. I doubt if he could break 25 mpg."
4042	September 8, 2005 10:31PM	bumpy	"is about what my Accent does. It likes hanging those rpm's, being a 1.5L SOHC 4-banger. My '92 SE-R pulls around 3000 rpm at 60 mph, but the SR20 is basically loafing along then. :shades:

On the other hand, my GMC with a 4.10 rear end also pulls around 2700 rpm at 60 mph. :sick: Unlike the Hyundai, the 351 V6 doesn't like that high revving at all, and exacts its revenge at the gas station.

FWD transmissions force designers to make some choices: optimize the gearing for fuel economy or performance. There's not enough room in the transaxle case for really tall overdrives or really short 1st or 2nd gears, so they have to make the choice in the final gear and give up one or the other."
4043	September 9, 2005 12:06AM	andre1969	"my '57 DeSoto should be doing around 2400 rpm@60 and around 3000 rpm@75. It has 8.55x14 bias ply tires that have a diameter of 28.1 inches. The standard rear in the Firedome was a 3.31:1, although I'm sure there were optional ratios.

I always thought that was fairly short for a rear end in a car like this, but I've heard that the Hemi is an engine that does like to rev. Plus, they weren't all that concerned about fuel economy back then"
4044	September 9, 2005 12:08AM	ghulet	"...........Due to the forces keeping a car from maintaining its speed, a certain amount of torque and horsepower are necessary to keep a car moving. A 4-cyl, low-power engine just can't keep a car cruising at high speed at low rpms.

I dunno, qbrozen. While I had a '90 Mazda Protege LX (125hp DOHC, 5-speed manual), turned like 3200rpm at 70mph, quite annoying, my ex had an '84 Accord (~100hp, 5-speed manual) that absolutely loafed, something like 2000rpm at 70mph. Clearly, the Pro had a lot more power on tap all over the rev range, and you had to downshift the Accord if you wanted to pass rapidly, but I'd rather have that with at least the option of quiet and decent mileage. The Pro drove me nuts on the highway. Long and short of it, hardly any power is needed to keep a car cruising at higher speeds once it gets there.


."
4045	September 9, 2005 12:23AM	nippononly	"funny example of shifting perspectives: first time I ever drove the TSX I thought ""adequate power down low, zings once you get the revs up"". But the last time I drove one, I had just stepped out of a test drive of the A3 - 40 more lb-ft available from 1500 rpm on - and the TSX felt like it had the torque of a wet spaghetti noodle (which is to say, not much!).

I think that car needs to stay revving to maintain that ""power at the drop of the hammer"" feeling, although perhaps the gears are too closely spaced.

Now consider this: the '06 Accord V-6 MT. SAME price, 20% MORE power, 25% MORE torque, SAME FUEL ECONOMY RATING, slightly bigger and less sporty, but with most of the doodads the TSX has (as long as you can learn to ""settle"" for the Honda badge!). The Accord V-6 is sporty enough that if it were me I would leave behind the somewhat low-torque TSX, and for the same money pick up the Accord."
4046	September 9, 2005 12:59AM	ghulet	
4047	September 9, 2005 2:50AM	corvette	I may be thinking of the approximate RPM at 91 MPH, which was the maximum speed you can set on the cruise control... (Which was actually 87-88 after correcting for speedometer error.)
4048	September 9, 2005 4:08AM	anonymousposts	"can pull 80 @ 3000 RPM. At that speed you can easily pass slower traffic without downshifting. If someone is in front of you trying to block traffic you can throw it in 3rd and it will give you a good amount of oomph for passing in a hurry. In normal driving it's really not necessary to take it above 3000 RPM when driving and/or shifting. Keeping it below 3000RPM also make it a gas-miser. Add to that the comfort of the heated and power driver's seat, XM radio, sunroof, dual-zone climate and you have one awesome car for $22,000.

With that said though I still like that new Civic."
4049	September 9, 2005 1:51PM	stickguy	"pricing is now out. Looks like about 18.8k for an EX 5 speed stick. I think that at MSRP that is about 4K below an Accord EX cloth.

Now just need some supply so I can combine a decent discout with the (supposed) high resale of a tC and I might have to pull the trigger.

Then I can drive my wife nuts complaining that I should have gotten the Accord since it is biger, etc....

One thing I ain't getting is a Camry. I have a loaner today (brand new LE 4 cyl AT). Real quiet and smooth/isolated, but it almost puts me to sleep with the isolated driving experience and numb steering. Frankly, not much different than the '05 Impala I drove last week, but the seats were a little better."
4050	September 9, 2005 3:18PM	qbrozen	"Are you sure about that 2k rpms at 70?? I've NEVER had any car do that. I have 2 5-speed automatics in the driveway now (one V8 and one v6) and both of those cruise at higher rpms. My Z in 6th at 70 even cruised higher (around 2700, i believe).

Of course, in addition to power being a factor, also gearing, aerodynamics, and tire size can affect how easily a vehicle can maintain its speed.

Was the accord able to maintain its speed uphill? For instance, in my old '87 4runner 5-speed, I couldn't get up the Verazzano bridge without downshifting, or else I would steadily loose speed even with the pedal pinned to the floor. the 116 hp 4-cyl, 30 inch tires, and horrible aerodynamics all played a part in that vehicle not being able to maintain speed in high gear."
4051	September 9, 2005 3:23PM	jcat707	The V6 Explorer goes 2K at 70. Or at least the 03 that I have driven and ridden in countless times does.
4052	September 9, 2005 3:26PM	andre1969	"that my old man's '03 Regal would do around 2000 rpm@70. At least, it's only doing around 1600 or so @60. Of course, it's also got a relatively large engine. And I'm sure my old LeSabre and Monte would be pulling around 2000 rpm@70, if that, although they wouldn't be able to hold overdrive on a long hill. If you got a good running start and to up to 85+ before you hit the upgrade (the speedos pegged at 85) you might be able to make it up a long grade with enough momentum so that the tranny wouldn't have to downshift, and only losing a little speed.

My '79 NYer would only be doing around 2100 rpm@70. That's also a bit of a sweet spot for it, since it hits peak torque around 2400 rpm, so it has no trouble taking the long grades without having to downshift. It only has a 3-speed though, no overdrive. In fact, I don't think it would downshift at that speed, no matter how hard you stomped it. Although downshifting it to second at 70 mph would still ony put it to around 3,000 rpm."
4053	September 9, 2005 4:31PM	ghulet	.......but I know that Accord always felt docile and quiet, even at relatively high speeds. But since it was low on power, I'm sure you had to downshift to get it to make any 'real' power, including going up hills, etc. I'm sure the low gearing was one of the main factors in its stellar gas mileage, though. Lemme do some research and get back to you on the RPMS/MPH thing. It also helps that those second-gen Accord sedans (his was a base '84, IIRC) only weigh 2337 lbs (compared to a modern Accord DX at 3058). Oh, and it had 86hp.
4054	September 9, 2005 4:46PM	michaellno	I owned an '85 Accord LX hatchback when I got out of college. I used that 86HP to get me from California to Michigan and back on vacation once. I don't remember what kind of RPM's it had when cruising, but I do remember that the best mileage we got was just over 43MPG, heading west on I-40 in NM. I know it was downhill; I wonder if it was downwind as well?
4055	September 9, 2005 6:20PM	andre1969	"my college buddy's '80 Accord hatchback, which I think had a 1.6 with like 72 hp, and a 3-speed automatic, was actually pretty quiet at highway speeds. That thing died way back in 1989, so my memory's a bit fuzzy on it and I don't remember what kind of revs it pulled. However, we went to Busch Gardens in it once, and I drove it. Got up to 80 mph on some interstate stretches, and while it took awhile to get there, it didn't seem all that loud. And it wouldn't keep up on a long hill, unless you got enough of a running start.

I have a feeling that it was revving pretty high, but because it was a fairly smooth, sophisticated engine for the time, it didn't draw too much attention to itself. Didn't really squeak or rattle, either. My '80 Malibu would've had less engine noise at 80 mph, and been much more responsive, but let's not talk about the squeaks and rattles! :blush:"
4056	September 10, 2005 1:25AM	bobst	We got our 2005 EX Accord 5-sp stick with cloth interior for $20700 OTD in March. That included the Virginia 3.1% sales tax and a couple options (2 extra keys, mud flaps, pin stripe).
4057	September 10, 2005 1:32AM	bobst	"We have a 2003 Acura RSX with a manual 5-sp. The higher prices S version has a 6-sp.

I looked at the gear ratios in the sales brochure. The 5-sp and 6-sp have the same gear ration in first gear. The ratio of my 5th gear is the same as the ratio of the 6th gear in the 6-sp.

Therefore, gears 2,3, and 4 in my tranny are replaced by gears 2,3,4, and 5 in the 6-sp tranny. Sounds kind of silly to me.

I can see the point of a 6th gear with a tall ratio for a car that goes over 120 mph. That doea not include me and my precious little RSX. What a neat car!!!"
4058	September 10, 2005 1:38AM	gouldn	"TSX v Accord
Exactly the same choice I went through ... although I was concerned with Automatics (due to SF bay area traffic). Drove a TSX ... nice handler, but was underpowered in my opinion. Drove a 05 Accord EX-V6 coupe ... tons of power ... same mileage ... and doesn't call for premium fuel. I've driven it about 9K now, and am getting 30MPG in a trafficy commute, about 34 on long trips. Plus I got the coupe for $24.8K. Love it so far ... and I may even keep this one for three years!"
4059	September 10, 2005 9:41AM	jjtj	My Silverado 2500 turns about 2K @ 70mph.. 6.0 V8 with a 4-spd automatic & 3.73 gears.. still only gets 15 MPG on the highway though!
4060	September 11, 2005 1:27AM	boomchek	I got my 78 Chevy back on the road today after fixing those tie rod ends . And I don't know what it turns at 70 mph cause it doesn't have a tach, or even a coolant temp gauge.
4061	September 11, 2005 1:34AM	ghulet	....I had a '77 Caprice when I was in high school and college, it had a speedometer, odometer (no trip) and a gas gauge, that was about it; there was a gauge package optional on those cars, but you don't see it too often (not that you even see the cars too often, at this point). Still, that was one of the best cars I ever owned.
4062	September 11, 2005 1:37AM	boomchek	"Oh you can enjoy and relive all those memories my friend once you get into this Chevy. It's a 78 Impala which is the same thing as the Caprice and the gauges are exactly as you describe them. I have 99572kms on it and since it's a 5 digit odometer it will turn over to 0 very soon. :shades:

The car floats like a boat, handles like a bus, and guzzles gas like there's no tommorow. I'm thinking of selling it but I like it too much."
4063	September 11, 2005 2:15AM	andre1969	"that Impala has a 2.56:1 rear end. If you go to www.tirerack.com, and look up some tires that are the same size that are on your car, in the specs they list how many revolutions per mile the tires will turn. For instance, a 205/75/R-15 tire, which was most likely standard on that car (or they might've cheaped out and put 195/75/R-15s, like Chrysler did on the '79-81 R-bodies) turns 769 rpm. Multiply that by 2.56, and that'll give you the revolutions per mile, which would also happen to be the revolutions per minute at 60 mph. In this case 1969 rpm. To get the rpm@70 mph, just take the 1969 and multiply by 7/6ths, which gives you 2297.

Now I'm sure this isn't an exact calculation, but should give you a pretty close estimate. I'd imagine that the actual rpms of the engine would be a bit higher, due to slippage in the transmission and such, even though these cars probably had a lockup torque convertor by that time.

Oh, and here's a little nostalgia trip for you guys... http://www.tocmp.com/brochures/Chev/1979/index.html"
4064	September 12, 2005 12:56AM	ghulet	"...what engine does your Chevy have (BTW, is it a Caprice or Impala)? Mine had the 305 two-barrel V8, which produced a not-so-robust 145hp, IIRC (less than many four-cylinders do now). It never felt all that underpowered, though, and gas mileage seemed OK at the time (probably about 20mpg on the highway, I imagine about 15 in the city). I suppose this car seemed frugal to me at the time mostly because the car I had before was a '71 Buick Electra, which probably used twice as much fuel.

Andre, that brochure reminds me again that almost everything was optional. Didn't matter if you were buying an Impala or Caprice, pretty much the only differences were in trim. If you wanted things we take for granted now on cars (A/C, remote mirrors, rear defrost) on up to more luxurious items (power windows/locks/seat, tilt wheels), you were going to pay for them. Can't remember ever having seen a big Chevy with a power sunroof back then, didn't even know that was optional; of course, you didn't even see those much even on Cadillacs and Lincolns, sunroofs were quite exotic at the time, IIRC."
4065	September 12, 2005 2:31AM	boomchek	"I think it has a 305 V8. I personally don't know what the difference is between the Impala and the Caprice as they both looked identical (maybe it was a trim level?).

Mine is pretty basic as it has no power windows, no power locks, no tilt, no cruise. It has an AM Radio with ""tone"" control with a centrally mounted dash speaker (for that surround sound impression :P ).

It has no tach, no coolant temp guage, no trip odometer, no factory windshield washer (it does have an aftermarket one ), no right headlight and grille at the moment. It does however have the rear window defroster, four ashtrays, a cigarette lighter, and a big ol' bench seat in the front.

On another note I think I'm (gulp) grown up!!!! :surprise:

I had my new Civic for a month now and even though I have an aftermarket exhaust and a nice sound system ready for it (from my previous Civic) I am in no hurry to install it. For some reason I want to leave it stock, enjoy the neweness of the car, and have a nice quiet ride. I guess I don't feel the need to impress anyone with a big coffee can exhaust and pounding bass.

Maybe next year I'll rebecome immature :blush:"
4066	September 12, 2005 1:44PM	andre1969	"if it's an Impala or a Caprice is whether or not there's carpeting on the lower door panels. You could get cloth or vinyl in both the Impala and Caprice, but the Impala, at least the '77-85, never had carpeting on the lower door panels. As for the grille, they were very close in '78, but the Caprice had kind of an eggcrate grille, with the horizontal bars being about as thick as the vertical bars, while the Impala's grille had three prominent horizontal bars, and with much more horizontal grille openings.

Impala and Caprice taillights were usually different, too. The Impala usually had the backup light in between the two outer lights. The Caprice usually had three red taillights on either side, with backup lights inboard, framing the license plate.

As for whether it's a 305 or a 350, chances are it's a 305. That's how most of them were equipped. One way to tell though, would be to take the top off the air cleaner and see whether it's a 2-bbl or a 4-bbl. I think there was a 4-bbl option for the 305, but the vast majority of them were 2-bbls. The 350 was only offered as a 4-bbl by that time.

The 350 is also a pretty gutsy engine, even the emasculated ones from around that time. While it only had 170 hp, I think it had around 280-290 ft-lb of torque. So if you had one, I don't think you'd be complaining about it feeling weak or anything! Well, unless you're used to driving Mustang 5.0's or something! :shades:"
4067	September 12, 2005 4:58PM	ghulet	...the Mustang 5.0s of the time only had about 150hp, IIRC, so the 350 would only compare unfavorably to a newer version. Actually, I got the Caprice rather than the orange '79 Mercury Capri 5.0 someone was selling right around the corner from my HS. I really liked that car, but it was more money than mom wanted to spend (actually, my uncle talked her out of it, I think he was jealous), so I got the Caprice instead, which was probably a good thing in the end (I got in enough trouble as a teenager with a car, absent parents and a fairly serious substance abuse problem as it was, don't think an orange V8 pony car would have helped any!).

Comments?"
4069	September 12, 2005 7:28PM	stickguy	"probably about right for a dealer service. And while it probably includes some items that aren't required in the manual, I would do all of them except maybe the PS service, just as preventive maintenance. Assuming of course you plan to keep the car for a while.

You could save some money by having it done by a local mechanic if you have one, but probably not that much, since there is a fair amount of labor involved. Or, do some of the easy stuff yourself and save some $$ (stuff like the air filter). You can also save by having the rotation and various inspections done at a reputable tire/brake shop.

pretty much it becomes a function of how comfortable you are with non-dealer service centers, and how much time/energy you want to invest in the process.

But, a Focus isn't exactly a Maybach, so you should be able to get this basic service done just about anywhere. The only piece that I worry about is the tranny service, since you want to make sure they use the correct fluid. That one I always like a dealer to do, but that's just me.

Hey, you asked for my opinion!"
4070	September 12, 2005 7:29PM	andre1969	"the power steering service is most likely Bull. FWIW, I've NEVER had a power steering service done on my '00 Intrepid, and it's got 110,000 miles on it now. Although now that I said that, watch it fail on me! I've never had a fuel filter replaced, either. Usually they're in the tank nowadays, and they're supposed to be good for the life of the car...which means that when they DO fail, you're talking some big bucks!

I also doubt there's anything in the steering and suspension that can be lubed anymore...isn't most of that stuff usually sealed away these days? I thought grease fittings were a thing of the past? You might want to get the tranny service done, depending on how you drive. I've had my Intrepid's tranny done every 30,000 miles, just to be safe. The last time I had it done was at a local tranny shop, and they charged around $78.

$388 sounds like an awful lot to me for just poking around a car, rotating the tires, changing a few filters, and flushing the power steering and tranny. But, the times they are a'changin'!"
4071	September 12, 2005 7:30PM	stickguy	isn't this FOcus a stick? If so, discount the price of the tranny service, since that assumes it is an AT. At most, they would drain/refill the transaxle fluid, which probably isn't needed at this point anyway, but a local guy could easily do it.
4072	September 12, 2005 7:39PM	andre1969	"the Dodge dealer tried to get me to come in for a 30,000 mile service on my Intrepid. They wanted to hit me up with a bunch of stuff like belts (60K interval, according to the owner's manual) and hoses (5yr/100K), coolant flush 5yr/100k), a tuneup (50k severe service/100K ""regular"" service), and other assorted bull, for around $300. The main thing I was concerned about was the transmission, which this service didn't even cover! I think they wanted to hit me with another $150 or so for that!"
4073	September 12, 2005 7:43PM	rowlandj	"Find out what the warranty requires and find a local shop to do whatever the owners manual suggests for each service interval.

All that 'inspect this and that' is pretty much nonsense at the mileage you have. I am sure that the actual MANUFACTURER recommended items have much longer intervals and I think the dealers load up their services way over what is needed.

Finally, I think you will find that there would be a recommendation in the owners manual against any kind of oil or fuel additives so that last line makes me call the entire thing into question even if the rest were valid items.

JR"
4074	September 12, 2005 8:03PM	bobst	"The moral of the story: Find a service provider you can trust.

From my unfortunate experience with a Ford, I think yours at 30K miles is about on its last legs. If you find someone you trust to service the car, it may last for a few more days."
4075	September 12, 2005 8:08PM	andre1969	sounds like a Ford-hater! :shades: FWIW, there's a kid here at work with a 2000 Focus, and he doesn't take very good care of it. It's a 5-speed, and he's got around 83,000 miles on it. Now I doubt that he'll make it to 100K miles, but when it blows I think it'll be more his fault than the car's!
4076	September 12, 2005 8:15PM	michaellno	"I called the dealer where I purchased the Focus, and they quoted me $425 for the 30K service!

I asked about the transmission, since it is a stick, and they told me they drop the pan, check the gaskets and filters, and replace the fluid.

Next step will be to check the owners manual to see what the manufacturer says ought to be done.

bobst: ouch! I'm kinda hoping that it'll last longer than the 31K I currently have on it .. though I know you have an affinity for Honda products, I'm reasonably confident that the stuff made in the US (well, Mexico in the case of the Focus) is pretty well screwed together.

Other than the normal lube, oil and filter, plus some tire rotations, the Focus hasn't needed to see the inside of the shop in the 22 months we've owned it."
4077	September 12, 2005 8:22PM	qbrozen	"I would get under the car and make sure that tranny even has a pan. I can't remember a manual tranny I've owned that had one.

2nd, as far as all those ""inspect this and that"" garbage, why not do it yourself? Take a look at the brakes. Pads and rotors still good? Done.
Check the belts. not frayed? tension good? Done.
Etc.

I don't believe in paying a dealer to check anything. I check it and I'll tell them when its time to replace or fix."
4078	September 12, 2005 10:44PM	gee35coupe	Lose that service guy quick.
4079	September 13, 2005 1:58AM	akangl	Had Zippy's 30k service done and she's now at 47k with no issues. I use Amsoil 0W-30, change the oil filter at 12,500 miles and change the oil and filter at 25k. Been doing this since she had 10k miles on her with no issues. Last oil analysis showed the oil was ready to be changed at 25k (had already changed it), but no issues with the engine.
4080	September 13, 2005 2:04AM	ghulet	I doubt, in this day and age, a 'relatively' simple car like a Focus should need a $400 service at 30k. It's always good to have the basics checked out, but often you can have half that stuff done free or at nominal cost with an oil change. As far as brakes, they normally go at about 40k, right? So just pay attention to the squeaking, same as always; fluids can be checked in a few minutes, then topped off; and with a manual transmission, I can't see the need for any 'transmission service'.
4081	September 13, 2005 4:31AM	nippononly	"Manual transmissions have a case, not a pan, and have no filters to check. Lose that service department in a DOUBLE quick hurry. They are either completely incompetent or more likely trying to rip you off by charging you for a ""standard service"" consisting mostly of items your car doesn't need!

It doesn't even need fresh transmission oil at that age, really."
4082	September 13, 2005 12:48PM	anonymousposts	How's the LS working out? Do you regret trading the 350 yet?
4083	September 13, 2005 1:16PM	michaellno	"Thanks for the feedback ... the only issues that the car is having at the moment is some squeaking brakes (been that way since I bought the car), but now I'm getting a bit of ""shudder"" through the steering wheel, which may mean that I need to have them looked at a bit closer, plus the power steering ""groans"" when making a left turn.

I've never been much of a shade tree mechanic - I once drained the crankcase of my folks '73 Corona and put 5 quarts of oil in the transmission, then attempted to drive 35 miles to a basketball game when I was in high school - so I've never had a problem taking my cars into the dealer for service.

But, as many of you rightfully point out, $400 for what amounts to a glorified LOF with a bunch of inspections seems a bit steep.

I'm curious as to what the local ""drive thru"" oil change place would charge .. perhaps a phone call to them might be in order.

BTW, this would be the last visit to the dealer while the car is still under the 3/36 warranty, so there might be an advantage to having them give the car a once over and get any warranty items taken care of."
4084	September 13, 2005 1:28PM	stickguy	good point. If the PS is groaning, have them look at that at least.
4085	September 13, 2005 1:48PM	andre1969	"the shudder occur? If it does it while you're braking, then your rotors could be warped. Otherwise, you might just need your tires balanced. Often when your tires go out of balance, there's a certain speed that the car will shudder. For instance, my '89 Gran Fury used to be fine up to around 60 mph, but would then shudder, until you got it up over 70 or so.

One other possibility is a bent rim, which might also make the steering shudder at certain speeds.

Also, you might want to watch some of those quickie lube places...they're often more gouge-happy than the dealer! I guess I'm also a bit leery, because I've had bad experiences with some of them. Years ago, my uncle took our '85 Silverado to a quickie place to have the oil changed. This was back in the early 90's, when it hardly got driven. I was still in college, and maybe once or twice a week I'd drive it to school just so it wouldn't sit. Well, one morning, a few days after the oil had been changed, I hopped in the truck and turned the key. Oil light came on like it normally does...but never went off! I shut it off immediately, popped the hood, and checked the dipstick. Dry. Looked underneath to find a loose drainplug, and a nice slick on the grass where the truck was parked.

Oh, and a few years ago, I had a bit of a run-in with Firestone. The exact quote I got from the managerette on duty was ""LOOK, we don't have time to look up the oil requirements of every single car out there. 10W-30 works fine with most of them!"" Ummm, seems to me that if you're a professional, then knowing, or looking up if you DON'T know, the oil requirements of a customer's car just goes with the territory!

Oh yeah, the only times I've had power steering groan was when it was running low on fluid. It was saying ""FEED ME""!"
4086	September 13, 2005 2:42PM	asafonov	I would stay away from massively franchised LOF shops (everybody knows their names) that advertise 12.99 or 15.99 oil changes. Use word of mouth, or Cartalk's Mechani-X files search to locate a reputable mechanic in your area. I'd rather pay extra 5 or 10 dollars for an oil change for the knowledge that it is performed by somebody I know, with more than a few days experience on the job.
4087	September 13, 2005 4:22PM	qbrozen	"its fine, thanks for asking. Not as comfy as my volvo and certainly not as sporty as the Z, but it does ok. makes for a decent highway cruiser.

Heck, I regretted trading the Z before I even did it, but sometimes you gotta do things you don't want to do.

Saw that new Z commercial on TV last night. That was painful."
4088	September 13, 2005 5:42PM	stickguy	"went for a test drive today (2006 Civic). DIdn't do any business, bucause while I liked the car, I wasn't swpet off my feet on the first date. I plan to go look and drive another one tomorrow to see how things go. But for now, I'm probably maintaining status quo, but I am definitely officially in the market.

The 2006 Accord was a nice piece, but they are up to $24,700 MSRP for an EX-L 4 cyl 5 speed stick. Lotta coin for the configuration.

I'm real interested in seeing the Fusion when it comes out to compare it to the Honda's. Doesn't hurt that my neighbor is the GSM at a Ford dealer either."
4089	September 13, 2005 5:43PM	stickguy	but the last couple of trips down that road haven't been as fulfilling as I hoped. I just need to figure out what I really want, and buy it and hold onto it for a long time. And since my eldest just started high school, forever may be a long, long time (tuition issues and all that).
4090	September 13, 2005 10:46PM	corvette	"The exception I have seen is that Big O Tires tends to have good, honest service (and, they're cheap, at least for the things I used them for). The ones I've been to don't do transmission fluid or coolant, but they can handle the LOF stuff, tires, brakes, shocks, and alignment, which is nearly all you need.

Most of us will never own a car long enough to reap the benefit of maintaining it according to a dealer's excessive schedule. Even if we did, it might not pay off. I see way too many people ignore or creatively interpret service requirements on Camries, 626's and the like, and these people still have reliable cars. I think a lot of it is just dumb luck."
4091	September 14, 2005 1:48AM	anonymousposts	"What did you not like about the Civic? Hopefully Gee and I can get out soon to take a look at them. We plan to tomorrow when we go on our quarterly toy shopping trip for little Gee.

The new Accord may MSRP for $24,700 but I have a feeling you could probably get one for around $22,000. A leftover 05 would be even less. You'd be missing out on the refresh and heated mirrors but otherwise it has all of the safety equipment you need (good selling point to Mrs. Stickguy), good performance, and great gas mileage consider the size of the car.

The Fusion is interesting. However, I'm not to fond of the interior. Overall, it's OK but that steering wheel is not to my liking. It also looks a bit dated to me, at least in the photos I've seen recently. Additionally, it uses the same 2.3L as the Mazda6 if I am not mistaken but is bigger and heavier. That doesn't sound good for performance. The 6 is a bit of a dog at low RPM as it is. And they muted the sound of the engine. One thing I enjoyed about the 6 with the 5-speed and the 2.3 was the sound and feel of the car at high RPM."
4092	September 14, 2005 1:53AM	anonymousposts	I hated to trade my 03 EX-L Accord Coupe 5-speed manual for the automatic sedan. Hated it even more when I had the baby and realized that I wanted my stick back. Hated it even more than that when the CCB in me took over and I traded the automatic Accord for a 5-speed Accord. I should've listened to Gee when he questioned my desire for the automatic.......
4093	September 14, 2005 2:29AM	stickguy	"The only thing that didn't seem quite right on the CIvic was the comfort level of the front seats. But, I didn't spend much time fiddling, and the plastic was still on, so I plan to give it another chance tomorrow. DId seem to drive nice.

Odd as it may seem, I try to avoid test drivng a car before any prep (with plastic everywhere, filthy, etc.). Plus, you never no if everything is in order. I really am concerned with the seats, since they are tres important to me (I just like good seats, and have some back issues). The Accord does feel good though.

The supply of '05s (especially sticks, limited to start with) is starting to dry up. My dealer had a ton of '06s already hidden in back. And maybe it is shallow, but I do like the new butt better! Although for a killer deal, I can live with the old one. I even really like it in your color (Redrock).

However, not likely that they are dropping 2.5K off MSRP on an '06 anytime soon. Maybe a clearance deal on an '05 for close to 20?

I really do want to like the CIvic more, since it is over 4K cheaper MSRP (18.8 vs. 23K, comparing EX to EX)"
4094	September 14, 2005 2:36AM	anonymousposts	"in our Accord is one of the reasons I love it. Even when I was 9 months pregnant I was comfortable. No back or butt pain on long trips either. Before I make a final judgement I will have to see and drive the Civic in person. I'm also guessing that you might have liked the EX more because it has an armrest and the roof. It's usually not a good idea to test drive a car that's not identical to the one you want.

After seeing the 06 Accord in person I think I like my 04 better. IMHO, the 04 Accord looks like it was designed with the whole car in mind. With the 06 I got the impression they just fixed what people said was wrong with it. I like the new rear by itself but think the 03-05 rear suits the rest of the car better. I know I am in the minority though.

Doesn't seem like you drive much so why not go all out and lease yourself a 06 6-speed sedan? You'd give up a couple of MPG but gain a whole lot in the way of power and driving fun. Take the money from your tC and let it draw interest."
4095	September 14, 2005 3:18AM	stickguy	"you are a good enabler, aren't you? If my wife thought like you, we would be in BK most likely.

I am actually trying to avoid buying something too pricey, or too powerful, but I can certainly be convinced to waive that last part. If I drove a 6+6, I might drop off the wagon.

With a Civic, my car (paid off) plus a few grand loose change and I still have new wheels and no payment. If the new car comes with payments, I will get the evil eye from Mrs. stick, but I can live with that.

Also, the Civic LX has a fantastic armrest, seems quite similar to the Accord I also sat in. I require a roof, but the EX civic was otherwise pretty identical to the LX. I did test fit, and had plenty of headroom (moe than I got now!).

I plan to go shopping early tomorrow. Will ahve to get the salesguy to find the CIvic and 5 and 6 speed Accords if he can."
4096	September 14, 2005 3:21AM	stickguy	OT (assuming we have one here) but something this dealer group now has that facilitates impulse shopping is cool. Instead of waiting while the sales dude writes down stock numbers and wanders away to look for keys, they have boxes on each car (similar to the electronic key boxes realtors now use). He puts in the code, and gets the keys to any car. Pretty handy since most of th stock is now kept in a somewhat remote cnetral lot (it's a mutli store dealer row operation).
4097	September 14, 2005 3:49PM	stickguy	"drove both back to back this morning. Civic was impressive, and surprisingly close in roominess, at least up front, although I fit fine in the back too. Mostly just a little narrower

Drove an Accord EX 5 speed. Nice driving car, slightly quieter/less sporty/more relaxed than the CIvic. It did have great seats though. The Civics felt a bit better than the ones in the car I drove last night (but I really do neet to try a car without plastic wrap on the seat), but not quite Accord level. I actually think I would be happy with either one, even though they do have soemwhat different personalities.

To me, the Accord doesn't really offer enough extra value to justify the difference in price (18.8k for the Civic, 23K for the Accord), with is just over 4 grand. Of course, real world pricing may be closer, but I do think the Accord is a little overpriced, or maybe I'm just out of touch."
4098	September 14, 2005 6:02PM	gee35coupe	"You have no idea how true that is. When you have a wife who works for a car dealership, that knows how to calculate a lease, and can memorize MSRP, TMV and real world pricing on any car that you ever had an inkling of owning.

Not to mention this same wife tells you that "" you've been a good boy so you can go out and buy whatever you want"". That's why we've had 30 cars in 10 years."

And, either I'm not as good as you, or she doesn't care! Although she will no longer get involved when I am looking for myself (I drive her crazy with it), so I pretty much have carte blanche to get whatever I want. She knows I'm too cheap to buy anything real expensive!"

Is it time for me to turn in my CCBA membership card??

BTW, Zippy has just shy of 48k miles on her........I still love my little car!! :blush:"
4101	September 14, 2005 7:53PM	michaellno	"Before I met my wife, I think she owned 3 cars in 15 years:

VW Beetle
Datsun 210
Ford Tempo

In the 9 years we've been together, she's had the following as her daily drivers for a length of time:

Ford Escort LX
VW New Beetle
Ford Explorer
Saturn L300
Saturn VUE

Plus, we've bought or leased the following that she hasn't driven regularly:

Ford Expedition
Chevrolet Tracker
Ford Focus
Saturn L200

Strangely, like Jolie, I'm debating with myself whether to get another car or not. The L300 has, I think, 43K and is the daughters car. The Focus has 31K on it and gets a steady 30-32MPG on my commute to and from work. The VUE has 12K on it (in 10 months!) and is the wife's daily driver - well, when its her turn to drive with her co-worker.

My office will be moving at the end of next week and I'd really like to start driving the L300 again, but I like the fuel usage of the Focus. That, and has been previously mentioned and debated, the daughter hasn't learned to drive a stick.

As much as I'd like to trade the Focus in for something else for the daughter to drive, I kinda like the idea of her in a larger car, just in case. Plus, it keeps the mileage down - I'm figuring that when the loan is paid off in a couple of years, the L300 will have maybe 70K on it - lots of life left with no car payments.

There really isn't anything wrong with the Focus that makes me want to trade it in - it gets good mileage, has been trouble free, has all the amenities one could want (power windows, locks, cruise, tilt, keyless remote, AC, CD player). About the only thing I could see replacing it with is a Pontiac Vibe, which is very similar in many respects but gets a little bit better mileage (36 hwy vs. 32 for the Focus, according to the EPA).

OTOH, all three of us really like the Saturn Sky, so when it is released early next year, I could see all logic going out the window.

BTW, does anyone know what the MPG figures are for the Solstice? I figure that the Sky will be the same, as they share the same powertrain."
4102	September 15, 2005 2:41PM	anonymousposts	"However, Gee is a good husband and a great Daddy so he deserves a reward. Plus he has put up with me for 10 years ... that's gotta be worth something.

I haven't seen the 06 Civic in person yet. However, if you consider that you will probably be able to get $1000 off of the Civic that puts it at $17,800. The Accord EX 5-speed invoices at $20,000. You should be able to get the Accord for invoice .. maybe even less. So the difference is $2200. The Accord is in it's 3rd/4th year so most of the kinks have been worked out vs. the Civic being a first year model. The Accord also has a front/rear double wishbone suspension.

On the other side, the Civic gets better gas mileage, is smaller so it should be sportier and easier to manevuer, and it's cheaper. It has the same safety equipment as the Accord and pretty much the same luxury options as well.

Guess you have a tough decision to make. FWIW, I love my Accord. No problems in 24,000 miles. Drives great and gives me 31 MPG in mixed driving.

Have you looked at the Mazda3/Mazda6 yet?"
4103	September 15, 2005 2:43PM	anonymousposts	The Solstice is rated at 20/28.
4104	September 15, 2005 2:52PM	corvette	Ouch. Short gearing, I suppose.
4105	September 15, 2005 3:09PM	stickguy	is actually geared fairly tall in top gear, especially compared to the Miata. There were comparos in most of the magazines last month, and the SOlstice came across as the tourer of th ebunch (although it has negligible cargo room). The Miata may not be a great highway cruiser, but at least it has an actual trunk!
4106	September 15, 2005 3:17PM	stickguy	"Accord vs. Civic will be a tough choice in many cases. Are you sure that invoice is 20K? Maybe that was for the '05. MSRP of an '06 cloth EX is $23,00 even. I did like the Civic, but didn't fall in love, and the Accord does have nice seats.

I did look at Mazdas yesterday. I just don't find the seats in the 6 comfy, but do really like the 3. That car just feels right to me when I sit in it, and the leather seats are nice. I plan to go drive a 3 at lunch today just for the heck of it.

The Civic is rated a little higher mpg (not too much if you get the 3i model), and might be a little more refied, but I think the 3 might be more comfortable. I should have taken one out yesterday when I stopped to test sit (and get my blockbuster certificate singed).

I may decide to hold out for something more luxurious, but that is more $$, so the tC may be around for a while. That is unless the Mazda dealer has something I like, and is willing to make me an offer I can't refuse.

I might swing by the Volvo dealer too, just for the heck of it, in case they have a program car for cheap.

At least the '06 3s are out, so there is a supply to look at."
4107	September 15, 2005 3:53PM	andre1969	is the new Civic really that much bigger than the old one? I never could get comfortable in the previous Civic, but the current Accord fits me just fine.
4108	September 15, 2005 4:09PM	stickguy	I never really spent any time in the last gen Civic, but this one seems to have plenty of room. Up front, it's a little narrower, but other than that, seems comparable to the Accord.
4109	September 15, 2005 8:33PM	corvette	"...geared fairly tall in top gear...

Second stab in the dark: I suppose it's just the performance tuning on the Ecotec--kind of like the Cobalt SS engine."
4110	September 15, 2005 9:05PM	stickguy	"spent some time at the mazda dealer today. Turns out I like the 3 even more than I remembered. It fits me real well. I drove a Grand touring model (new this year, basically the old SP23 with every goodie on it). FOund the seats to be very comfortable, really no issues or need to rationalize (except it wouldn't mind if they tilted up slightly in the front, but I could probably fix that).

Drives like a little hot rod, handles nice, pulls strong. Probably a little noiser than the Civic, but it's a ""good"" noise. Definitely the performance car in the class.

SHifts nice too, but a much different layout of the shifter (you reach dwon for the stubby lever, as opposed to to reaching up in the Honda).

The Honda gets better mileage, the Mazda has more torque, and still gets relatively good mileage. A 3i is almost as good as the Civic, but doesn't come with leather.

The 3 can be a bit pricing. The GT was $21,060, but that includes heated leather, auto climate control, Xenons, and some other stuff the Civic doesn't have. A cloth touring without the fancy stuff like HIDs and ACC is about $19,050, so comparable to a Civic EX.

Unfortunately, the 3 has no rebates or fire sale prices, but I guess you get what you pay for.

I may go back tomorrow and talk some numbers on a touring w/leather (saving $1,400 worth of HIDs and auto CC that I don't really care about)."

That'll give me time to evaluate the new IS, SI, and GTI. I figure I should be ready to go about next Christmas.

Stickguy...I'd go for the 3. I love the 4 door but I don't fit in it. I also don't like Sirius radio and Ford/Mazda is Sirius only. I'm XM all the way.

Stickguy: Seems like the 3 has most, if not all, of the things you are looking for. If the price is right then go for it.

boomchek: Yeah, the Civic forum is a mess right now. A lot of ""trollesque"" posts over there."
4115	September 17, 2005 3:47PM	stickguy	"Stopped at the HOnda dealer with the family last night for a test sit (always a dangerous move). ANyway, my daughter liked the civic (because it was red, and she could keep tabs on how fast I am going with the digital speedo). My son liked the Accord, because he said the back seat was more comfy.

My wife seemed OK with the Civic, but liked the Accord better. She also makes a valid point that it would be better to have the bigger car with bigger trunk, since we would plan to take it on some trips when we don't need the cargo room of the Odyssey.

I also still haven't gotten myself comfortable in the drivers seat of the Civic. Spent 15 minutes in one on the showroom floor earlier in the day.

Saw a 3 earlier today (in a parking lot). Wife thought it looked small.

So, I think that I need to look more at ""mid size"" wheels. The current front runner is an EX-L 5 speed 4 cyl Accord, if a real good deal can be found. But, I sitll want to see the Fusion too.

I may also wait for the new IS250, but that's in a whole nother price range, and won't be helping MPG either."
4116	September 17, 2005 3:49PM	stickguy	the leater seats are quite comfortable. I still, however, have a problem with almost all cars without power seats. They seem to all be going to the 1-lever height adjustment, which tends to pitch you forward as it raises. I really prefer to have the front cushion tilted up (for thigh support), which pretty much requires a power seat.
4117	September 18, 2005 1:34PM	anonymousposts	"Got the Si washed. It's amazing how a simple car wash can make a car drive different.

The Accord had developed a slight vibration/pull in the tires so we got the alignment checked. That checked out fine so we got the tires rotated and balanced. Problem solved. We had a wash done on the Accord as well. Looks like a new car again.

I cane to the conclusion that Gee should not trade his Si any time soon. It's a great car and can't be beat for the price IMO. I'm also very attached to my Accord. It's really 95% of what I want in a car. It's safe, reliable, great gas mileage, XM radio, comfy seats, and good power.

stickguy: There are a few people in the Civic room saying that the tC is a better car than the Civic. What's your opinion?"
4118	September 18, 2005 1:42PM	stickguy	"hard to tell, partly because I haven't seen a coupe yet, just a 4 door. But, I would say that the Civic is every bit as good, and has better overall ride/handling. The tC does offer a lot of features for the money.

I'm assuming that newer tCs have resolved the squeak and creak problems of the early one.

Anyway, probably hard to go wrong with either one, and the differences will amount to personal taste.

Oh, and the Civic will likely get way better mileage."
4119	September 18, 2005 2:02PM	andre1969	still have better performance than the Civic, though? My impression of the tC was that it was kind of a mild musclecar, having a lightweight body with a larger Camry 4-cylinder thrown in. The previous Civic was a dog, unless you got that SI hatchback with the stronger engine. The new one, with 140 hp standard, should be much better, but I'd imagine a tC would still whoop its butt!
4120	September 18, 2005 11:54PM	anonymousposts	"the tC is a bit tubby for it's size. The MPG (22/29) is not that great for a small 4 cylinder car. It has a lot of content though .. which probably accounts for it's heft. I've seen 0-60 times in the high 7's-low 8's if I'm not mistaken.

We stopped by a Honda dealer on the way home from toy shopping today to check out the 06 Civic but they didn't have any. Gee saw an EX sedan there last week but it was nowhere to be found today."
4121	September 19, 2005 2:47AM	stickguy	"is a bit porky for ist size. Plus, it is geared really short, which helps account fo rthe mileage estimates.

But, to be fair, I average between 24 and 25 on most tanks, and that is real short hop around town for the most part. No real highway driving (maybe 3 miles at a time at cruising speeed). Mostly local stuff.

I would guess that switching to a 2006 Civic might get my normal driving up to maybe 30, but for ~100 miles per week, not a big savings."
4122	September 21, 2005 10:02AM	racer63	"Remember me? Last heard from heading off for a new job with car allowance? All which is going sort of OK, with less mileage accrued in the past 9 months on the daily driver than I was doing previously.

To keep this on topic, the household CEO/CFO is loosening the leash for me to consider buying something in the next 3-6 months. So many choices though. The basic criteria is 4 doors, maybe a wagon body, manual tranny, and have some kind of fun or bling factor. The list goes from PT Cruiser/HHR, through various Accords, TSX or TL's, and though it probalby will violate the stick requirement, CPO 3 series or C-class wagons.

I was considering buying something totally impratical and sporty, and to continue daily driving my almost 100k Celica, but a new work car is a more rational solution.

Sat in an HHR this week, and just couldn't get comfortable. The pedal/seat/steering wheel realationship was just all wrong. I'd probably get tired of the styling too after a while. I suppose the PT would be the same in that regard. But either is cheap. Accords are what they are, common middle ground plain vanilla. Either Acura would do the trick, but will both be some coin. Which leaves either of the German family trucksters, neither which I'd care to own without warranty, but both have been out for a while with '04 versions not necessarily having the teething troubles earlier years that those model runs have had. The local Benz dealer has a few Starmarked C240W's advertised for 26,999. I have a feeling the transaction price would be lower.....

I'll post as the search goes on. :P"
4123	September 23, 2005 8:01PM	michaellno	"But have moved from the reasearch to the shopping stage.

Still thinking about trading in the Focus for a similar car with an automatic for the daughter.

Stopped at the local Chevy and Ford dealer at lunch today to check out what they had. Saw an HHR for the first time --- not nearly as tall in person as it looked in the photos. Pretty well loaded for $16K - ABS, power everything, iPod jack in the stereo. Add another $1K for the slushbox and it's still a pretty good deal. The interior really impressed me - yes, there are still lots of plastics used, but the overall look and feel seemed to be above average.

No automatic Cobalt sedans available - the green pea salesman I had located one with a $17K MSRP. Since it was an '05 it would still qualify for the employee discount through next week. Not a huge issue as I get the supplier discount from GM, Ford and DCX.

Ford dealer next door only had 3 Foci that I saw - 1 ZX5 (w/ stick) and 2 ZX4s. One was an S trim, the other an SE. The SE had an auto but didn't have the cruise/tilt option, which is necessary for my daughter as she is pretty tall.

Have been checking out gmbuypower and similar sites for Ford and DCX to check local inventory.

The search continues...."

The '06 has the new looks (which work better on the Impreza line than the old looks) along with 8 more hp and FINALLY standard side airbags. The SE has the nice interior leather bits and the 260 watt six-disc changer with subwoofer. It's too bad that fuel economy has dropped a point, but it will still do WAY better than my old truck!

Reminds me - gotta sell my truck first though. :-)"

4127	September 24, 2005 8:56PM	michaellno	"First stop was the Saturn dealer to drive an '06 ION. Nice car, pretty well loaded for $16K (power everything, automatic, ABS/TC) except then the dealer added another $1K worth of ""accessories"" - pinstriping, mud guards, clear bra, etc. Drove quite nicely and the upgraded interior is eons better than what they offered in the past. I'm interested, as I can get the GM Supplier discount - now only if I could find one that hasn't had all the stuff added onto it.

Second stop was the Kia dealer to take a look at the Spectra. They had a couple of '05 EX trim levels on the lot - it, too, was loaded but no ABS available (even as an option!). Sticker said $15.9K. For what you're paying, not a bad little car. The only thing I had against the Kia was that the seat didn't seem to go far enough back and the bottom cushion was a bit short for me. Sales manager offered to let it go for $12,500 (rebates and discounts) before I could say ""hello"". Passed as the car would be for daughter, so she needs to evaluate it as well.

Don't know where either dealer would hit me on the trade in value of the Focus - I'm guessing between 7 and 8K - I owe just over $9K on it at the moment.

EDIT: also drove the newly introduced Kia Rio with an automatic. If you are desparate for a new car, you might consider one of these. Lots of goodies on the inside (including 6 airbags), but the powertrain hunts often to keep the momentum going. Might be better as a stick."
4128	September 24, 2005 9:59PM	nippononly	"Funny you should say that, I have thought from time to time over the years that I might like to take a job as a car salesman. I am afraid, though, that seeing the nitty-gritty business side of cars would take the fun out of my favorite hobby. :-(

Tried the internet quote route on a couple of dealers with regard to the OBS, got quotes back that are $1000 more than I would consider paying.

I think I am going to wait until the slow season after Christmas, rather than going in there knuckle to knuckle with some finance guy who thinks HIS Subarus are the best thing since sliced bread, and sweating hours and hours of my time to get that extra $1000. I mean, the weather is too nice this time of year for that. :-)"
4129	September 25, 2005 2:29AM	boomchek	"I had a customer who bought a car from me last year. In the span of a year he referred his 3 friends to me, his girlfriend, and the girlfriend's dad. During each deal he was present there and negotiating on their behalf since he knew how the process worked.

Eventually he liked it so much, he took an automotive sales course and now he's selling cars too

After you're in the business you do look at cars slightly differently though. When I started 2 years ago, I was getting excited over every car on the lot (new and used) and had to try and drive every one of them. After a while it starts to become a routine and I don't pay attention to them as closely as I did before (just another Accord/Civic etc... any accidents? what's the mileage, does it have a/c, and what are we asking for it)."

4132	September 25, 2005 12:17PM	lancerfixer	"WIth Mrs. Lance's Accord showing a progressively high component failure rate as time progresses (it IS 12 years old with an estimated ~200,000 on the broken odometer; this past week's adventure was a power window motor failure...stuck down, of course) I found myself at the local Honda joint looking at the '06 Civic.

Wow, what a quantum leap over the old Civic. I drove one of two they had at the dealer (they'd had five on the front line at one point; they were down to one outside and one in the showroom, both LX autos.)

First off, the dashboard/instrument cluster wasn't nearly as distracting as I thought it would be. Every other car I've driven with a digital speedometer annoyed me as the motion of the changing digits would catch the corner of my eye and would cause distraction. Somehow this doesn't happen with the Civic.

I was kind of surprised (and a little disappointed) the automatic was rated 2 highway MPG higher than the manual; it's kinda tough because this would be a purely highway commuting car (Mrs. Lance racks up close to 400 mi/week) so when it comes down to it, we'll both have to make the mileage vs. fun value judgement.

Interior room feels about the same as our '94 Accord, though of course with all the modern safety goodies (kudos to Honda for making ABS, side/head bags, etc standard instead of some asinine option package or an EX only thing, like other competitors in the segment.) As I mentioned, I came away really liking the dashboard. There were a couple of areas that the interior plastics seemed just a tad on the cheapish side, like on the door panels. If that's the compromise to get all the other features of the Civic at a manageable price point, though, I'd be able to live with that.

The automatic did a really good job, as slushboxes go; much smoother than Honda autos of the past (which frankly wouldn't have been hard to do anyway.) Handling is, of course, Honda-precise. I'd still want to drive the stick.

We'd both really like the Accord to at least last through the winter; we'll be in a much better financial position in the spring to be able to afford a payment. When the time comes, though...the '06 Civic just got bumped to the top of the list of potential replacements (and I said I'd never buy a new car...)"
4133	September 25, 2005 1:00PM	stickguy	"go with the stick since you want it 9when it doubt, take fun). Anyway, when did everyone start taking the EPA figures as gospel (just go check out the Odyssey MPG board!).

I think (occasionally) that the stick will still return as good or better mileage overall as the AT. Maybe if you truly do all highway cruising there might be a difference, but still 38 isn't going to break you."
4134	September 25, 2005 1:11PM	lancerfixer	"Yeah. Plus, of course, the stick is cheaper to buy in the first place.
On the other hand, traffic on Mrs. Lance's commute (I-380, Cedar Rapids to Iowa City) has picked up substantially in the past few years as both cities grow quickly. A few months ago, she took my car (the slushbox Volvo) to work and remarked when she got home that she was glad to have it that day since traffic was unusually heavy (stop and go...on the interstate! In Iowa! Thought we'd left MA/NH to get away from all that...) It might just be a matter of time before she breaks down and wants an auto, anyway..."
4135	September 25, 2005 3:25PM	corvette	38 or 40 MPG--both are probably higher than what the Accord gets.
4136	September 25, 2005 6:10PM	woodyww	"I've been getting Prius Fever, altho I haven't driven one yet. My problem is, I'm used to driving bmw's, Range Rovers, a Saab 9000, so I don't know how deprived I'll feel going to a smaller economy car. Also, my 2000 528i Wagon (Touring) has only 24K miles on it, so I don't have much excuse to sell it. It gets about 17mgp city & low-mid 20's highway, so rationally, not putting on a lot of miles, it wouldn't be worth it to trade for a Prius. Altho it's already $50-$60 to totally fill up the 528i; will be a real drag if gas goes higher.

I supppose I could order a Prius, drive it when it comes in, & decide. And even keep the bmw for awhile so I don't have seller's remorse while I get used to the Prius. And if I wind up hating & selling the prius; I think they have great resale. Unfortunately, I couldn't really afford to keep both.

One more wrinkle: I really like having cargo capacity, with a hatch (another reason for the Prius as opposed to a Civic, say). Altho I have considered a new 4 or 6 cyl. Accord.

Any of this make any sense? (Or not?) Advice?"
4137	September 25, 2005 7:48PM	akangl	"With all this good pricing going on a diesel is looking extremely tempting, I could easily trade the Titan in and get into a nice diesel 3/4 ton. Problem is I LOVE my Titan. I've also thought about consigning the Titan, could get out of it easily that way, but dang I love that truck.

Guess its just my CCB side talking........have had the truck nearly a year and 20k miles."
4138	September 25, 2005 9:19PM	michaellno	"today and decided that ABS is a non-negiotiable ""must have"" if (and its a very large if) we decide to trade in the Focus for a new car for the daughter. That rules the Spectra out.

How much are the new Civic's going for, anyway? Perhaps an LX might work, if all those safety features are standard.

ION for $16K still seems to be a good deal, if I could find one without all the dealer add on crap.

Bottom line is, like Jolie, I like where I am, vehicle wise (and financially, as well)."
4139	September 25, 2005 11:05PM	corvette	"The Prius driving experience will not be nearly as involving as what you're used to in a BMW or Saab. I think it's about like a Camry or Corolla. The Prius is really cool, and I respect it for what it is, but I know it's not for me.

michaell,
I think a Civic LX is in the same price range as the Ion. My own experience has been that it's possible to get an objectively good deal on a new and popular model if you shop around."
4140	September 26, 2005 12:30AM	chrisbgood	"Has me thinking Mini Cooper (fun, with all the stuff for safety on it standard -- can be had for 17,000 brand new, or 18 with the auto tranny and the first three years of maintenance for everything but tires is included free). Mini vs. Saturn Ion -- no contest. Has it been that long since I shopped cars? The Saturn (risk of being a Saturn basher) is a good 12k car or there abouts -- same as the Focus and Kia.

The Civic is bigger and an excellant option though. If you want inexpensive the Sentra is a decent deal although dated. And if you don't want options (or do want to spend a lot) the Toyota is an excellant car."
4141	September 26, 2005 1:00AM	lancerfixer	"Having just looked extensively at the Civic this weekend, I can say that ABS, side and head curtain airbags are all standard on even the DX. I was glad to see Honda step up in this class.

I've driven an Ion and the new Civic, and frankly there's simply no comparison. The new Civic is twice the car the Ion could hope to be."
4142	September 26, 2005 2:45AM	woodyww	"Yeah........the prius is probably just a Pipe Dream. I have previously vowed to keep the E-39 until it's 9 or 10 years old. And last I looked, it might bring about $18K. It's such a great car, with such low miles, it's like, why sell it now that (hopefully) it's taken the brunt of the depreciation?

It can get expensive being hooked on German cars. But one of the things that strikes me is, this 6 y.o. bmw has had virtually Japanese-car reliability (not to brag, I don't want to jinx it). It was made in Dingolfing (sp?), & is built like a Tank. And actually, my previous bmw, an E-24 6 Series, didn't have much of anything go wrong until about 8-9 years old, & even then it was fairly routine stuff, altho definitely more expensive & complicated than a Toyota.

Uh, sorry for all the bmw talk, if it bores anyone. I keep trying to find reasons to buy a Toyota or a Honda, for practical reasons. Maybe if I could afford to buy an S2000, & keep the 5-series wagon......."
4143	September 26, 2005 12:28PM	michaellno	"Trust me, if the kid had her way, there would be a Mini Cooper parked in the driveway. Have actually looked at a couple of used ones. Downsides, as I see them:

--> requires premium fuel
--> only 2 doors, so will jack up the insurance and reduce the practicality

Thanks for the confirmaiton of the safety features of the new Civic. May have to check one out see ... what about keyless remote? Available? Optional?"
4144	September 26, 2005 1:09PM	danf1	The true danger of working in the car business is that you are always tempted to buy something. I am not looking for a car today, but if I see a deal that makes sense, I might buy a car today. It is definitely good for maintaining a proper CCB membership.
4145	September 26, 2005 1:33PM	qbrozen	"So... let's see... I think I bought my Lincoln LS 2 weeks ago? Anyway, we traded our '03 Pilot for a new '05 Pacifica this weekend. My wife is enjoying all the extra features. The power rear liftgate is neat. I didn't want satellite radio, but it has it and its free for a year, so I'll check it out. I haven't even tried the DVD player yet.

Why did we trade? I have no idea now. Sounded like a plan when I did it. We did lower our payments and now she has a vehicle with no miles as opposed to 49K. Pilot needed tires real soon, so now we got out of that, too. We're happy so far."

4147	September 26, 2005 3:40PM	corvette	"One reason for the reliability could be that you haven't put many miles on it.

My 325i has a rattle or two and a chronic ""low battery"" warning light when running the accessories with the engine off, even if the battery is fully charged. I need to order winter wheels and tires."
4148	September 26, 2005 3:40PM	michaellno	"congrats on the new cars, but i gotta ask --

you lowered the payments, but do you have more payments to make?

I know, it's anti-CCBA to even mention fiscal responsibility, but that is one of the main reasons why I haven't pulled the trigger on a deal and trade in the Focus. I only have 30 payments left - but, if I trade it in for something new, the payments will be about the same, but i'm looking at 48 or 60 months.

If I could convince the Mrs. to find a late model used car for the kid and stick with a 3 year note, I could probably get into something around $9 or $10K pretty easily. The downside is finding a car that has the equipment on it we want (automatic, ABS and keyless remote, specifically) in that price range.

Hope you enjoy the Pacifica and the LS!"
4149	September 26, 2005 3:43PM	corvette	"The base Mini Cooper should run happily on mid-grade, and electronic stability control is also an option if you're looking for safety features (if I could only choose one, I would take ESC over side airbags, you're much more likely to use the ESC).

I think the Civic includes remote locks starting with the LX. The DX has no standard aircon, and adding it brings the price up to within spitting distance of the LX."
4150	September 26, 2005 3:58PM	woodyww	"Yeah, the low miles can really help lower the maint. & repair costs, esp. on an expensive Euro-car.

How old is your 325i? BTW I ordered Dunlop Winter Sport M3's, after selling a set of Michelin Artic Alpins that were OK in the snow, but the Dunlops are supposed to be much better. I scored a set of almost-new 16"" bmw rims for cheap, but I kind of wish I'd just ordered the after-market wheels with the tires already mounted & balanced......"
4151	September 26, 2005 4:09PM	woodyww	Uh......you have an excuse to get a Mini Cooper? Will you be able to drive it much yourself? If so, I'd already be filling out the order form & obsessing over the colors. BTW, I'd get every safety feature they offer, inc. side airbags.....

4155	September 26, 2005 5:32PM	qbrozen	"yes, i still have the alfa. and i still have the volvo. Trading the Z for the LS got us the cash we were looking for. Trading the Pilot for the Pacifica just got us a bit more monthly cash to apply to child care.

Yes, its definitely more payments (we basically just hit that reset switch on the payment cycle). But, its highly unlikely we would have kept the Pilot past the period we would have been making payments. It already had near 50K miles in just 2.5 years. The wife is driving less now, so the Pacifica shouldn't rack them up as fast.

And, yes, that is anti-CCB'er of you to ask. I think you should have to sit in the penalty box until you've learned your lesson.

So, let's see, on top of the 2 cars within a couple of weeks, there was the Z purchase 6 months ago, and the old Benz purchase 6 months before that. So that's 4 within a year. The Benz and Z are both gone. Obviously, based on these habits, I don't think my volvo has anything to worry about in terms of most miles I've put on one car. 82K and counting since I purchased it 4 years ago."

Yeah, I'm about ready to turn in my CCBA membership card. I've got a perfect opportunity to trade in one of my vehicles and get something new, and I'm not able to pull the trigger!

Sheesh.

woody - don't know how much of this thread you've been through, but the Focus would be traded in for something with an automatic for my 17 year old daughter to drive. Currently, she's driving my '03 Saturn L300 (leather, V6, sunroof) while I'm driving the Focus.

She wants a Mini Cooper; dad thinks that she's asking a lot. Her second choice is a Scion xA; OK, that's a bit better (read: cheaper) but, as stated above, I'm not sure that I want to start over with a new set of car payments.

On top of which, she's a senior in HS and is looking to head off to college next year in a town where on-campus parking is at a premium and jobs for college age kids are tough to come by (she would need the job to pay for gas and insurance for whatever ride she has).

There is one possible scenario where she doesn't have a car at all - either we sell it outright or we take it off active insurance except for when she's home in the summer.

So, now it's looking as if we'll wait until next year to see where we stand, both college and job wise, before making any sort of decision.

I'm thinking of putting 16"" wheels and tires onto the Focus -- gotta be a lot cheaper than a whole new car - if I'm going to continue driving it."

I'm not worried about it leaving me stranded, but on its one trip to the dealer, they failed to address any of the issues...

Not a whole lot of winter tire selection, if I stick to run-flats. Oh, Kumho, Nokian, and others make and sell run-flats in other countries, just not here. It seems as if the US market always gets deprived of the good stuff!

Side airbags are standard on the Mini, DSC is available at minimal cost. They are really a hoot to drive!"
4159	September 26, 2005 8:49PM	corvette	"Just read Edmunds' first drive of the Civic. The styling is attractive, but were the wheels on the hybrid designed to look like hubcaps?

I've noticed this trend with a lot of cars and some or all of their factory wheel options:
Toyota Highlander Limited
Lexus SC430
Volvo S80
Honda Insight
Honda Civic Hybrid

One of the features of alloy wheels is that they allow large openings that are impossible with a conventional steel wheel and hubcap. Let me see the brakes, for crying out loud!"
4160	September 27, 2005 12:53AM	chrisbgood	"Side air bags standard. DSC dirt cheap. ABS standard. Insurance (standard Cooper) very cheap. Cool car? Yes! Fun to drive? Definately! easiest car to park in small spots, bar none -- competent on the highway and it handles beautifully.

(OK, I miss the Cooper -- I owned one for one year, traded it in for more than I paid for it -- list -- cost of ownership = 0 for year 1).

They run fine on regular -- and gas milege is good."
4161	September 27, 2005 12:58AM	racer63	"I had about an hour and a half to kill with the family over the weekend, and thought it was time to introduce them to what I'm considering for my next ride.

First stop was at the Acura dealer for TL's and TSX's, and all the response I got from Mrs. Racer was a frowny face over $33k on the sticker. My 8 and 9 year olds, who only think Acuras and BMWs are real cars, weren't even with me, since my son wants a RSX Type S and nothing else.

Next was Honda, and thay had an '06 5 speed Accord EX 4 door right out front. $23k, so the price was in the right direction for the Mrs., who clearly is her father's daughter, the man who still drives a 1990 Tempo. Her words, delivered in monotone, was: What's not to like. Kids thought it was boring.

Since I knew we still hadn't reached her price point nirvana yet, and it was in the direction we had to go, the Chevy dealer was last, to show her the HHR. Which upon sight all she could do was laugh. We all piled in the one in the showroom, and after about 20 seconds, the kids were mortified to be seen in it, and my wife still hadn't stopped cackling. She thought it was the perfect old mans car. This particular one was a 5-speed, and while with more fiddling I was able to get an acceptable driving position, it did require a double jointed right elbow to operate the shifter with the right armrest down on the seat. And they wonder why nobody buys manual trannys anymore.

All said and done, nobody liked anything. To be continued with another installment after our next go-around."

...I see the alternator (Red Battery) indicator flash. It would flash about three times and stop. May have done this three or four times. Car is running fine. So I take the emergency turn around, go home, and get the truck.

I sent him the link to the First Drive of the 2006 Civic. (I also suggested some components to check, but those won't really take care of the root cause in the same way the Civic would...)"

Yes, it cuts down on the drag coefficient."
4164	September 28, 2005 2:20PM	anonymousposts	We have been good for over a year now. Last CCB decision was trading the 04 EX-L automatic Accord for the EX-L 5-speed. That said, there was a pristine G35 Coupe 6-speed in our showroom. Only 17,000 miles. Silver/light gray leather. I almost did what any good wife would do and buy the car for Gee. He could have driven it for a few days and then decided whether he wanted to sell the Si/LS and keep the G35. I could have gotten it for $27,000. Not bad. But it had the wrong interior color and it would be better for us to wait until the mini-van goes back before buying another car. Besides, now Gee wants a Freestyle. We need to go test drive one. If we could get it for $22,000-$25,000 with the options we want then it could be a contender. Anything over $25,000 and I would rather have an Odyssey/used MDX.
4165	September 28, 2005 6:56PM	manamal	That is impressive (2 cars in one month)....My best is 3 cars in 9 months (and two in three months). And, I ditched a car wit fewer miles than AKANG puts on while going to the market.
4166	September 28, 2005 11:35PM	corvette	"A Freestyle? Lease another Odyssey, or buy yours out of the lease. The Mazda5 looks interesting, ""stop sale"" order due to fire hazard notwithstanding."
4167	September 29, 2005 3:35AM	stickguy	"It's time to get off.

Finally saw/sat in /drove a Fusion tonight (an SE 4 cyl 5 speed, so the mid grade model). Loved it. Drove great, nice handling , steering feel, smooth clutch and nice tight short-throw shifter. Best of all, the front seats were great. The drivers seat felt like it was designed for me, and even adjusted the way I liked (you could tilt the front cushion edge way up, and the cushion itself was nice and long for thigh support.

Also lots of room inside, and a large trunk.

Sticker prety well loaded up was only 21K, before the assorted expected discounts.

It has what I want, so I plan to persue this one. It helps that my neighbor is the GSM at the Ford dealer close to my office!

My wife decided to pull a snob act (eew, it's a Ford), but she knows diddle about cars. I had to explain the Mazda heritage to her, and the fact that the Honda's we looked at were made in the US, not the Fusion!

Anyway, that's why I leave her out of the process now. I gave her a chance."
4168	September 29, 2005 5:09AM	akangl	"Meant to call my Ford salesguy tonight about an F-350. I'm getting the itch........BAD!!! The Titan is GREAT, a wonderful truck, but it can't haul ANYTHING in the bed. I'd LOVE to have an F-350 dually diesel, would be perfect to help out our business...........which is overrun with orders!!!!!

I dunno, I really love my Titan."
4169	September 29, 2005 1:30PM	guss	"Do you think the Ford dealer will move much off sticker?

A buddy of mine put his name on the list to check out the Fusion and the dealer called last night. I'll probably go with him after work to check it out.

He had a seat problem with the Mazda6 also. Not enough thigh support, so your appraisal of the seat is encouraging."
4170	September 29, 2005 1:33PM	stickguy	like night and day to the 6. Much bigger cushion, and shaped better. I found the 6 to have too short a bottom cushion, and had lumps in the wrong places. the back seat also seems much roomier (head and leg room), since it is slightly bigger, and has a boxier shape. That swoopy styling does take a toll on rear space.
4171	September 29, 2005 1:38PM	stickguy	"Forgotthat part. They only had 2, and the sales guy thought the real volume supply wouldn't start hitting for a couple of weeks. I didn't bother to talk price (it would have been an order at this point anyway), because I have a contact at another dealer (the GSM).

Anyway, I expect pricing to get aggressive pretty quick, although it really is priced well to start with (lower than the competition for the most part at MSRP). But, with the volumes they want to sell, and the fact that it is a domestic (feeling the qftershocks of employee pricing), they should be dealing sooner rather than later.

I hope to get an invoice deal from my contact, plus there is at least $500 FMC cash out the gate, and I heard something about a DP match of another $500, but not sure if that is true.

Sticker on an SE the way I want it is ~21k, invoice ~ 19.5K, less the cash incentives and we are at ~18.5-19K, which I would pay for that package.

Of course, who knows what pricing will be in the middle of the winter if they are piling up on the lots.

besides, I am just happy that they are making stick shift models from the beginning!"

I picked up a one year old 6 wagon for about 25% of what I would have paid new.

Hopefully, if the rumor of the Freestyle going to Mercury is true,Ford will get a wagon version of the Fusion. I love my 6 but some of the union people I work with are not."

I'm may be cooling on my Prius obsession. Altho I can order one, MSRP, $500 refundable deposit. I'm thinking, if gas prices are the same, or higher, when I get it, I could unload it after a time & not lose much(?). Plus there's a $2K or $3K tax credit early next year.

I do get periodic Mini cravings however; altho I haven't driven one yet. I'd go for an S. There again, I'd hope I could unload it after a time & not lose much(?). But the sales tax & insurance in Taxachusetts make buying a 2nd car somewhat prohibitive......I dig the Mini colors tho, IMO the best selection of colors of any current car."
4176	September 29, 2005 10:26PM	corvette	Already bought 4 run-flats, and it was cheaper to pay a little extra for the RFs than to get another rim, and carry it around along with a jack, etc.

Hell, the insurance on the LS is already too freaking high. At least this time I might actually drive the car.

That was the fastest car I think I ever drove. Very fun. I would have lost my license in no time.

the miles are scary, expecially if it hasn't gone through a lot of recent service (meaning that all the wear items will come due on your dime).

Still, if you buy it, don't let it sit and rot, not that I expect you would be able to (after becoming addicted).

Too bad I never see things like this. I wouldn't drop 25K on it, but if it was clean, for 16K I would buy it without thinking twice. But, I also don't put on a lot of miles (maybe 8K a year now), so I could milk it.

It's deals like this that make me think I'm nuts to buy a new econo car like a Fusion or Accord. Only problem is, these deals never fall into my lap!"
4187	September 30, 2005 3:35AM	corvette	At least you won't have to worry about keeping the miles off it!

I could have had it for cheap but I didn't have extra disposable income for repairs or maintenance if anything would have gone wrong. So make sure you put some money aside for repairs cause they ain't gonna be cheap. :sick:

4192	September 30, 2005 2:58PM	stickguy	"55K in 18 months? Was he visiting AK?

Hmm, wonder if he bought it CPO so it would have a warranty out to 100K?

4194	September 30, 2005 3:37PM	corvette	Even if it's CPO, as has been speculated, it's nearly out of warranty. If your dealership doesn't sell BMW's, I'd find an independent mechanic that specializes in them.

There's a local used car dealer that lists ""no-haggle"" prices that are really competitive, so I use them to have an idea what to shoot for on certain cars. They have 2004 6 wagons (which all have the V6) priced from 13,7 to 14,5 depending on mileage, which 1-2k cheaper then similar 4-cyl sedans.

Hah, NOBODY can justify a 540 based on practicality. The good thing is you don't have to.
In your situation the main thing I would look for is is there a good/cheap mechanic near you who you trust to work on the 540 for maintenance. (non-dealer).

If the answer is yes, definitely go for it."
4199	September 30, 2005 8:55PM	gee35coupe	"That needed a new engine. I found that BMW specialists aren't that expensive. They aren't cheap. But then again I also have had a couple Lexus's that I DID have serviced at the dealer. I decided the 528 wasn't ""special"" enough to warrant the trouble.

I really DON'T need that car though. I have a foot like lead on Jupiter. I've sold 3 true sports cars because I drive too fast. But I just can't help the deal on that car. If I don't buy it, the guy who would works with Anony. I'll take pics either way. It's so sweet."
4200	September 30, 2005 8:56PM	woodyww	It must have the Sport Pckg. right? Color(s)? I saw a nice dark blue 540i Sport at Costco today, was trying not to drool admidst the sea of Highlanders. I was gonna say tho, just have it checked out thoroughly by a really good bmw mechanic. And if it has lots of service records, better yet. There are some issues with the V8's & the cooling systems, but you probably already know that, & sounds like you have $$ budgeted for upgrades or maintenence. BTW, did you ask Terry what it's worth?
4201	September 30, 2005 10:11PM	corvette	"I have a foot like lead on Jupiter.

I've behaved well, lately, but I do figure that if I could ever afford an M5, it would probably be the last car I have the opportunity to buy!

I just watched Top Gear's review of the new M5. They had some mechanical problems, and the satnav kept telling them to ""turn left a half mile ahead,"" but they still loved it (and it turned in an amazing laptime)."

4204	October 1, 2005 2:03PM	ghulet	...I dunno, if you're in the position and it's something you guys want, I say 'go for it'. Seems that the BMW wouldn't be your main daily driver, so I don't think the miles are especially an issue (and, despite relatively high repair costs, it's not like BMWs don't last), except in that they're in your favor as far as price goes. I know I'm enabling, but I also can't think you could probably drive this thing for a couple years and almost get all your money back out of it, if you don't rack up too many more miles.
4205	October 1, 2005 2:07PM	ghulet	.....unfortunately, it's not for me, but then again, it's kinda fun to spend someone else's money. I'm going with my friend Diane to replace her '95 Integra (which has a bit over 35k!), with most likely either an '06 Acura RSX or '06 Civic coupe. Unfortunately, the Civic coupes aren't even in at the dealer we're going to (at least they weren't earlier in the week), so it's likely we'll have to drive a sedan and, if she decides she likes it, order the coupe. I'm trying to help her be patient, I'd rather see her in the Civic than the RSX honestly, since the Civic is brand new this year (and she's keeping cars like ten years at this point), since she pretty much drives to the store and the train. Also, rumours abound that the RSX will get the axe for '07.

Oh and I got a new job, was hired today, so have to give my 2 weeks notice at my other job when I get off my week's vacation (will probably do it Friday). So now instead of driving 164 miles/day I'll only be driving 52 miles/day. Gas will go from $320/mo to $85/mo.

4212	October 2, 2005 4:58PM	woodyww	I'm curious as to what an '01 540i with 90K+ miles is really worth. I'd think it's gotta(?) be worth the $16K(?). But I have been more aware recently of how fast bmw's depreciate (as in, checking the value of my 2000 528i with miniscule miles). Lately I've been really glad I have the I6 instead of the V8 when I buy gas. I do admit to having a certain kind of envy (akin to what Freud popularized) when I see a 540i tho. Bummer it doesn't have service records--would be great if it had a lot of stuff already replaced.....I'd budget $1K to $2K per year for maint. & repairs on a car like that......btw can I drive it?
4213	October 2, 2005 8:11PM	ghulet	"OK, so I spent the day car shopping with my friend yesterday, looking to buy either a Civic or RSX. Here's a brief-as-possible breakdown.

First stop, impromptu visit to Mitsu dealer (in Matteson, IL auto mall with ~20 makes) to test drive an Eclipse (she thought it was 'cute'). She actually liked it (we tested a 4-cyl GS with sunroof and upgraded Fosgate stereo), so did I but I knew it never really was in the running, she's a Honda loyalist. Good stereo, but some strange ergonomics (climate and stereo readouts in the center of upper dash), one of the raspier-sounding fours I've heard in a while, and the body was a bit bulbous compared to a Civic or RSX. Also, it has a four-speed auto where the other two have five. That said, the sticker was a reasonable ~$22k, and I think we could have knocked a bit off that, given how Mitsus are selling now.

Second stop, closest Honda dealer, at the same auto mall. They had exactly ONE '06 Civic (a black with tan cloth LX coupe) in stock, already sold, so we couldn't even test drive. Our salesguy was a green pea (first week), nice guy, then we got a 'closer' who really tried to get us to put down a deposit ('but it's refundable', he says--on a car we hadn't even driven); we said no, at which point he basically implied that we were out of luck. We had already given the salesguy her info and what we'd like, so after that we were on our way.

Third, another Honda dealer. They had four '06 Civics (including a beautiful Atomic Blue EX sedan I loved), we test drove an EX coupe automatic; nice car, and I even fit OK in the back seat with the sunroof (I'm 6'0""). She seemed to like it quite a bit, but the coupe we drove was white/tan (I advised to never buy any car with light tan cloth), so they would have to locate what she wanted. I should note that neither dealer had a manual Civic, and I didn't see any manual Accords, though I didn't look thoroughly and both dealers had tons of them. Just an aside, am I the only one who thinks almost $20k ($19610 MSRP for an EX automatic, and nobody's discounting a cent) for a 140hp Civic is a bit crazy?

On to the Acura dealer, just down the street. We test drove a base, leather, automatic RSX in white, not her color choice. After I compared stats between it and the Integra, I figured (since I wasn't aware yet, the salesguy confirmed) that they were built off the same platform. Bottom line, she drove it (said it felt 'natural', can't imagine why!), loved it and put down a deposit on one in Jade Green metallic; salesguy claims they sell a lot in that color. Funny, I've never seen one, and the closest I could find on AutoTrader was in Kansas City (~400 miles away). I'm happy for her, though I probably would have chosen the Civic (though I'm a sedan guy, hands down), just for the $3k savings (she's also paying MSRP on the RSX), the fact that it's a 'newer' car and that the RSX is supposedly a lame duck; she keeps cars ten years, after all. But, in her defense, she felt better in the RSX, the dash is definitely less fussy, controls more user friendly (and she's 4'11"", so reachability is an issue) and the RSX has leather (big mistake not offering it in upper Civics, IMO).

Oh yeah, both the Honda and Acura dealers offered her $3k in trade on her Integra. It's only got 35k but does have a couple issues (pretty seriously oxidized paint, a bit of the usual rust on both rear wheelwells, fussy driver's window switch, glitchy power locks), but the interior is decent, the stereo, antenna, windows and roof work fine and the air is ICE cold. Runs great, too (I drove all day); reminds me, especially on the interstate, why I'd never get a 4-cylinder automatic, though; had to plan those passing maneuvers, definitely. She doesn't want to sell it on her own (she's single, 4'11"" and 62 years old, I don't blame her), she's got a friend interested in it for her teenager (perfect!), but if that doesn't work out, it will be traded. She'd also get the tax savings on the trade (~$200, big deal)."

Or even if you get into a period where it needs new exhaust, new suspension, cooling system repairs, etc., you could run up $5-$6K of repair bills in a heartbeat. I've noticed even some of the most hard-core bmw fanatics start to fret as their warranties run out.....If it was me, I'd up the budget by what? $7K? & get an E-39 530i with 1/2 the miles (or less). Maybe even CPO.

4218	October 3, 2005 5:51PM	ghulet	"Yeah, it is kind of strange to see a woman her age driving an Integra or RSX. She's single, her son is long since married (he was one of my best childhood friends), so she doesn't really need 'practical' (though the hatchback has come in handy many times, she says). She had an '86 Accord before the Integra, and, would you believe a '79 Grand Marquis before that? Her cars are getting younger.

Fin, the condition, I guess, isn't as bad as I make it sound; it's a great '20 footer', as they say. The rust on the wheelwells is very minor, no holes and it's only visible up close; the oxidation is visible, kinda looks like frost, probably the result of the combination of extremes we get here in weather, and the fact that it's a dark color. Oh yeah, and no garage, no shade in the driveway."
4219	October 3, 2005 6:39PM	gee35coupe	"The last Integra still had wishbones they started with struts with the RSX.

As far as maint on the Bimmer...As long as the engine/tranny doesn't go south I feel I'd be okay. I have no problem getting salvage parts and as far as the exhaust...I'm already thinking Dinan for a lot of stuff. My budget was up to $37k for a G35 coupe. But a $16k 540 is an easy compromise. I figure if I keep it running 5 years I'd probably lose 16K in depreciation on anything new that compares. If I spend another $10K on this thing it better have a supercharger.

Which by the way would get me over 400hp.

Anony wouldn't let me."
4220	October 3, 2005 7:40PM	stickguy	"actually talked numbers. But, since the dealer didn't say something that sounded good, I left in the old wheels.

The Honda place happened to have a couple of left over 2005 EX-L 5 speed Accords. Drove one, and it was very nice, and would probably be a great car to keep for the next 10 years. Not exciting, but comfortable and nice driving.

But, they seemed to think it should be priced like an '06 (I probably would have taken the offer if it was!), and had a much different opinion of the value of my current car than Terry did, so no deal.

The Accord was silver, probably not my first choice, so it would have to be a hell of an offer to make me pull the trigger (probably 4K less difference). But, at least we are moving closer to something!"

I have located what seems to be the last 5 speed manual 4WD in the Bay Area, drove it tonight, dealer won't budge below invoice. Left in my own car, but have not dismissed it yet. I liked the drive more than I thought I would, it would be the perfect snow car that I could still drive to work every day. Am going to see if anyone will offer me any money for my car...

Snow car. You live in the bay area don't you.
Any car with 4 wheels is the perfect snow car in the bay area."
4228	October 4, 2005 2:00PM	corvette	"It's funny you mention that... Right after the Freestyle came out, I saw one on the interstate filled up with stuff, and the low-hanging tailpipe was about to drag the ground!

Did I ever post my theory on the 1996-generation Explorer rollovers? This may have no scientific basis, but here goes: I noticed a ton of Explorers that, when traveling at interstate speed, would ""lean"" backwards--the rear end of the truck would squat down close to the ground. Perhaps they were carrying a lot of cargo, but it doesn't make sense, given the number of these that I saw. I suspect that some combination of bad aerodynamics pushed the rear of the car down too hard at high speed, placing more weight than was intended on the rear axle. Carrying rear passengers or cargo would only compound this effect. Perhaps this was intended to provide additional rear traction and stability to prevent oversteer, but became dangerous when the car was loaded down. With the rear axle loaded down in this manner, the tires are probably above their weight limits at the recommended pressure (26 psi?), and are being subjected to more impact harshness and stress when driving over pockmarked pavement due to the reduced suspension travel caused by the loading of the live rear axle. This is the perfect recipe for overloading and blowing out a rear tire, which is very likely to result in a loss of control. Also, the lack of downward force on the front end of the car would make it much harder to steer, making it easier to lose control...

So, did I earn my pseudo-expert witness badge with that? :P"
4229	October 4, 2005 2:18PM	bobw3	Maybe that's why the Freestyle has a fifth wheel on the bottom of the muffler!
4230	October 4, 2005 2:43PM	nippononly	"We were somewhere around $2000 apart, considering my car as a trade. I am hoping to pick up the 2 grand by selling it privately, in which case I am willing to pay invoice for the RAV.

I DID see that the next RAV will have an optional V-6 and lots of other ""improvements"". With the extension of the platform to allow for a third row seat it will have (optional), I figure it will be about as big as the current Highlander, which is bigger than I would like. The thing is, the current model is so maneuverable because it has such a short wheelbase, which is why I like it. Plus half my aim here is to get a four-door for carrying kids in the back, which the back seat of the current RAV is certainly big enough to do. Wouldn't put two adult friends back there for more than an hour though.

zodiac: I appreciate your perspective, but the reason I want 4WD for snow trips is that CHP generally lets 4WDs go by without installing chains, except in blizzard conditions. It is also a good dirt road car, which I do plenty of when I camp."

4235	October 4, 2005 5:47PM	nippononly	"the new RAV will be just long enough for the third row to be an afterthought that can only really seat children, which is what the Highlander's is now. But then the Highlander will be all-new for the 2007 MY, arriving six to nine months after the new RAV, and I am sure that will get commensurately longer too so that Toyota's own models don't step on each other's toes.

The current Highlander is a big vehicle for my tastes. I don't need the back seat every day, just a couple times a week. The AWD I need 15 long weekends a year. :-)"
4236	October 4, 2005 6:20PM	andre1969	"was interested in the RAV4, until someone at his job badmouthed it. The parents of one of his co-workers has one, and supposedly she borrowed it a few times, and ragged on how slow it was. She said that when you turn the a/c on, out on the highway, it really kills the car's power. Well, the same thing happens to my buddy's Tracker when he turns the a/c on, so it gave him enough of a deja vu to cross it off his list!

But doesn't the RAV4 have a Camry engine in it? Seems to me that should be enough to power something like a RAV. And incidentally, another vehicle on his list is the Element. But since that one has an Accord engine, which is about the same size/power as the Camry, it seems to me that theoretically it would have the same problem with a/c!

Anyway, I told him that he should at least try the RAV out, but he won't listen. Still, even if the a/c does kill the car's power, I'm sure it's still gotta perform better than his Tracker would!"
4237	October 4, 2005 6:54PM	stickguy	I'm doing this from memory, but I think it has a 2.0l engine, more of a COrolla than Camry level. The Highlander uses the Camry 2.4l as the base engine.
4238	October 4, 2005 7:53PM	nippononly	"that 2.4 is the RAV's only engine,and yes it is the Camry engine. The difference between Element and RAV is about 500 pounds in the AWD. The Element is a porker, and fuel economy suffers proportionally.

When I test drive, I make a practice of leaving the A/C on the entire time, even if it is chilly out. Gives you an idea of how much the power suffers with it on. The RAV is plenty spritely enough with it running, I wouldn't call it slow. It is geared about the same as my RSX, and has about the same torque-to-weight ratio (is there such a thing?!), so it feels peppy on the street and has decent passing power at highway speeds."
4239	October 4, 2005 8:14PM	paulhuang	I think the first generation RAV4 had a 2.0 liter engine. I can see how that can be totally sapped on the highway with the AC on. The current ones have a 2.4 liter engine, so it should be fine on power.
4240	October 5, 2005 12:38AM	fitguy	"You have a good observation on '96-'01 Explorers- the have a weak rear suspension. I had a '97 V8 w/tow package, rated 6400 lbs, and even with moderate tongue weight it sagged like crazy. Power and gearing were correct, suspension was not. I just got an '05 Explorer V8 and the difference is astounding.
And it has a 3rd row seat you can actually fit an adult up to about 6' for short trips, maybe up to an hour. These manufacturers that are clamoring to stuff a 3rd row seat into a small SUV are idiots- most won't even fit a child (ie, Pathfinder and Highlander).
Anyhow, I ramble- my post was to say I now have 1 brand-new and 1 nearly-new vehicles and now I am looking to find a used Miata for warm-weather fun. I know I am sick but judging by the other posts here, apparently not alone! :shades:"

Her comments were that the Malibu Maxx was very plain up close, and the interior was cheap (and the Tahoe interior isn't?). She liked the Vibe interior a lot. All of the cars we looked at appeared to be ex-rentals, but the worst one of all was the Malibu with only 5,000 miles on it!

Maybe a bit smaller. Have to agree with you on the Highlander - that back seat is completely pointless. The worst offender has to be the Caddy SRX. Try to climb in there are an auto show or something and you'll see what I mean. Not only is there no leg room, but the bottom of the seat is only like 4 inches off the floor, so even kids have their knees up in their chins.

4244	October 5, 2005 5:03PM	andre1969	I'm probably looking at this from a different perspective, but so far the only SUV I've seen with what I'd consider an adult-useable back seat is the Ford Excursion! :P
4245	October 5, 2005 5:37PM	bobw3	"Based on the Ford website for the Excursion, Explorer, Freestyle:

Head Room Row:
1 41.0, 39.8, 39.4
2 41.1, 38.7, 39.8
3 38.2, 37.4, 38.6

Leg Room Row:
1 41, 42.4, 41.1
2 40.8, 36.9, 40.4
3 39, 34.9, 33.3

To get some perspective, here are the length, width, height:
Excursion 226.4 x 79.9 x 77.4
Explorer 193.4 x 73.7 x 72.8
Freestyle 200.1 x 74.9 x 68.2"
4246	October 5, 2005 7:08PM	andre1969	"you have to take those legroom numbers with a grain of salt, although the Explorer does stack up awfully well to the Excursion, at least in published measures. Still, it's funny how actually sitting in the car, large discrepancies can come up. For example, when the stats were first published for the Chrysler LX cars, they listed front legroom at 41.8"", which had me worried. My '00 Intrepid is rated at 42.2"", which is just barely adequate...in fact, I wish the seat would go back further! So if 42.2"" barely cuts it, I figured losing a half-inch off that would be a dealbreaker. But imagine my shock when I sat in one, and it felt like the seat went back a lot further than in my Intrepid! But then the Camry is rated at something like 41.8"", and it feels tight to me.

Sometimes a taller seat will give you more legroom in the way they measure it, but you still might end up being closer to the seatback in front of you. Plus, as you sit higher, your legs will extend outward more horizontally, instead of upward, requiring more room behind the front seatback for your legs.

Is that 39"" measurement for front seat legroom correct for the Freestyle?! I don't think I've seen a measurement that small since your typical early 70's Japanese subcompact! :surprise:"
4247	October 5, 2005 7:27PM	bobw3	I know what you mean about the numbers. Plus for rows 2 & 3, I don't know if those are measured with the seat in front fully forward, or back or where? Maybe you could go to a dealer and go into each of vehicles and let us know for real!
4248	October 5, 2005 7:32PM	andre1969	"to do that sometime. Honestly, I don't think I've been in a Freestyle other than at the auto show, and there they had the power disconnected so I couldn't get the front seat comfy. The only time I sat in an Excursion was when I saw one on a local CarMax lot. I was impressed that I could sit in the middle row and the third row, and not have my knees touch the seatback in front of me. Still, with something that huge, I guess you should expect that! I was actually a bit disappointed up front though. I just figured something that size would have more legroom up front!

And, now that I think about it, I don't think I've tried out all the seating positions of the Explorer. The previous generation used to seem cramped to me, but the new one seems okay up front. I haven't tried out the 3rd row seat though, and can't remember how the middle row was."
4249	October 5, 2005 8:21PM	bobw3	"Freestyle front seat legroom is 41.1 (more than the Excursion). The numbers 1,2,3 indicate the row number, and going across is Excursion, Explorer, Freestyle. I think you were reading it backwards.

Took our kids on a trip from Denver to Vegas in it .. at the time, my stepson was 15 and stepdaughter was 13. He occupied the second row, she took the back row and had one seat folded down in the second row so she could stretch out. Neither kid really complained about space (or the lack thereof) for the 1500 mile round trip.

In fact, when we first looked at the Explorer, we had both our daughter and her best friend sit in the third row and comment on its comfort. At the time, we were driving the previous generation Expedition, and both of them thought it compared well.

The nice thing about the Explorer was that the third row folded into the floor (with the Expedition, you had to physically remove the third row), and the mileage was a bit better (Expedition got about 13-14MPG, while the Explorer got 17-18).

That said, I'm really glad we don't own either of those vehicles anymore .. the kids drive themselves and the wife now drives her VUE AWD V6, which got just over 26MPG on its last tank --- better than the EPA highway number of 25."

My knees are at my chest, a big reason being the Pathfinder, besides having the seat too low, has no way to place your feet under the 2nd seat. The Explorer's 3rd seat is higher and farther back, plus the 2nd row is high with plenty of room to place your feet underneath. The Explorer still pales compared to our 2000 Expy, but it's a much smaller vehicle. And humping that 3rd row bench seat in and out of the previous generation Expy's was a labor of hate."

2006 BMW 325i
It's fun and it has four doors. It has the full gamut of safety features as standard equipment. It's not roomy, it has the same image problem as other BMW's, and there will be heck to pay if I still own it when the warranty runs out, but I think I like it (never love anything that can't love you back)!

I think the Canyon is still in my profile. I borrow it from my parents when I need to haul things. It's notable for its power (uplevel engine in a regular cab, 2wd) and enormous blind spot on the driver's side in the regular cab. It's kind of crude to drive. Longer wheelbase trucks tend to ride better."

Yes she is!! She's 14 months old and just shy of 49k miles. Still the greatest car I've ever owned! Hubby took her to work today since I needed his Dodge so I could do a *grumble* firewood delivery. He hardly ever drives her, so most of those miles are from me. :blush:

To put her miles in perspective, hubby's 99 Ram has 38k on it and my 04 Titan has 20k on it."
4265	October 7, 2005 6:24AM	nippononly	Hey, maybe you should get one of the new R-class models! Saw my first one tonight - a brand new R500 and wow! It is a lot bigger than the pictures led me to believe. Nice look too. I prefer it to the new ML-class. It is bigger than a Pacifica, has to be bigger even than a Chrysler Town and Country. But they got the proportions just right in the styling.
4266	October 7, 2005 9:13AM	boomchek	"What does anyone here own?

2005 Honda Civic LX coupe
1978 Chevy Impala 4 door (when I feel like feeling old and want to listen to AM radio I drive it :P , it's only one year younger than me)"
4267	October 7, 2005 12:24PM	andre1969	"Here's my list, and the justification for them all, no matter how off-the-wall it may be! :shades:

1957 DeSoto Firedome: I got turned on to Forward Look era Mopars by the movie ""Christine"", which came out when I was 13. Soon thereafter I saw a picture of a '57 DeSoto, and fell in love with it. Found one for sale about an hour and a half away, and bought it back in 1990, when I was still in college. Funny, but I was in college, no job, but seemed like I had more money back then!
1968 Dodge Dart 270: I had been driving a '69 Dart GT that was a great all-round car...decent blend of performance/economy with the pre-smog Slant six it had, good interior room up front, huge trunk, reliable. Well, it got totaled, and the next day I found this 270. It was a totally different beast from the GT though, because it had a mildly hopped-up V-8. Much faster, much thirstier, and not nearly as reliable. MUCH higher mileage, though, with around 253,000 miles on it when I bought it, versus around 77,000 on the GT when I totaled it.
1967 Pontiac Catalina convertible: something I always wanted ever since I was a little kid. Saw one at a used car lot, oddly enough, while cruising around after a Mopar show.
2000 Dodge Intrepid: Probably got lured in by the 0.9% financing more than anything else, but at the time it was probably the best car out there that fit my needs. An Accord, Camry, and especially an Altima were too small back then. You probably couldn't have paid me to drive a Taurus. And I didn't like the style/interior/comfort of the Impala.
1979 Chrysler New Yorker 5th Ave: I used to have a '79 Newport that I loved, and, piece of junk that it was, I always missed it after I got rid of it. So when I found this NYer on eBay, I just had to have it
1985 Silverado: Granddad bought it new, and a few years after he died, Grandmom gave it to my Mom. Mom bought a new F-150 a few years back, and passed it down to me.
1976 Pontiac Grand LeMans: something else I've always wanted ever since I was a little kid. I think ""Smokey and the Bandit"" turned me on to these big '76-77 LeManses.

So, some of my automotive choices haven't exactly been logic-based! :P"
4268	October 7, 2005 2:23PM	anonymousposts	"""What does anyone here own?""

2004 Honda Accord EX-L - bought because we needed a mid-size for the baby and the Accord 5-speed manual is the best in the business (disclaimer: IMO).

2003 Civic Si - bought because Gee wanted a commuter with good performance and gas mileage. Has lived up to both of those with close to 40,000 miles on it.

2004 Honda Odyssey - bought because we needed something a little bigger than the Accord for the first few years. It has come in handy and we will miss it when the lease ends in 6 months.

1994 Lexus LS400 - bought because it was a good deal back in 2001 and Gee wanted to get out of his less than perfect 2000 Silverado. Now we keep it around for the basement spiders to have a place to live."

4270	October 7, 2005 2:44PM	mark156	"Nippononly, I haven't seen the new Mercedes R-class yet in person, just photo's. Either they are flying off the lot or they are hiding them somewhere. I just had the ML in for a small warranty issue (4wd button fell inside the dash) at a very large Mercedes dealer (I was out of town). This dealer has about 20 service guys working the service drive. This was one interesting operation to watch as I waited about an hour to have the button reattached.

The contenders to replace the 2002 ML500 if I decide that I want to stay with 6+ passenger seating:

Mercedes R-class (I was really wanting to go with a different brand this next time)
Land Rover LR3
Volvo XC90 SUV
Volvo wagon
Cadillac SRX
Jeep Commander (haven't seen in person yet)
Lexus GX (but, I don't like the big swing-out gate)
Lexus LX470 (long in the tooth looks)
Acura MDX (style changing soon)
Honda Pilot (style changing soon)

If I decide to go with 5 passenger seating, there are a huge number of vehicles to pick from:

BMW X5
BMW X3
Mercedes ML
Mercedes E-wagon
Lexus RX330/400h

I guess part of the fun is looking. :P

4271	October 7, 2005 2:51PM	andre1969	"the garage is coming along pretty quickly now, although it's raining, so I know that's going to slow things down. The crew came out on Wednesday afternoon to start erecting it, and by yesterday afternoon all the framing, roof trusses, and roof sheathing were up.

It's supposed to rain today and tomorrow, and possibly Sunday, so I have a feeling the crew is going to pack up and come back on Monday to try and finish up. So it's getting there! At least it's more than just 18 holes in the ground like it had been for awhile...we were joking that I had a golf course out there!"
4272	October 7, 2005 2:56PM	michaellno	"Saturn VUE AWD V6 - wife likes the visibility of an SUV, refuses to be seen in a minivan (and with the kids driving themselves, it's not all that necessary), plus the ground clearance comes in handy during the winter months. Oh, and did I mention that it comes with the 3.5L Honda V6 with 250HP? Vroom! 13K miles currently.

Ford Focus ZX5 - had a lease on an Explorer; Ford sent us a notice indicating that they would pay off the remainder of the lease if we bought or leased another Ford. Took 4 dealers to find the right car in the right color with the right equipment. Nearly doubled the MPG (from 16 to 30+) and halved the payment (from $580 to $320 per month). Like Jolie, the Focus has done everything we've asked of it and more. Has 32K miles on it.

Saturn L300 V6 - was looking for a 4 door sedan with a V6, leather, sunroof. Like Andre, I was probably swayed more by the deal rather than the car - in this case, 0% for 60 months. Combined with my GM Supplier discount, the Saturn was anywhere from $2000 to $4000 less than anything else I was looking at (Accord, Altima, Passat). Also got 4 wheel disc brakes, ABS, TC, climate control, advanced audio (subwoofer) - essentially, fully loaded for $24K. Has about 43-45K miles on it (don't know exactly, stepdaughter drives it mostly)."
4273	October 7, 2005 3:40PM	fintail	"1998 MB C43 - 55K, in pretty much new condition. Intoxicating exhaust note and speed along with tolerable economy. A very neat little car that makes me look forward to my commute, even the one going to work. Many people think it cost 2 or 3 times what I paid, too.

1964 MB 220 SE - 247K, in very good original condition, that I have had since I was a teenager. It's a late series injected fintail with dual circuit discs, 4 speed auto, etc. It doesn't have many issues for something its age, and the FI makes it very reliable.

I also had a 1989 MB 300SE, 182K, a 6cyl S class, that I had to sell when the C43 came along. It was a beautifully maintained car in the best colors, that always got compliments from MB people. I had a buyer lined up even before I was ready to sell."
4274	October 7, 2005 6:54PM	jaserb	"2004 Mazda MPV. 17k miles. It's the perfect size, looks great, drives well, and was cheap as dirt. It was advertised in the paper at $8k under sticker - roughly $1500 under invoice at the time, even once all the rebates were factored in. On top of that we got an overallowance on our trade in - about $2k over what Terry told me to expect, due in part to the UC appraiser assuming it was 4WD when it wasn't. To their credit, they didn't try to unwind the deal - by the time we figured it out the papers were signed. A screaming deal on the perfect vehicle for us - that doesn't happen too often.

1992 Dodge Ram 50 4x4. 166k miles. Great little beater truck. I bought it for $1500 a little over a year ago with a bad clutch (that I knew about) and a tranny that was about to grenade (that I didn't.) I put in a new clutch and a junkyard tranny in it for about $800 and I've put about 10k miles on it since as my daily driver. Perfect for hauling mountain bikes, mulch, etc. I've thought about replacing it, but I've kind of become attached to the 'lil red beast. The A/C even works!

1974 Alfa Romeo Spider. In lots of pieces in my garage - by Spring I'll have it put together again. Maybe.

-Jason"
4275	October 7, 2005 10:18PM	scanty	"1994 300ZX Convertible, leased new then purchased. 125,000 miles and still looks and runs great. Been tempted to let it go in order to get something newer (S2000, 350Z, G35 Coupe) but I think I'll keep it. Not good CCBA activity, but it's too rare, and too much fun.

1999.5 Pathfinder, bought used (on ebay from a guy in Brooklyn) in 2002. It's a great truck. Nearly bulletproof. Coming up on 100,000 miles and going strong. 16.5 mpg isn't great, but my commute is less than 5 miles each way. If it headed downhill, I'd probably be looking at '01-'04 Pathfinders and QX4's, or maybe a new CR-V."
4276	October 7, 2005 11:46PM	bumpy	"I'll just list everything:

1980 Chevrolet Citation- built in April 1979, V6 automatic, ex-Grandma car. I learned to drive in that old beast in 1993, handed it down to my sister when I went to college, and my brother started to learn to drive it when it popped a seal and dumped out the tranny fluid all over the exhaust around 80k.

1988 Nissan Sentra- bought it in 1995 with 196k on the clock, learned to drive stick in it, changed the oil once in 1996, got it run into a few times, replaced the entire front suspension in stages, popped the head gasket in 2002, and finally called the junkyard to get it in 2003.

1991 Isuzu pickup- bought it in 2000 as a backup for the Sentra. Has the old they-made-them-that-late? carburated 2.3L, heavy springs, and a sagging front bumper that my dad attributed to the previous owner's ""parking by braille"" technique.

2000 Hyundai Accent- bought it to replace the Sentra in 2002. Drives and handles like the Sentra (since Hyundai basically cloned the B12/13 underpinnings). I did put a short-throw shifter in it last year and splurged on some 14"" alloys this summer.

1992 Nissan Sentra SE-R- bought it last year from an ad in the paper, as I was in the mood to scratch a sport compact performance itch. 228k on the clock and it still pulls like it was new.

1966 GMC 1500 pickup- my lawnmower doesn't fit in the Isuzu, so I needed a full-size pickup. I didn't want to deal with the byzantine under-hood setups on newer trucks, liked the styling of the early-60s GM trucks, and wanted something different than a regular old small-block V8; so I bought a longbed 3/4-ton (1/2-ton GMCs were model 1000 in those days) pickup with the uncommon close-ratio NP435 4-speed and a 351 c.i. big-block V6 (the motor weighs close to 900 pounds)."
4277	October 8, 2005 4:01AM	michaellno	"Could I get your opinion on this:

Worth a one-way trip to Chicago?

This is the same engine as your C-class, correct?"
4278	October 8, 2005 4:46AM	fintail	"Well, it's fully loaded, and you don't often see ones so red. It looks pretty nice, and it looks to be just at retail for one in nice shape. It looks to have the AMG package, which is a good dress up item. The car has the moonroof, so it should also have the rain sensing wipers, which I think are cool.

The engine is based on the same as the C43, but the C43 has AMG intake/exhaust/cam/transmission tuning etc. I think it's 30-40 hp up on the normal 4.3. The interior is very similar, I recognize a lot of that car...the steering wheel is even the same design.

It's a fairly solid unit ...only issues I know of on the C43 are some reports of harmonic balancer problems, which MB has quietly had a recall issue with. So if it fails, you aren't completely out of luck. MB claims/lies about these cars having a lifetime transmission that never needs servicing, but the car should have it serviced anyway by 70K miles. I took mine in for a service and the tech guy scoffed and said it was a lifetime unit - I countered by asking if it was then warranteed for life...he then agreed with my idea of servicing it. Just make sure the car has been maintained and has some kind of records, if you are serious about it."
4279	October 8, 2005 5:04AM	akangl	"Had to take the Titan in to have the E-brake adjusted (hubby messed it up back in June.........cost me $40.28), so while I was waiting on it I wandered around the used car lot (big mistake). Found a NICE (did I mention it was NICE??) 2001 Ford F-250 CC SB XLT 4x4 V10, probably the cleanest used truck I've ever seen, the bed hasn't been used, its clean under the truck, the engine, interior, still smells new. Definatly not a truck that's ever seen work. Has about 51,600 miles on it (I'd swear it was more like 5100). Drove GREAT, everything works, no problems found. Dealer is asking $24,995 but the GSM immediatly dropped the price to $21,712. He offered $26k for my truck (trade is $26,600).

Talked it over with hubby and he said to call them back tomorrow and see if they have another $2k or so to play with.......if so then we'll do it. I'm thinking they might just to move the truck (V10 in times of $2.80/gallon gas). Our Dodge V10 averages 9.5 mpg, my Titan averages 13.5 mpg, I think the Ford V10 will fall somewhere between the 2 which is fine with me.

ARGH, I KNOW better than to wander the used car lot with Jeff (my favorite salesguy). Good thing the Titan rarely breaks anything anymore.

Also touched bases with my Ford salesguy in Anchorage, he's got a new 04 diesel that he's willing to take a loser deal on to move it. Said he would call me back Monday evening, when he works next to give me the numbers.

I keep telling myself to wait another year, but everytime I have to overload the Titan I think that I'm better off to cut my losses now and get a bigger truck. This weekend is gonna be rough.........have to do 11 cords of firewood............both the Dodge and Titan must work hard.......along with their owners. :blush:"
4280	October 8, 2005 12:18PM	racer63	"Here we go:

1986 Honda Civic Si. Bought used in 1992 with 97,000 miles on it. Driven as a street and weekend autocross car until 140,000 miles in January 1995, which by then the input shaft bearing had gone bad in the tranny. Taken off the road and reinvented as a race prepared Auto-x car that summer. Now sits as a spare shelf in the garage, but will likely see competition duty again next spring.

2000 Toyota Celica GT Bought new in March 2000, and currently has 91,000 miles. It replaced a '95 Jetta GLX the day the extended warranty ran out on the VW. Not a coincidence. It was bought for a the same purpose the Honda was in '92. Daily drive and weekend fun car, a mission which in hindsight it has filled well. This particualr vintage Celica does have some well-documented weaknesses, but the only one afflicting me has been tranny woes, of which I am on No. 3, fortunately all covered under powertrain warranty. The current one shifts like a charm, with no crunches, whines, or blocked shifts like the first 2. All in all, this car is kind of like a spouse; a few annoying quirks but worthwhile to keep over the long term. I'm in the market to buy something, but this car will likely stick around.

2004 GMC Sierra 2500HD Crew Cab The ultimate family truckster. In spring '04 I had a '99 Exploder V8. a '95 29' Motorhome, and an open car trailer, to do regular family of 4 car and weekend duty. The Exploder was costing $500-1000 to fix semi-regularly on stupid quality related stuff. (Ball Joints, Steering Rack, etc.). The RV was making me nervous on having even more expensive things go wrong with it. And the open car trailer was a PIT* to load and unload. So the household CFO gave me pemission to Sell Everything. After the RV went (for almost what I paid for it 3 years prior!), we bought this truck. Since we didn't need or want a third seat, the pick-up does what we need well, and I don't have to worry about dirtying up the back. Just hose it out. It has a 1-ton chassis and running gear, and even with only the 6.0 gas motor, tows my new 8000lb all loaded up enclosed trailer just fine at 70 mph, getting 9-9.5 mpg, which isn't all that bad. Around town, it gets the same as the Exploder. Oh, and 0% for 60 months. Can't beat free money, though I don't want to know how upside down I probably am 15 months into the deal. My wife daily drives this, and loves being the queen of the soccer fields. This one will stay around a while.

So that leaves me to my next purchase, which currently has me leaning in the direction of am '03-'05 E46 BMW 330i, with the ZHP Performance Package. More hp, higher redline, better suspension, and shorter rear gears. This may be a tugh find, but I like the pre-Bangle cars' looks better. A 2 year old example CPO should be a somewhat reasonable deal too. I plan on having fun looking."
4281	October 8, 2005 4:44PM	woodyww	The V10 is not the Diesel, right? From what you've said about wanting the Diesel, & what I've read about the Ford Diesel, I'd hold out for that. I think it might pay off even if it costs a few thousand more up-front......just one opinion.
4282	October 8, 2005 4:59PM	danf1	Please buy something. We have people posting here who have not bought a car in 3 years. They need someone to set a good example for them.

Has an inclination towards a Prius, & could use the income tax break on that. I like that idea, but she does a lot of highway driving, & I started to think that a 4 cyl. Accord is probably a better, & more ""substantial"", all-around vehicle . Any thoughts? TIA!"
4284	October 8, 2005 5:14PM	stickguy	with the 4 cyl. accord. And if you can still find a leftover '05, quite a good deal can be had.
4285	October 8, 2005 5:15PM	danf1	You can't go wrong with the Accord. She should take a look at the Sonata too. It will keep some money in her pocket, gets good gas mileage (4cyl auto rated at 24 and 33), has all the latest safety equipment and the warranty is always there too.
4286	October 8, 2005 5:15PM	bobw3	What type of stuff and how many passengers do they need/want to carry? Does she drive a lot in the snow/mountains? Need all wheel drive (AWD) maybe? If she's not going to carry a lot of stuff or passengers or need AWD there are a lot of choices in that range. The Prius still gets good hwy mpg, so that would be a good choice.
4287	October 9, 2005 12:50AM	kyfdx	Ditto.... Accord... for a non-car person, why mess around with anything else?

Personally I'm not too into diesels, yeah we might save a little in fuel economy but as frequently as I trade trucks (notice I said *I*) it won't pay off to buy the diesel for me. Hubby will get one when the Dodge needs replacing (yeah like that's going to happen)."

Yes my Titan is a lease and I am upside down in it. However, I'm putting money down to cover the negative equity. So, we will finance the new truck for 48 months (most likely), our payment will go down and we will own the thing a lot sooner than we would the Titan (providing we bought it out at the end of the lease......which is a probably since I'm already at 21k miles in a year). Our total debt would go down by over $10k also.

Its not a bad deal, just have to get the dealer to agree to my terms, will work on that tomorrow since my goofy salesguy forgot to call back.........he forgets my name, forgets to call back, lol, good thing I kinda like him. :P"

4293	October 9, 2005 6:53PM	woodyww	"I'd at least stick to the $$ #'s Terry laid out--it sounds like the Ford truck is worth more like $15K, not $21.7K.....& don't forget the effect gas prices are having on prices of big SUV's (& I assume, trucks). Also, a few weeks ago you loved the Titan so much you couldn't bear to give it up......& the dealer may be dying to get rid of a V10 truck that gets 10 mpg. All I'm suggesting is, pick a low $$# for the F250 ($15-16ish), at least start there, & don't be ""too eager"", the dealer may come down a lot more in a week or 2.....good luck!"

woody: If your friend wants a highway car then the Accord is a great choice. But depending on her preferences she might want to look at a Camry too. Softer ride if she is on that side of the buying spectrum. If not, the Accord is a sportier alternative to the Camry."
4295	October 10, 2005 5:50AM	akangl	"We have been discussing for a long time, parking the Titan was mainly due to $$$ at the time, however, that's over with.

I owe way too much on the Titan (am embarrassed to say, lol), but when it comes down to it I'm about $7k in the hole. I love my truck, but don't want to kill it making it do a bigger truck's job. I'm tossing around the idea of buying an older 1-ton and keeping the Titan.

I'm going to lowball the dealer tomorrow and see where it gets me, for $1k more than he's asking I can get a newer diesel at the lot across the road from them (just did a car.com search).

Now another kink in this whole thing is my son is on a *I want a pony* kick. I've located the pony I want to buy him, but its either trade my truck or buy the pony. This kid never asks for anything and he works his butt off.........he's 11 and yesterday was out in the woods with us, he had to split up 5 cords of wood (with our hydralic splitter which isn't all that easy). He's a great kid and I'm inclined to give in this time.

4296	October 10, 2005 1:41PM	woodyww	I've gotta think a Diesel (Ford?) is gonna have way better resale value--& save you fuel $$ in the meantime. And just imagine if gas goes to $4-$5.......people may be practically giving away huge gas-engine trucks, as in 1973-74.

So I ask again what the numbers are on the truck, he then says ""well, we don't have time for this right now, we have a sales meeting"" My reply was ""huh??"" He then says ""you'll either have to wait or call me later"" He tries to hand me his card, I leave it on the desk and get up. He then says ""aren't you going to take my card?"" I said no, if you don't have time now then there's other dealerships in Alaska where I can buy a truck. He got pissed and said something (I was walking away), I then hear him yell ""BYE"" and walk off.

2004 Mazda 6S 5Door
2005 Explorer XLT V8
BUT- my wife took the Mazda in for oil change today, saw a new Miata, knew I had been sniffing around for used ones a few weeks back (dreaming, really), and says ""Would you like one for your 50th birthday?"" She is coming into some cash. I think I should have one, as after age 50 I could ""go"" at any moment! To be fair, if she hold's this offer I'll shop for a used one. Then she can also take me on a nice vacation this winter. Whuddaya think?"

4304	October 14, 2005 4:10PM	woodyww	Oh man, I like this idea a lot! I'd try to get a recent used one tho that has a lot of the newer upgrades (my Miata knowledge of all the years/options/versions is not complete). Altho I just noticed you can buy a new one for what, $23-26K? And there's a redesign due for '06 models........

Thanks for showing a small peek of your Pontiac convertible! You have a nice looking property.... you should fill it with cars! Are you looking for a slightly used white Titan by chance? LOL

I've never seen a garage built before the concrete work was done. I guess in other parts of the country things are done differently.

New Civic, Fusion, and now the Lexus IS250, all had something I would have to rationalize away or talk myself into. I do like the BMW 325, so I guess the only thing there to talk myself into is the $$ and the potential reliability!

Maybe I'm just getting too picky in my old age, or (**shudder**) I don't really want to buy a new car (said by the guy with (2) 2005's in the garage).

Actually, Mr. SHifty has been touting older (1991-1995) Audi S4s. I scoped them out on Ebay, and darn that is a neat car, not that I would ever find a good one near me for a decent price.

Oh well, I shall keep looking!"

My friends laugh at me because I use my cruise control ALL of the time. One of the main streets near my house has a 40 mph speed limit. Because it's a 6 lane street with a turning lane in the middle, people will travel at 50 mph most of the time. I see cars getting tickets quite often.

All I do is flip on the cruise and sit back. I haven't had a speeding ticket since 1985. Got a warning in Texas in 1996 doing 70 in a 65. The cop was in a Mustang police car and just wanted to stop me and my buddy just to see what we were doing and where we were going. I had rented a 1996 Lincoln Town Car, white, and was driving just slightly over the speed limit. My radar detector went off and I hit the cancel on the cruise.... he stopped me anyway.

The cop separated us to see if our stories were matching; I sat in the front seat of the Mustang cop car and my friend was in the front passenger seat in the rental. We were driving to California to check on an investment property and thought a drive would be fun. I don't use a radar detector anymore, the speed limit works for me.

4312	October 15, 2005 5:08PM	woodyww	If you don't mind my asking, what is this garage costing you? And, are you building it yourself, or using a contractor, etc.?
4313	October 15, 2005 6:42PM	akangl	"Akangl, I read on another thread that you were looking at GMC truck, are you still considering it? You mentioned that it had been wrecked so I guess the price would reflect that.

Nope, they said the truck had never been wrecked, yeah right, even hubby spotted the new parts. The front fenders had definatly been off, it had new wheel well linings, new paint on the front clip, new headlights, grille, and a new bumper.

They offered $22k for the Titan but would not budge off the $19,995 for the GMC. So basically they wanted to give me the GMC and $2k for my Titan...........uh no. The GMC had a trade in of $18k (loan value is $16k), the Titan has a trade in of $26k (loan value of $23,5), so I was thinking more along the lines of $22k for my truck and $16k for thier truck..........in other words they give me the GMC and $6k for my truck. I think I was being generous considering that GMC truely has no value being wrecked and canadian.

Ah well, they can keep it, I'll keep plugging along with the Titan (at least I know its American and hasn't been wrecked). I can concievably buy out the lease in the spring if I want to, but am going to wait to see what the used car market does, I may just buy a beater truck and park the Titan after our vacation until the miles are in line, then turn it in at the end of the lease. We are already at 21k miles, only allowed 48k through the whole lease."
4314	October 15, 2005 9:02PM	andre1969	"Woodyww, here's a rough breakdown of what this garage has cost me so far...

$15,000: what the pole barn company gets, includes materials, labor, drilling the holes, etc. I'm not doing it myself, but after watching the crew put it up, it really doesn't look like it would've been that hard to do. Still, I can get impatient and frustrated, so it was probably best to just pay to have it done. They came out on Wednesday afternoon, the 7th, worked all day the 8th, morning on the 9th,came back in the afternoon on Columbus day, and were finished the day after around 5:00
$800: 2 dumptruck loads of gravel
$233: the permit to build the thing
$50: a bribe fee I had to pay to the county to get a ""tree conservation"" letter, which basically gives me permission to cut down trees on my own property. Nevermind the fact that neither I, nor my ancestors, had to get permission to let the things grow up in the first place! :mad:
$600: to have an engineer come out and draw up a new plan and certify it when the footer holes filled up with groundwater and the building inspector failed it.
$1300: for the concrete that's already been poured in the footer holes, plus the work that the guy doing the grading and such has done so far.

So, as it sits right now, it's just a shade under $18,000. I'm guessing it'll be another $4000 or so to finish up with the grading/filling, slab, and gravel driveway. So once it's all said and done, I'm guessing it'll run maybe $22-23K. Naturally, it ended up running more than I thought it would (don't most home projects? :blush: ) And I haven't even thought about electricity yet...I'll cross that bridge when I get to it! Plus, if the need arises, I have enough extension cords to reach out to the garage. It's about 150 feet from the house.

The main thing I wanted, for the time being at least, is something to keep my cars out of the weather. I have my '57 DeSoto and '76 LeMans crammed in my grandmother's garage. My '67 Catalina convertible is sitting under a 10x20 car canopy. And my '79 NYer is currently in the shop, but normally just sits out in the yard. So, once all these are garaged, I guess I have to go buy something to fill up my grandmother's garage, plus a few new yard ornaments! :P"
4315	October 16, 2005 4:26PM	woodyww	"Sounds like a lot of garage for the $$--what are the dimensions? And is it any more difficult to add electricity after the fact? You'll probably need it, in case you want to go out & futz around with your cars at night.....at least I would. And get plenty of outlets all over, plus at least one outside light. Then there's are the cool wall-storage systems you can get now. (I have garage-envy).

cheers, woody"
4316	October 16, 2005 5:41PM	andre1969	"it's 24x40 feet overall (not counting the T-111 siding). One the inside, it ends up being 22'10"" x 39'2"" inside the 4x6 poles. It uses pole barn construction, versus the regular type of framing that the typical garage or house uses, and is supposed to be cheaper than frame construction.

I never did price a frame building, though, so I don't have anything to go by as a reference. Back in 2003 my Mom and stepdad had a 24x28 garage built and it ended up costing around $19,000 for everything. That included a brick front, vinyl siding, electricity, nicer windows (mine are kinda trailer park-ish, although they look like they're actually double-pane) and a 9 foot interior height...I think mine will come in at a bit over 8 feet once the slab's poured.

But then, my Mom is in a different county, and their garage was built by Mennonites or Amish or some similar group that tends to charge a lower labor rate. And I'm sure labor rates and construction materials have gone up since 2003, especially with the housing boom and such. I've heard that concrete in particular has really skyrocketed.

Still, I'm happy with it. Originally I was going to go with a 30x40 gambrel barn with a loft, but the county shot that one down real fast. They have a silly little restriction here that no secondary buildings can have more square footage than the primary structure. This 30x40 building would've had 1200 square feet (thy didn't count the loft) but they only had my house down as having 1106 square feet. It's actually more like 1500, but they don't count my enclosed side porch, and they consider it a 1 1/2 story, so they only count half of the upstairs square footage.

They also had a height restriction of 15 feet for any secondary buildings. However, on cape cod style buildings, they took the measurement half way up the roof. On gambrel style buildings, they'd take the measurement where the steeper plane of the roof meets the flatter plane, which on my original plan came in at 17 feet. So back to the drawing board I went!

Annoyingly enough, the second time I went in to apply for the permit, using the plans for the building I have now, they told me that they changed the way they measure height. Turns out too many people were building cape cods and then bumping the upstairs out with massive dormers, in effect making a complete second story. So they just gave up and decided to change the height cap to 20 feet. By that time though, I was fed up enough that I wasn't about to go and get a THIRD design drawn up! :mad:

I don't think electricity will be too hard to do after the fact, because the inside of the garage is just a shell, so it's not like there's any drywall to tear out or anything. The worst part would probably be having to dig a trench from the house all the way down to the garage to run the electric. But then, there's a utility pole about 90 feet from the garage, out at the street, so it may be worth it to just run a separate meter/circuit breaker box and just not have it tie into the house at all."

Had a close call last week though. Was running about 90 in a 55 behind a ""rabbit"" Cavalier. Guy in the Cav was trying to keep me from ""passing"" him. Like i was really gonna pass him going that fast. He turns off at a intersection and about a quarter mile later I get pulled over. Cop couldn't give me a ticket because he hadn't actually clocked my car but the Cav. Told me to slow down. Too late. I already had done that. Rule one of speeding is to never do it alone."

I found out a long time ago that possessions expand to fill or exceed the space available... How many people do you know that can't park in their garage because they're using it for storage? How many of these people move into a bigger house, often double the size of the old one, and still can't park in their garage? One of the biggest changes in my hometown since I graduated high school is the proliferation of self-storage facilities..."
4322	October 17, 2005 2:04PM	woodyww	"I shelled out $400 for a Valentine 1 a couple of years ago. It's supposed to be the best, & works great. Sounds expensive unless you've gotten a few $200-$400 tickets before. Still, driving 85 or 90 in a 55 or 65 is not totally foolproof, esp. if the detector ""lulls"" you into more aggressive driving."
4323	October 17, 2005 2:09PM	andre1969	"having moved from a 1250 square foot condo to a 1500 square foot house, I sure found a way to fill it fast! One problem though, was that the condo had plenty of attic space and a 1 car garage. The house has a very low, flat roof, and while there is attic space, I don't use it because it's too hard to get up in there. Still, it's amazing how fast the house got filled. Oh almost forgot...I did get another roommate, a dog, and another cat, so that accounts for part of the additional clutter!

In addition to the 24x40 garage I'm building though, there are two other buildings on the property. One of them is about 10x20, and used to be a garage back in the old days. It needs a lot of work though, and I'm torn right now between trying to fix it up, or just tear it down. There's also a 12x16 building with a tin roof and sides that's still structurally sound, but does need to be re-roofed and animal proofed. Both of these buildings are pretty full of stuff that many generations of my ancestors have been collecting and hoarding over the decades, and a lot of it is probably worthless by now.

I am thinking about building a small room off the back of the tin building, maybe bumping it out to 12x24 or 12x30 or something, and then doing a lean-to on the side for a carport. I'm going to try hard to keep the junk and clutter out of the new garage, but we'll see how long that lasts! :blush:"
4324	October 17, 2005 2:28PM	hammen2	"We all need to get radar detectors! Although, I've never used one regularly, so I'm not sure how much it would help.

You need to find out what bands your local polizei use. If it's laser, you are pretty much hosed - all any detector will do against laser is announce to you, before the officer puts his lights on, that you're going to get a ticket :-(

I second the recommendation for the V1 - I picked one up when they first came out back in 1992, when my job required me to drive 40k+ miles/year all over Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. The V1 saved my butt and my sanity (you try driving through southwestern Minnnesota at 1 a.m. after an 18 hour day, just wanting to get home, and try to stay sane - or drive the speed limit). I still have it but I don't use it (even though the GTO is somewhat stealthy/anonymous, I prefer to be a ""follower"" rather than a ""leader"", if possible).

4325	October 17, 2005 3:30PM	fintail	"That bugs me to no end, seeing perfectly good garages going to waste. People do have too much crap. They need to learn the meaning of either ""garage sale"" or ""Goodwill"", especially as most of the stuff is of no real value, and they'll pay more to store it than it is worth.

It won't happen to me though...I live in a little apartment, and I am not going to be a horrible packrat like my parents. My mother still has 6000 sq ft of clutter in a 2000 sq ft house, and that's after 5 years in an antique mall and several garage sales. A covered car is worth more to me. Sometimes I like to think about what I'd have with a bigger garage. Another fintail? Some other Mercedes? Maybe an older car?"
4326	October 17, 2005 3:38PM	andre1969	"when I lived in my condo, there were 8 units in our little court, each with a 1-car garage. Here's a rundown of what they were used for...

Me: storage either for my Catalina or DeSoto. I used to rotate them between my garage and my grandmother's. Plus, I had a few boxes and shelves packed into the side
Neighbor #1: pool table and storage
Neighbor #2: storage
Neighbor #3: stored an '88 or so Cavalier in there that I swear I never saw move
Neighbor #4: storage, motorcycle, motorcycle trailer
Neighbor #5: storage
Neighbor #6: parked his car in the garage
Neighbor #7: stored a pop-up trailer and a bunch of other stuff packed in there.

So out of these 8 garages, only three people used them for cars. And then, only one used it for the car he drove every day, versus storing a car for a longer term."
4327	October 17, 2005 4:39PM	akangl	"I know I've bounced back and forth on this, I'm so undecided as to the fate of my beloved truck. I really do love the darn thing, but we could do so much more if we had a 3/4 ton or 1 ton. We still have 30 cords of firewood to deliver (have to go get it first). Did 6 cords yesterday, but could only bring out 5, very frustrating!

We are going to the Nissan dealer (again) and hubby is going to look over that 01 F-250 V10. I figure if he's there they will stand up and take notice...........he's never with me, usually I do the numbers and he comes in and signs. If he's there they know they could have a deal that day. I pulled a carfax on the truck and its a 1 owner truck, nothing hinky about it.........unlike the GMC I was looking at.

My Titan is averaging between 12 and 14 mpg, I figure that V10 won't be much worse, our V10 averages between 8-10 mpg (but that's loaded all the time).

Decisions, Decisions.

BTW, We've had Zippy for nearly 15 months, the Dodge for just shy of 2 years, and the Titan for just shy of a year (will be a year for the Titan and 2 years for the Dodge on Nov 12th)."

I'm not a big fan of diesels, we've had 2 and the fuel economy (doing what we do with them) wasn't that much better (maybe 1-2 mpg) than our V10. However, having heavy equipment there are some advantages to having a diesel truck.

We'll see, I'm not too worried either way. Keep in mind its all a write off for the business."

Tom in Virginia"
4331	October 17, 2005 6:54PM	michaellno	"Over the weekend, I was perusing the on-line ads and found what might be a good car for the daughter.

2002 Chevy Malibu LS, 55K, 3.1L V6, power everything, ABS, keyless remote, alloy wheels. Dark grey with grey cloth interior. Asking $9400.

So, today at lunch I stopped by the dealer to take a closer look. Body looks straight, but the front tires were BF Goodrich (fairly new) and the rears were Goodyears (pretty worn).

Car drove pretty nicely ... no major body issues, A/C blew cold, no sqeaks or rattles anywhere, everything seemed to work fine. Edmunds TMV, Kelley Blue Book and Intellichoice all price the car around what the dealer is asking. Told the salesman about what I was looking for (car for daughter, can't drive a stick, would be trading in the Focus).

He, of course, thinks that we can do a deal ... I'm hoping to keep the payments around 300/mo for 36 months. Research on the Focus pegs the trade in value between $7300 and $7900 .. I owe something like $9K, so we'd have to figure out how to deal with that.

We did take a look in the owners manual and it says that the transmission fluid is to be changed at 50K; at 60K, the only issue above LOF and tire rotation is to check the accessory drive belt (?). I would want the tire situation addressed and the transmission service done before going any further.

Of course, all of this is contingent on getting the buy in from both Mrs. Michaell and the daughter.

(NOTE: I washed the Saturn over the weekend and noticed that it only has 42.5K on it, which means that the daughter has put only 2000 miles on the car in the last 4 months - with the Chevy at 55K, I figure she'll put - maybe - 20-25K on the car in the next three years at most, and that's if she goes to college at her first choice, which is about an 80 mile drive from where we live.)

I mentioned the Malibu to the wife briefly over the weekend and her first comment was that the daughter didn't want a Malibu. Perhaps she might reconsider?"
4332	October 17, 2005 7:06PM	stickguy	"give her a choice: the malibu, the stick shift Focus, or whatever she wants to buy with her own money!

Wonder what she picks???"
4333	October 17, 2005 7:11PM	volvodan1	Where I am at in the midwest you can get a 2004 Malibu Classic with 25-30K on it for $10,400 -10,900. I believe all Classics have the equipment you mention. Check it out.
4334	October 17, 2005 7:19PM	andre1969	"because a lot of those ex-rental ""Classics"" only have the 2.2 Ecotech in them, and not a V-6!"
4335	October 17, 2005 7:20PM	michaellno	"There are similar deals here in Denver on '04 Malibus ... the issue I am having is finding a car with ABS. Another dealer is offering '04 Aleros for about $9500 or so. 2.2L 4-banger with automatic, power stuff, keyless remote and alloy wheels. Again, no ABS available.

stickguy - as much as I'd like to ""stick"" her with the Focus (pun intended), I don't really have a huge problem driving it for the time being. It's just that I miss the power of the 24 valve V6, even though it means a bigger fuel bill. It cost me $28 to fill the Focus this morning - just a touch over 32MPG."
4336	October 17, 2005 7:25PM	volvodan1	I understand the ABS thing, but I think in Classics the last 2-3 years the only engine was the 3.1.
4337	October 17, 2005 7:29PM	guss	"I think you can do better than $9400.

About a year ago I bought an 2003 Malibu with 15k miles on it for my mother in law. She paid $9,900 for it. It was an ex-rental, but was in excellent shape. My mechanic said all it needed was brakes and the dealer put them on.

She has not had any problems with it. Thank goodness because she would let me hear about it."
4338	October 17, 2005 8:47PM	corvette	My great-aunt traded her 1995 Cutlass for a 2001 Malibu when my dad was working for a Pontiac dealership in 2001-02. She had a couple of CEL issues, was involved in a couple of fender benders in it, and traded it for a 2004 Century this year.
4339	October 17, 2005 9:25PM	michaellno	"Nope, a lot of the '04 Classics for sale in and around Denver offer the 2.2L 4-cylinder engine.

And, in my research, I found I was wrong on the HP .. for 2002, the 3.1L V6 offered 170HP, not the 155 that I thought. So, not much less than the 182HP I have in the L300 .. the only difference is that the Saturn's engine is an overhead cam, while the Malibu is an overhead valve -- very noticable when you step on the throttle. At least, to me it's noticable.

Mentioned the Malibu to my wife, who says I have to talk to daughter. Will do that tonight after she gets off work ... perhaps I can convince her to come to dealership tomorrow and take a closer look (she's on fall break from HS this week and is not working tomorrow).

I think my biggest concern now is getting the most for the trade in of the Focus ... I can get the $$ to cover the difference (split between us and kid), but the smaller that number is, the better. The salesman wanted me to have the Focus appraised today while I was at the dealer, but I begged off until I had the chance to talk to the family about it.

Insurance actually works out in our favor ... daughter would save $22/month on her insurance payment, according to State Farm."
4340	October 18, 2005 12:47PM	gsemike	Around here in NY, I see those Malibus real cheap. Now that 2006 is upon us, won't that same money get you into a 2002 4 cyl Accord or Camry? I haven't shopped for a Malibu lately, but isn't $7,500 about right?
4341	October 18, 2005 12:52PM	andre1969	"Michaell, I'm not sure, but I think the 3.1 in the '97-99 Malibu had 155 hp, and it was bumped to 170 hp for 2000. The '97-99 actually had a 2.4 DOHC inline 4 standard, with 150 hp. It was basically a watered-down, but more reliable version of the Olds Quad 4.

I had a 2001 Malibu rental a few years back. Its 3.1 was decent around town, and acceleration for merging onto a highway was okay, but highway passing was poor. It just seemed to get winded once you got up around 70-75 mph.

Even though the L-series 3.0 only has 182 hp, I'm guessing it has a much better torque/power curve. I think I've seen 0-60 times of around 7 seconds for the L-series V-6, versus a more mundane 8.8 or so for the Malibu 3.1."
4342	October 18, 2005 4:05PM	gsemike	"My bad on the pricing. I did a quick search on Auto Trader and that seems like a good price. One buick dealer with notoriously high prices on his used cars actually had a few low mileage examples for $13,995. By the end of the run for that car, I don't think that you could go over $15,000 loaded for a new one so why would you go that high for a used one?

The prices on used Accords are astronomical. V6 2002 models are close to 20 large. I know that these cars are in demand but if you figure it was about 25k new, it should have lost more than 20% of it's value in almost 4 years."
4343	October 18, 2005 4:52PM	michaellno	"The wife and I talked about it more last night ... basically, it comes down to trading in a 2003 MY car with 32K miles for a 2002 MY car with 55K miles and paying more for it doesn't seem like a smart move. The wife would rather go the new car route if we did anything.

So, it looks like I'll be driving the Focus for a while longer ... however, when the Saturn Sky is released next year, perhaps the Focus might go at that time!

But, I also have to say that I've been admiring the Ford Fusion lately ... perhaps a loaded SEL 4-cylinder with a stick shift might work."
4344	October 18, 2005 5:10PM	gsemike	"I saw my first couple of Fusions on the road and was disappointed. I don't think that it looks as good in person as it does in pictures. Particularly on the front, it had some unusually large gaps under the grille and in the bezels on the bumper where the optional fog lights would go. Maybe it would look better with the foggies.

I had thught that it could be a contender for my next car but now I don't know."
4345	October 18, 2005 6:44PM	michaellno	"I haven't yet seen a Fusion other than in pictures, but have done a little research on line to see what the dealers are carrying.

I'm seeing more than a few 5-speeds, both in the SE and SEL trim levels. The V6's seem to lean more towards the SE trim. Most of the cars are coming with ABS, which I like.

4-cylinders are running around $20-21K; most of the SE trim level V6's are going for $22-23K, with a few loaded models in the $25-26K range."
4346	October 18, 2005 7:09PM	gsemike	"20-21k for a four banger?? They're going to have to do better than that. 4 cyl Accords, Camrys and Altimas can be had all day long for $17-18k. Since the car is based on the 6, it's not really all new and is probably on the smaller side for the class. They've got to get that car in the teens if it's going to be competitive.

I looked on ford's website and every pic of the Fusion includes the fog lights."
4347	October 18, 2005 7:12PM	asafonov	"Another dealer is offering '04 Aleros for about $9500 or so. 2.2L 4-banger with automatic, power stuff, keyless remote and alloy wheels.

Didn't the Aleros have pretty dismal crash scores?"
4348	October 18, 2005 7:19PM	andre1969	was around $24,000. It had a sunroof, alloys, V-6, automatic, pretty nicely equipped, but it did have a cloth interior. Not sure of the trim level.
4349	October 18, 2005 7:22PM	stickguy	"you can get it nicely equipped in the teens, comparable to the CamCord. And remember, that is sticker. Even the big 2 are MSRP a lot higher than they are retailing for.

It is based on the 6, but an expanded platform. It is actually very roomy, at least as big and comfy as the 2 unmentionables."

I agree completely. At anything over 16K + ttl, it's a financial bath waiting to happen."
4351	October 18, 2005 7:29PM	stickguy	on an Accord, not for a loaded one (EX, EX-L) that sticker for 23k- 24.7K for a 4 cyl 5 speed. Not sure about Camrys, but I never looked to close since I would never consider owning one.
4352	October 18, 2005 7:35PM	gsemike	"on the Accord is not loaded. That's the basic 4 cyl A/T with AC, windows, locks and single CD. I have seen loaded 4 cyl models sticker for 25ish with leather, moonroof, the works. Why anyone would go that high for a 4 cyl model is beyond me.

As long as the Fusion offers that same basic version in the teens it should be a contender. After the so so showing of the 500, Ford needs this model to make some noise. While the 500 is pretty blah, there's something about the look of the montego that I think is pretty snazzy. I recognize that they're practically identical except for the grill but the merc just looks way better to me."
4353	October 18, 2005 8:45PM	michaellno	"Just for giggles and grins, I did a quick search of the inventory at the closest Honda dealer for 2006 Accords .. found the following:

EX with auto -- $23,800
EX with stick -- $23,000
EX-L with auto -- $25,500.

These are for 4-cylinder cars! I paid $24,200 3 years ago for my Saturn L300 with the V6, leather, sunroof, ABS/TC, alloys ... basically, a loaded car.

The closest Ford dealer to my office has 3 Fusions:

SEL with stick (4-cyl) -- $21,045 ($20.045 after rebates)
SE V6 with auto -- $22,360 ($21,360 after rebates)
SEL V6 with auto + leather -- $25,650 (24,650 after rebates)

So ... lessee here ... $25K will get me either a 166HP 4-cylinder Accord with a 5-speed automatic or a 220HP V6 Fusion with a 6-speed automatic. The only significant difference in equipment is the lack of a sunroof on the Fusion (an extra $895, IIRC)."
4354	October 18, 2005 8:47PM	corvette	"Why anyone would go that high for a 4 cyl model is beyond me.

There is a market for well-equipped cars that get good fuel economy, especially with the current price of gas."
4355	October 18, 2005 9:03PM	michaellno	"Agreed, but the MPG numbers for the Accord 4-cylinder with automatic are 24 city and 34 hwy, while the Fusion V6 is rated at 21 city, 29 hwy.

(For comparison's sake, the Fusion 4-cyl with auto has an EPA rating of 24/32, while the Accord V6 auto gets 20/29)

Now, I'm not dissing on the Accord -- I've owned three of them in the past (an '85 LX hatchback, a '92 LX sedan and a '93 DX sedan) -- but I've come to believe that Honda isn't the be-all, end-all when it comes to cars. It seems as if Honda is fairly arrogant in their pricing -- sort of BMW-like, in a way.

The exterior design, over the years, has fluctuated wildly, but that's more of a personal issue than anything else. The interior design is about as ergonomically perfect as can be, but I guess I'd also describe it as .... dull. The Fusion, OTOH, looks pretty good to me, both inside and out (at least, based on the pictures I've seen). While Ford is probably not quite at Honda levels of interior quality, it's pretty close.

Anyway, as my lovely bride says, ""that's why they make chocolate and vanilla ice cream"" ... so's you have a choice. Some folks wouldn't touch the Ford with a 10 foot poll; others wouldn't be caught dead in the Honda, for whatever reason."
4356	October 18, 2005 10:27PM	trucker50	Anybody know how the 500 and Fusion stack up against each other in interior room?
4357	October 18, 2005 11:51PM	godeacs	"Wow! I wouldn't buy from that Honda dealer. Here in Texas you can get 2006 Accords for the following (w/o haggling, a ""1 price"" dealer):

2006 EX - $21940
2006 EX-L - $23436
2006 EX-V6 - $24995

Can imagine you could go lower if you have some decent negotiating skills at other Honda dealers.

Fusion's a 1st year model and we all know what that could mean; unlikely to match Honda's reliability, safety, etc. A ""no brainer"" and I've looked at both of them."

Well, you are close (I'm impressed). We are selling our 18' car hauler trailer, BUT, we purchased a 12' 14k lb GVWR dump trailer. That way, we load it, pull up to someone's house, get out and push a button.......*POOF* its unloaded. We've been wanting to get one for a long time, but there wasn't a heavy duty enough one out.

Yesterday we stopped by our favorite trailer dealer and the owner came out of her office and told us about the new trailers she just got in. We thought about it overnight and went back today to buy it. Dern thing weighs 3820 lbs by itself, our 18' car hauler trailer only weighs 2600 lbs empty.

I'll pick it up on Thursday with the Titan, plus I am taking our 18' trailer up to be put on consignment at the trailer dealer. She said it should sell quickly and we should see an easy $3k for it. Not too bad considering its 2 years old and we paid $4195 for it.........it don't owe us anything, its hauled enough firewood to pay for itself 2 or 3 times over."
4364	October 19, 2005 9:05PM	michaellno	"OK, so I'm not getting a ""new"" used car for the daughter to replace the Focus. Perhaps I should just think about trading in the Focus for a ""new"" new car for Dad.

Which is why I was at the Ford dealer at lunch today test driving a Fusion SE V6. It was dark red with the camel cloth interior. ABS was included, sticker price was just a tick over $22K.

First impression - it is a really handsome car. The pictures I've seen don't seem to do it justice. The aggressive grille, especially. The lines are just right and it is well proportioned. Larger than I would have thought, since it is based on the Mazda 6. The trunk is absolutely huge.

Interior was a mixed bag. While lots of nice materials were used, there were many conflicting colors to be found. Upper dash and door panels were one color, lower dash and center console area another color, mixed with black touches (steering wheel and audio/AC controls) made it look, well, odd to me. While I thought I would be attracted to the camel interior, it was too bright, almost gold colored. Instrumentation was nice, and the multi-function steering wheel is a welcome sight, though I would prefer it to be leather wrapped.

The test drive was fairly short and included only city streets, but the engine and transmission seem to work well together. Suspension handled the broken pavement nicely. Superb turning radius, for what it's worth.

Told salesman to give me a call when an SEL, 5-speed 4-cylinder hits the lots so that I can drive one in comparison. 17"" wheels, coupled with a slightly nicer interior layout might be my cup of tea. Would also like to drive one with a sunroof to see if I fit."
4365	October 20, 2005 2:35PM	corvette	"I kind of like two-tone interiors. I would love to have beige leather(ette) with black carpet, so that the carpet doesn't get stained. In the meantime, I have ""solar collector"" solid black.

I absolutely hate two-tone exteriors, though. One of my friends had a Tahoe that was navy with this hideous gold stripe at the bottom. I liked the special-edition RX300 that was solid red, but not the standard models. The loaded Kia Sportage and Sorento (EX?) would look so much better without the two-tone paint, though I don't think that would get me to buy one!"
4366	October 20, 2005 3:27PM	michaellno	"It's not like I have anything against two (or more) colors in the interior .. or the exterior, for that matter.

I owned an '88 Isuzu Trooper that was white on top and gold on the bottom, separated by a red pinstripe. Medium brown cloth interior ... it was pretty good looking.

I guess my issue with the Fusion was that the tone of the colors inside didn't seem to complement one another very nicely. My opinion, of course, but the SEL interior is one color, so it might appeal to me more.

OTOH, I just might say ""fark it"" and get a Scion xA for the kid. $14K vs. $21K is appealing from a financial point of view."
4367	October 20, 2005 3:36PM	gee35coupe	"That's how I feel about my ""spider condo"".

I mean even if I don't drive it, I do still like looking at it. It's paid for. And it still runs. It does need a major tune up though. I need to get it into the shop. But everything else costs more than $30K. Is it worth it to pay that much for a car when you don't really HAVE to. I can satisfy my CCB when the minivan goes back in 6 months with some cheaper used car.

I'm going to the Taste of Lexus this weekend. That'll be the decision maker for me. If the IS doesn't ring my bell, I'm gonna get the LS serviced and start driving it at least twice a week. A one time $1000 service beats a $500/month car note."

4372	October 21, 2005 2:52AM	akangl	"Things didn't exactly go as planned today. I took the 18' trailer in with me so I could drop it off at the trailer dealer on consignment. Hubby ended up taking the day off from work and coming into town. I met him at the trailer dealer and we dropped the 18' trailer off of my truck, he took the slide in, and they hooked up the new trailer to his truck.

I was filling out consignment paperwork and walked back outside to get some info off of our 18' trailer when hubby looked at me, looked at the trailer, looked back at me, we both shook our heads. We went back inside, bought another slide in and ball, hooked the 18' trailer back up to my truck and I brought it home.

Needless to say it will be staying, don't know what we will use it for (maybe a spider condo), but it will come in handy at times I'm sure. Its paid for, owes us nothing (has delivered more than enough firewood), and is a great trailer. Plus we can't replace it for what it would have been sold for (about $3500), new they are running around $5195 (a full $1k more than we paid for it 2 years ago).

The tally is now 3 vehicles and 4 trailers..........I think we can stop now! :shades:"

We looked at each other because we were both thinking the same thing.......""don't sell the trailer!!"". I'm glad we didn't, it will come in handy at times.

Zippy ain't gonna pull nothing, heck, she's gonna think she died and went to car heaven......only a 52 mile round trip commute now. Still a great car at 50k miles and 15 months old.

We don't *really* need another vehicle, the Titan is doing fine, seems like the harder I push the truck the less problems we have. Well, we'll see about that when it has to pull 9k+ next weekend.........poor truck!

As for the amount of trailers we have.......no, we don't collect them, they all have their purpose. We have an old (73 F100) pickup bed trailer which hubby drags with him to get firewood. We have the 18' trailer which will come in handy at times. We have the new 12' dump trailer (read: save the back during unloading) which hubby will probably pull for the most part in place of the old pickup bed trailer. Then we have the travel trailer (yard ornament for the winter).

Now the fun part.........we thought we were soooo smart buying that dump trailer, but the first day with it wasn't exactly a picnic. By the time hubby got to the logging road he had lost turn signals and brake lights on his truck, he went ahead and took the trailer in to the landing, loaded it, and headed out to make the delivery. He gets to the customer's house and hits the button to dump the trailer, it goes up fine, but he sees something near the hydralic pump.......bends over and about passes out from the smell of burning wires. The trailer melted its wiring. Got it dumped and back down, then came home.

I took the trailer back to the dealer today, they found the problems (factory forgot to put the ground wire on), and rewired the trailer. The owner told us if we have ANY more problems she will replace the trailer with a new one. She did call the bank to see what was involved (a bunch of paperwork) and decided to have her guys fix it, then go from there. So far so good, it didn't blow any fuses on the Titan so I think its ok. :shades:"

Here's a link to a bunch of pics of my '76 LeMans. It's a scattering of pics taken by both the seller and me

Here's a a few pics of my '68 Dart, as it currently sits. It has about 338,000 miles on it and won't start. Common sense is telling me to get rid of it, either by selling it, parting it out, or putting it out of its misery and sending it to the junkyard. But with me, common sense and cars don't always go hand in hand! :blush:

Here's a pic of my '67 Catalina, taken at a local cruise-in back in April. Here's another pic that my Grandma snapped of it, back around 1998, with my old Gran Fury, Newport, Monte Carlo, and Dart in the background. And here's a shot with the top up, which I think was taken about a year later, since my '00 Intrepid is in the background.

Thanks for sharing. Mark"
4393	October 23, 2005 1:04AM	andre1969	"jjtj, I'm not sure what Chrysler called that leather in the New Yorker. It was part of a special package that they called the 5th Avenue edition (instead of being its own model, the 5th Ave used to be one of those designer-type packages, like a Bill Blass Lincoln, I guess) that added about $1500 to the base price of the New Yorker. The 5th Ave also added the Driftplood accents on the inside, fake vents on the fenders, and a ""Fifth Avenue"" script in the opera windows that lit up at night. It also had those dorky wire wheels, which are now in one of my sheds...I have copcar wheels and little dog-dish hubcaps on it now! I'm guessing they just called the leather ""Designers Leather"" or something dumb like that. I remember the color scheme is called ""Designer Creme"" over ""Designer Beige"" How original.

And I'm the same way when it comes to looking at houses...the first thing I look for is how big the garage is, and if there's enough room to add on to it! One of my friends has a townhouse with a garage that barely holds his Passat. Well, he recently went out and bought a Mark V. Needless to say, it won't fit! :surprise: And I guess this garage shows where my priorities are...the house could really use a new roof, new windows, paint, and a whole bunch of other work, and yet I focus on the garage!

Mark, the reason they were able to build the garage this way, before a complete foundation is poured, is because technically it's a pole barn. Here's a drawing of the footer plan for it, that I had to have an engineer draw up after the drilling crew ended up hitting groundwater on just about every single hole. Originally they were just going to pour 8 inches of concrete in the bottom, but the new plan called for digging the holes deeper, putting in 12"" of gravel, and then 12"" of concrete. As for building the garage then, the crew just set the poles in, and as they started nailing up the sides that connected the poles, it ultimately stabilized itself. They also poured a little bit of concrete around the poles to hold them in place, because I guess it could flex a bit otherwise, if a strong enough wind hit it.

I'm kinda curious too though, about how they're going to get more gravel in there to level the floor off though, and then pour the concrete, but the man doing it said it should be no sweat! I just hope he's right!

Also, I'm glad SOMEONE thinks my collection of cars is neat. Would you guys like to come over sometime and try to convince my family to my way of thinking? :P"
4394	October 23, 2005 3:31AM	stickguy	just curious, but it seems like the barn (err, garage) is awfully far from the house. Did you put it way out because you wanted it far away, or did the PsTB make you do it?
4395	October 23, 2005 4:53AM	andre1969	"Lemme guess? Powers That Be? They had some say in where I put the garage, but I decided from the get-go that I wanted it down that far in the yard. It's about 150 feet from the steps to my deck. But I kinda like it down there, because it's out of the way. It also makes the yard feel bigger, being down there kind of at the edge of the yard, although it's actually still about 50 feet from the property line on that side.

The county made me put it 90 feet back from the road, though. Originally, I wanted to make it 60 feet back. I was under the impression you only had to be 25 feet back from the road, and 15 feet from your neighbors' property line. But then I found out that 25 feet is only for the main house. Any secondary detached buildings have to be at least 60 feet back. But to make matters worse, the county has it on their books that they want 30 feet of my land for a right-of-way to expand the road! :mad: They'll either get it over my dead body, but I'm really not that concerned about it...supposedly it's been on the books since the 70's, and most likely the only way the road would get widened would be if a developer came through and bought up me and all the neighbors tore it all down, and put up a development. And then I wouldn't care, because we'd all be paid off and gone! But anyway, they tacked that 30 feet onto the 60 foot requirement, making me put it back 90 feet. I ended up having to take down about 5 or 6 trees that were growing up at the edge of the woods, some of them leaning outward, and had to clear out a lot of brush. So, to make up for that, I'm going to let some of the yard out towards the road grow back up and plant some trees here and there...just not too close to the garage!

And eventually, the house is either going to get moved or torn down and replaced, and when that time comes, the site I want to build on will be down closer to the garage. So that's another reason I put it that far down, so it wouldn't be practically up against the house when that time comes."

What saved the car is that it has a dirt floor. All the moisture is absorbed into the ground and it keeps the barn at a more even temperature that has worked in keeping the car from decaying. I think the barn is in Virginia.

I used to keep a half dozen cars in the fleet like that, but found I was never driving them all enough, so I let some go. Recently however, I have been looking around for an early 80s Supra to make car number three in the fleet. Sadly, a nice one has not yet materialized. At least there are still plenty around."

I most likely will trade in December as I usually do. I've had two Jeep Grand Cherokee Limiteds in the past ('96 and '99) so I was interested in the new Commander. Completely loaded, it appears it will have a MSRP of about $43,000 or so with Navigational and the HEMI. I was surprised that the HEMI has the fuel economy of 15 city, 19 hwy. I can live with that. I usually always get better than the posted mpg listed because I'm an easy driver.

The second row seats have ""sky lights"" that have a sun shade to close them off. I would imagine if you carry something heavy on the roof, that you would want to cover them so that they don't get scratched. But, I never put stuff on the roof myself.

I always liked those older Supras. I think my favorite was the later 80's model, which I think ran from 1987-1991 or so? I didn't care for the final-gen...too over-the-top ""Fast and Furious"" for my tastes (although I guess some people would consider tailfins and chrome and two-toning to be over-the-top). The older ones were a better balance, I thought. Sporty yet tasteful."
4401	October 26, 2005 1:30PM	andre1969	if nothing else, those copcar wheels and wide tires do make the NYer handle pretty well. In dry weather, at least. Although they do tend to make the axle-hop worse, which is already kinda noticeable because the car has leaf springs in the back. I still have the wire hubcaps, so I guess I could always put them on the copcar wheels.
4402	October 26, 2005 2:48PM	nippononly	"nope, your eyes do not deceive. Of all the domestic cars over the years, the Chryslers are generally the ones I have most liked the looks of. That is certainly true today, with the 300. :-)

Now if only they will do something great with the Sebring/Stratus next year, but alas, the initial pics I have seen make it seem as if they won't be changing the looks that much from the current cars. Which are far from memorable. :-(

As for the Supras, yes, the series you are thinking of ran from 1986 to 1992, although they were not my favorite series for styling. They were also the series when Toyota used a temperamental head gasket engendering many expensive repairs and an extended manufacturer warranty, as well as its first use of an adjustable suspension which was too soft in all settings and which is ENORMOUSLY expensive to replace as the car ages.

My fave is the 82-85, chunky square style. The '84 I am looking at now has the 161 hp engine, 140K original miles, and a new paint job the owner has called ""polo green"" in his e-mail. What is polo green? Is that light or dark? I may go look at it this weekend."

4407	October 26, 2005 6:21PM	stickguy	check out the Honda run run out thread. Found a mention that Honda was finally working on a RWD platform (for passenger cars). Might finally get that RWD 3 series fighter you want.
4408	October 29, 2005 8:05PM	anonymousposts	"sounds great. Let's see if it materializes any time soon.

We have found something that may knock us off the wagon. 2003 MDX Touring with 55,000 miles for $22,000. Gray with gray leather. Clean. NAV. We'll see what they offer us for the Ody.

We also were at the Honda dealer getting the oil changed in the Accord and we sat in a new Odyssey Touring with RES/NAV. What an awesome van! But it was $40,000. The Ody is nicer than the MDX but the MDX is AWD and nearly $20,000 less than the Ody."
4409	October 29, 2005 8:10PM	michaellno	"Have been in serious discussions today with 2 Hyundai dealers regarding a Sonata as a replacement for the Focus.

Drove three Hyundai's last night:

'05 Elantra GT w/ auto, sunroof and ABS/TC. 138HP, sticker of $17,700
'06 Tucson GLS V6 AWD, auto, no options. 173HP, sticker of $21,xxx
'06 Sonata GL, 2.4L 4-cyl, auto, no options. 162HP, sticker of $19,480

Of the three, the daughter liked the Sonata best (andre and lemko, perhaps she's channeling you two!). Went home to think about it.

The dealer we were at only had the one GL in stock, so I went on-line to see what else is available. Found another dealer here in Denver with 10 GL auto's on the lot, including the color we were looking for (silver).

Discussions with the second dealer boiled down to a quote of $17,165 (after rebates), plus TTL for the silver GL 4 banger w/ automatic. Also, they would have to evaluate the Focus to figure out what it's worth in trade.

The dealer we were at last night called and offered the following deal:

'06 Sonata GLS V6 (the 4-cyl we drove last night got sold) for $18,165 (after rebates) + TTL, plus they offered me $8500 for the Focus, sight unseen.

I owe just over $8800 on the Focus, so this seems to be a great deal. Standard features on the Sonata GLS V6 include ABS, traction control, stability control, 6 airbags, power everything, keyless remote, fog lights and a whole bunch more.

Then, as I was mulling these offers over, my daughter called from work and put everything into a tailspin.

She wants to look further, perhaps at the Saturn ION, as it now comes with an AUX jack for her iPod standard. Her reasoning is that if she's going to drive this car for the next 3/5/7 years, she should make sure she gets what she really wants, and not just do a deal on the first car that we look at.

So, we may go take a closer look at Saturns later today. Her mom simply rolled her eyes."
4410	October 29, 2005 8:31PM	anonymousposts	"have to take the Hyundai over the Ion.

I still think you should give the 06 Civic a shot. It comes standard with all of the important safety features and it gets great gas mileage. It will also hold it's value well more than likely."
4411	October 29, 2005 8:34PM	kyfdx	"$22K for 3-year old MDX with high miles? I wouldn't... That is five years of payments at $420/month...

I'd rather go lease a Honda Pilot or Ridgeline... They have killer deals, and at the end of three years you'll probably be out less cash, and certainly less for repairs and maintenance than for that used car...

regards,
kyfdx"
4412	October 29, 2005 8:49PM	anonymousposts	"Honda's current lease deal on the Pilot is $289 per month + tax for a EX 2WD and $1500 down. MSRP of a EX 2WD is $29,000 while MSRP of the EX-L AWD with NAV is $35,000. Over 42 months you would have to add another $119 to equal the equipment of the MDX. Now you are up to $408 per month + tax. Pretty darn close to what the MDX will cost me. Difference is that I can sell the MDX at any time and probably not lose that much money. The same probably can't be said for a car I am leasing for 42 months.

Also, the Pilot has the column shifter and the interior isn't quite as nice IMO. I'm also not thrilled with the 06 freshening of the Pilot. If we go through the credit union they will give me an extended warranty. If we don't use it they refund the entire cost. If we do use it then more than likely it has paid for itself.

We could always buy the Odyssey at the end of the lease but it's missing a couple of things we want. Also, it was a great deal when we leased it and a so-so deal if we buy it at the end. In any event, it's all contingent on what they offer us for the Odyssey."
4413	October 29, 2005 8:54PM	kyfdx	"If you don't like the Pilot, I understand.... though, I think you could do better than the advertised lease deal...

But, that Acura.. too many miles, plus have you seen the price of gas? :surprise:

I think you'd have a harder time getting your money back out than you think, but I do agree about the increased flexibility of owning... I'm just not wild about $22K for a car that is that used.

And, yes.. good lease deals usually make for poor purchases at lease end.. No disagreement there...

4414	October 29, 2005 8:54PM	ghulet	I think sticker on a new Civic LX sedan with automatic is ~$17.3, and I think in the long run (the 5-7 years she will likely have the car), it will cost less in gas and depreciation than any Hyundai or Saturn, if history is any indication. Of course, the warranty on Hyundais is tempting, but that's about the best argument for buying one I can think of right now.
4415	October 29, 2005 9:06PM	anonymousposts	"but we have only put 16,000 miles on our Ody in close to 18 months. We might end up trading our Si too as part of this deal so we might put a few more miles on the MDX than we are on the Ody but it will not be our primary car. Gee will start driving his Lexus more and we will spend more time in the Accord. The MDX will be for trips and Home Depot/Walmart runs.

I'll admit it's not a bargain basement price but at $22000 it's right at trade value and a few grand less than what we would typically pay at a dealer. It's also $19,000 off MSRP for a new one.

We thought of it like this ... we were thinking about buying an Element which would've cost us around $20,000 + tax/accessories. For a bit more we are getting a nicer car with more options and close to the same MPG. It may have 55,000 miles but it's still an Acura so I have more faith in it than I would in a Mercedes or BMW that was out of warranty.

Although if you think it's that bad of a deal you can always pay the difference and we'll buy a new one"
4416	October 29, 2005 10:07PM	millspd	"Hey Anonymous,

I think I remember you mentioned that your husband is pretty tall. Has he sat in the Element? I'm 6' 4"" and while I had plenty of head room (though not as much as the Scion xB), the layout of the dash/steering wheel cut off the top part of the speedo for me unless I *really* reclined the seat, which defeated the point of thinking about that vehicle for me anyway.

Just thought I'd pass that along

Paul"
4417	October 29, 2005 10:14PM	ghulet	"....and I don't think she was anywhere near 6'4"". Seems like Honda should have addressed that by now, since the Element has been out for three years."
4418	October 29, 2005 10:28PM	anonymousposts	Gee fit great in the Element although he likes a cozy cabin to begin with. His daily driver is a Civic Si so the Element had plenty of room to him.

4421	October 29, 2005 11:06PM	woodyww	The only thing worse than one Hyundai, would be three Hyundai's. Seriously, you can buy......a new Honda Civic, or even Accord, for those prices, or less.

We are on the wagon for at least 3 more years (amount of time left on the Titan's lease), need to just chill and concentrate on our business.

Apparently the car is red and has lowish mileage, under 100K, and is a nicely maintained example. The price seems too cheap...I can't logically justify such a purchase, and buying it would require a bit of economic reorganization...but it might be something to flip for a profit, if it is as nice as I've heard.
4426	October 30, 2005 7:38PM	anonymousposts	$17,000 for a 34 year old Mercedes is much worse than $22,000 for a 2-3 year old Acura.

4428	October 30, 2005 8:24PM	woodyww	"A few years ago, I almost bought a brand new MDX Touring. Using my brilliant decision making however, I instead bought a 2 1/2 y.o. Range Rover for almost the same price. A year later, freaking out at the thought of a LR with no warranty, I had to eat about $10K (between depreciation & maintenence costs) when I traded it. I should have bought the Acura.......btw, what's an accord ""VP""?"
4429	October 30, 2005 8:28PM	fintail	"You should be able to find a very nice 560SL for 15K, yes. A couple years ago I saw a lovely 70K mile 88 560SL, diamond blue with chrome wheels, one owner, both tops etc, for 15K. I almost wnt for it, to match my 126. It sold in a few days.

But a 107 560SL is a different animal than a 113 280SL. A nice 113 should be worth at least 50% more than a 107 - an older, prettier car.

I know the 113 problems are rust, rust, rust. Some 450SLs (75-76 IIRC) can have lots of mechanical issues. The newer 129 cars just suffer from neglect, as maintenance is pricey."

I had been reading your posting of the 55,000 mile MDX and I don't see the attraction to it or trying to compare it to a new 2006. It ""IS"" $19,000 cheaper than a new one and has been used accordingly and a little too much if you ask me. :confuse:

I have a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud III (white with parchment leather) that I have had for 7 years and I still can get at least what I paid for it including the few repairs that I had done. So, I've had little or no depreciation. I think the ""lil"" Mercedes might fall in the same category depending on the condition. Those SL's are in demand to a collector or car enthusiast.

4431	October 30, 2005 9:22PM	anonymousposts	"My post was made in jest. I know there's no comparing the two cars and/or deals.

The MDX is in beautiful shape. Similar MDX's at local no-haggle car dealerships are going for $25,000-$28,000. The MDX will not be used as a daily driver so we won't put more than 10,000-12,000 miles per year on it. When the Odyssey lease ends we will have to replace it with something that can haul us + stuff + my 3 nieces at times. The new Ody that I would want costs about $40,000. I could buy a new MDX but I don't feel that's necessary.

""It ""IS"" $19,000 cheaper than a new one and has been used accordingly and a little too much if you ask me

I don't feel a new one is worth $19,000 more than this one. Any other new small van/SUV will be just as expensive. A CR-V is $20,000+ now. For the money I'll take my chances on the 55,000 mile MDX. Sure, a thing or two might go wrong with it in which case we will fix it or just sell it and cut our losses. ."

4435	October 31, 2005 3:49PM	stickguy	"for some reason, car makers seem to be going out of there way to keep the addicted from getting a fix. The latest offender is VW. Got all worked up about a killer lease offer on a Passat. But, after some poking around, the ""driver's wanted"" company decided that any driver that wants a moonroof also wants an auto tranny. Yup, they are following the Hyundai model (on the Sonata) and have decided that if you want to row your own gears, you must not like sun on your head.

But, a friend has got me perculating about a Legacy. Turns out that you can get a very nicely equipped Legacy 2.5i SE for quite an attractive price, and it seems to be pretty loaded. And get this, it can be (theoretically) had with a 5 speed and a moonroof! Probably only going to retail for about 20K that way too. Lot's of car for loaded Mazda3 money.

Now just have to go drive it to find out what the fatal flaw is (they all seem to have one..). I think lack of stereo controls on the steering wheel might be an issue, but I can accept that if it has great seats and drives nice.

Can probably also sell the AWD to the wife as a safety feature, along with all the air bags, for our son who starts driving in 1.5 years. At least he already said he wants to learn on the stick (that's my boy!)

I like the Legacy concept. A little smaller than the compitition, but still plenty of roomy for what I need, which is a little bigger than a sub compact (3/Civic/etc.), but less than a full boat barge. Kinda the mama bear car.

A legacy is probably a good car to learn on. Easy to drive, manageable size, good visibility, and safe. Not to mention built like a tank.

Saturday was crazy. Test drove the ION ... daughter deemed it suitable for her needs.

BUT....

After further discussion, I think we decided (today, at least; check back tomorrow 'cuz we may have changed our mind) that the kid doesn't really need a car at college, for the following reasons:

--> Everything she needs is on campus
--> As a student, she is entitled to a free bus pass for the city bus system
--> Mom and I can come visit when she gets homesick
--> If she doesn't have a car, she won't need to work. We can send her the money we would be spending on a car payment directly to her for an ""allowance"".

So, the plan is to sell the Focus outright next summer before she goes away (only about 80-90 miles from home - 2 hour drive) and then we'll become a two car family (VUE for wife and L300 for me).

Should the kid decide she really wants a car, she can first get a job and we can get her something at that time .. this way, she is not obligated to work and can concentrate on her studies.

I did, however, lay some groundwork with the wife regarding the acquisition of a Saturn SKY in a couple of years. We'll see."

We like the Odyssey, but a lease for 24 whole months is too confining. The Pilot lease is decent, but it is for 42 freakin' months. I would take on another 24 month lease, but I can't see one much longer than that. 36 months would be a stretch.

My wife does have a little record going for buying a car every even year. When we met she had a new '94. Since then (see if you can follow me here) she bought a '96, '98, '00, '02, '04. It would ruin her streak if I didn' get her a new '06 when her lease is up."
4442	October 31, 2005 6:04PM	spiritinthesky	"I'll second stickguy's comments.

Too many kids - and some parents - forget what college is supposed to be for. One of the guys I went to graduate business school with didn't have a car back then and it didn't seem to hurt him. Last year, he gave the business school $55 million, it's now named after him, and he is #283 on the Forbes 400. Another frugal classmate of ours is set to receive a few hundred million when the Chiron sale is concluded.

Have her stick to the books."
4443	October 31, 2005 6:18PM	woodyww	"Can you pay for them to certify the MDX? A warranty would be nice on such an expensive vehicle with AWD, etc. (even an Acura), & apparently there were trans. failures on some.

I still think--for the price--it sounds like a good deal (& I'm usually a low-mileage fanatic). Unless of course there's no warranty, & the trans. went......."
4444	October 31, 2005 8:15PM	michaellno	"Thanks for the feedback. The CCBA side of me wants to pull the trigger on something, anything, so that I can get my Saturn back, but the logical side of me says that this is the correct course of action.

We did discuss the parking issue --- cost of parking pass + scarcity of parking places + little need to have a car, unless she has an off-campus job (and the only reason she would need a job is to pay for -- you guessed it -- the car!) --- and decided that the status can remain quo for the time being.

And, as mentioned above, should she decide that a car is necessary, we can always get her one.

We're hoping that the college experience will be good for her .. she's sorta shy and not real social and has to be forced into doing things she might not otherwise do.

I don't worry too much about her academically - she's holding a 3.9 GPA at the moment and is ranked in the top 10% of her graduating class. Currently, her goal is to pursue an undergraduate degree in Microbiology (I think) with a minor in Zoology in preparation for veterinary school - Colorado State has a top 5 ranked vet school in the US, so if all goes according to plan, she'll be up there for a good number of years."
4445	October 31, 2005 9:24PM	woodyww	"Holy Cow! How much could she work studying those subjects anyway? I know from experience that working a lot can really affect your studies (as can many other activities that I ""researched"" when in college).

*an undergraduate degree in Microbiology (I think) with a minor in Zoology*"
4446	October 31, 2005 10:42PM	michaellno	"During our campus visit last Friday, we were shown a slide that compared GPA's of kids who work vs. kids who didn't work.

Surprisingly, kids who work have a slightly higher GPA, and the difference actually widens as you go from Frosh > Soph > Jr > Sr years. Supposedly, it is due to better time management skills. However, we're talking about a part time job of 10 to 15 hours per week and a 15 unit courseload.

woodyvw - she's always been a hard worker in school; in fact, this year (senior year of HS), her courses this semester include:
-> college algebra
-> spanish II
-> economics
-> creative writing
-> physics
-> jewelry making

next semester, she's got:
-> college algebra
-> spanish II
-> US history since 1945
-> creative writing
-> physics
-> astronomy

We'll see how things turn out .. she has to live in the dorms her freshman year, but can move off campus after that. If that's the case, it's pretty likely that she'll need a car. OTOH, a nice bicycle might work well for her, too."

You know, I forgot my golden rule, which is... ""EVERY CAR HAS A BUYER""!! I still don't see the attraction to a 3 year old 55,000 mile MDX but that's just me. As often as you and your husband change cars it's probably a good money savings but I see it as mostly used up.

I'm looking at a 2006 Jeep Commander as my 2002 Mercedes ML500 replacement in December. It's hard for me to consider another vehicle as I really like the Commander. It does bring back memories of the troubles I had with my '96 and '99 Grand Cherokee Limited's but maybe Chrysler has gotten the bugs worked out. We'll see. :surprise: I'm going to continue to read everything thing I can about the experiences of current owners with this vehicle so that I can make a better ""educated"" decision.

And you ARE hoping someone wants that ML so that you can get a decent trade. I'll let Anony go into the whole demand thing setting the price of used vehicles but I'm sure you get where I'm going.

I'll also let her describe her new MDX. But we did buy it. And it is nice. I think that makes number 37 or so in 10 years. And the next couple are in the planning stages. No more leases unless it's an AWESOME deal."

I think you should be safe with it for the next few years (not that you'll have it that long), as long as it's been cared for; it's a newish car at half the price. It also should have done a great deal of its depreciation by now, as long as you don't put too many more miles on it.

Michaell, speaking from personal experience (albeit some 18 years ago), if I had college to do over again, I probably would have left the car out of the equation. I had an older, 'paid for' car, but it still caused me some financial problems and enabled me to go home on weekends a bit too much (though my situation was a bit different--when I was accepted to school, 'home' was two hours away (Park Forest to DeKalb, IL), after I started college, mom moved to St. Louis and Dad to NJ; nice, eh?). Unless she's going somewhere really rural, it's usually not too hard to get around campus, and in most cases (especially since you're two hours drive), it's not too hard to get home. IIRC, Freshman weren't technically even allowed to have cars at NIU, campus parking was a bit scarce. Almost nobody I knew had a car there."
4453	November 1, 2005 4:10AM	mark156	"Dear Gee, 37 cars in 10 year??? That's alot of cars! I think I'm at 14 in 25 years.

I'm hoping that trading a SUV for another SUV I'll come out OK. If the trade-in value on the ML is too far off.... I'll keep the ML or sell it to my niece at a ""family"" price. I'm not going to give the ML away, it looks really good for the mileage and age.

I'm sure you and Anony will have good luck with the MDX as they are nice vehicles. Personally, I like to buy cars new (except for my antique). I'm hoping that my ML will have value for someone as it has a third seat and fully loaded with nav, parktronic, 6-CD, new tires, new brakes, etc. In about a month, I'll ask Terry what he thinks the value is worth.

Obviously, we need people who love used cars as those of us who prefer new want to sell our previous cars; there has to be a balance between the two.

Congrats on the new purchase... your membership is at the Platinum for sure!

PS. I have a friend who has a 94 Lexus LS400 who uses it as a spider condo too... it's very close to 50,000 miles and my friend is trying to hold it back as long as possible before the big ""roll-over"""
4454	November 1, 2005 12:21PM	gee35coupe	"Just makes more sense to use the money for something else. It's been fun though. Another thing is that the MDX made me want something with a little more updated luxury. I also went to the ""Taste of Lexus"" and the new IS is really ringing my bell. I drove the LS yesterday and when I did a couple of quick transitions it reminded that it's a BIG car. With a very soft suspension. After driving the Accord and even worse, the Civic with it's Eibachs and big rear roll bar, I don't like driving the LS at all any more. The Ody had more roll stiffness.
Don't get me wrong, I still love looking at it and it's still a very nice car with years of use left in her. I just don't think those years wil be with me. I'm gonna miss it.

Now to the future...Looking forward to buying my new wheels, sidebars, hood deflector and other stuff for our new truck. And shopping for my IS for next Christmas is gonna make for a fun 2006."

4457	November 1, 2005 2:33PM	gee35coupe	"Paid $22.3K for the MDX. With the sales tax being covered almost totally by the difference we ended up getting the MDX for about $24.5K OTD. Not bad IMHO for a 2003 MDX Touring with 55K on it.

I'm Ebaying a lot of stuff for it as we speak..err type."
4458	November 1, 2005 2:43PM	lemmer	How does the payoff for the minivan work? Did you have to pay all of the remaining lease payments in addition to the residual, or what?
4459	November 1, 2005 2:48PM	gee35coupe	I don't think it was the remaining payments + residual though. But I may be wrong. We looked at it as getting out of the van for pretty cheap considering what we saved on sales tax. 7% of $22K is like $1500.
4460	November 1, 2005 2:58PM	lemmer	"We only pay 3.375% sales tax on car purchases. Did you pay sales tax up front on your lease?

4463	November 1, 2005 7:50PM	woodyww	I don't think (?) that you can upgrade to xenon's (HID's) just by replacing the bulbs. At least on bmw's, it requires a major retrofit. Unless it has xenon's now already? Or do you just want to get brighter Halogens?

-pre-1988, drove my parents' hand-me-downs
-1988 honda accord dx coupe, crank windows et al., kept 13.5 years, gave to brother-in-law
-1994 mb c280, gift from brother-in-law after death of sister, sold to pay off mtg
-carless for 1.5 years, rode bike, bus, and walked
-gifted with 1994 maxima with 175K miles on receiving, this is my current drive, and this car is so not me (power everything, leather everything, big, bulky, unwieldy, inefficient, vulgar, etc.) that it isn't funny. It gets horrible mpgs but it gets me around.

I have never understood why people get so much pleasure out of owning so many different cars. I was always nervous about my financial future, in a way that greatly outweighed any desire to own a new car. In the late 90s I had a terrible hankering for a VW TDI but I didn't want car payments on top of mortgage payments and gradually the feeling passed.

I guess you car junkies are fabulously well-to-do or something, because I would never have the nerve to actually buy car a year, or even once a decade! .It isn't that I don't like cars. I just like not having payments more.

I probably will make my second purchase within a few years, however. I would like to have something that is somewhat in line with my values: extremely efficient, understated, and reliable. At the moment, I have only the third."

Fabulously well-to-do my foot... I just bought a $6 car this year, kept it 7 months and 6k miles, and sold it... money lost, $1200 with taxes, fees etc.... The gain was a 3rd car that kept the miles of the good van and saved the missus a lot of loading and unloading for her business.

The cost was $170/month if you work it out. Not dirt-cheap, but well worth it. And I don't do car payments either...

As constant car shoppers I can tell you that we haven't met a car that we couldn't trade. I was in the MDX today cruising the Honda lot hoping to catch an early SI or something.

But payments are a fact of life. We swipe everything so at the end of the month we have credit card payments. All of our utilities and etc. go to another card so there's another bill. Then theres the aforementioned mortgage, insurance, taxes, diapers, etc The list goes on. Life is a payment.

Not bad considering we put no money down on the lease and still had 6 months left. The final total was $24,100 - $300 refund = $23,800. We were happy with $21000 for the Ody. Terry said high $20's-low $21's. He said we should trade for the Ody + $4000 or so. We ended up at $2800 including TTL.

The MDX drives great. The dual front 8-way power seats means Gee can get more comfy when he isn't driving. The NAV is a fun toy and came in useful the first night when we were going a new way to my sister's house. We will take pictures soon and post them. Surprisingly clean vehicle for the mileage.

We do spend a lot on cars but we also save more than we spend. I have 401k, stock, savings and Gee has savings and a ROTH. We also have quite a bit of home equity as a crutch should we need it. So while at the surface we may seem irresponsible we are far from it.

Currently, the plan is to sell the Focus outright next summer before kid goes off to college; that leaves the VUE for the wife and the L300 for me.

Only 25 more payments on the L300 (geez, that sounds like a lot!), but I'm hoping to pay it off early as my child support obligations cease in about 18 months or so.

Will be nice to have a bit of extra cash flow in our budget.

What's funny is that by the time next summer rolls around, the Focus and the L will probably have the same amount of miles on them (45-50K). Wife asked if we'll break even on the Focus -- I'm pretty certain that we will, given that we owe about $8800 on it at the moment and the private party sale price, according to Edmunds, is about $9K. I imagine the numbers will only get better, as long as I don't put a huge number of miles onto the Focus (33K at the moment).

Next step, however, is to get new shoes for the Focus ... the OEM Goodyears don't look like they are going to survive another Colorado winter."

2005 Chrysler Town & Country Touring (May/05-curr) Lease for the first kid!
2005 Dodge Dakota QC V8 (Sep/05-curr) $2280 2yr lease special

I could use some advice from other CCBAers. I could not pass up the Dakota lease special (no payments for 24k miles) and originally intended to sell/trade the Supercrew. That would save a nice $564/mo for the 18 months we use the Dakota miles up, plus whatever equity I can get out of it (maybe $3k @ private sale) However, I'm now considering keeping rgw F-150 to drive once the Dakota goes bye-bye. The F-150 would be a 4yr old vehicle with 34k miles and $8k left to pay it off. It has a lot of equipment, so replacing it with a new 2007/2008 model would mean spending $5-7k more for an equivalent truck. I'd love to step up to a diesel 1-ton, but that's $15k more than I paid for my 03 F-150. And, the 3.99% rate I got @ my CU won't be beat for many years, maybe ever. When we move next year to a larger house for a growing family, the budget will get crunched for a couple years.

To complicate the problem, keeping the F-150 would mean I drive it once Dakota (in which wife commutes now) goes. Wife works for DCX and can park closer if driving a DCX product, so she's done w/ non DCX commuters. I love driving the F-150, but 80miles/day @12mpg is costly. I volenteered to drive the minivan when we got it because my wife was a non-believer. We bought extra miles for that lease, but is easy to go over. I'd love to pay for F-150 fuel for a year, pay the truck off and either have no car payment with lots of fuel or keep it as a recreational vehicle (towing, yard/housework) and buy something more economical for the commute. Wife will most likely lease a minivan about the same time as Dakota goes to commute (she's giving in). Or, I could sell the F-150, keep my two lease vehicles and take the risk there will be something inexpensive to lease/buy in 18 months. I don't like having only lease vehicles with as many miles as I drive to work plus weekend family trips. FYI, wife only drives 30m/day.

So, my requirement in 3 years and beyond is to have a minivan (prefer lease, not buy) and a truck. I prefer not to commute in a minivan (gimmie the fun manaul tranny car, please), and a truck is not economical. So, truck = 3rd vehicle and/or no payment primary commuter.

So, do I sell the Supercrew now?"
4490	November 2, 2005 8:40PM	qbrozen	huh? did i miss something? a free dakota??
4491	November 2, 2005 9:16PM	stickguy	"q: That's all you missed out of that?

I think it was a 1-pay lease for $2,280 if I interpret his list correctly."
4492	November 2, 2005 9:20PM	qbrozen	"Is that all i missed? well, no, but i'm starting small.

yeah, i saw that $2280 in the list, too, but .... but .... then its NOT 24k miles with no payments ... right?? And, anyway, what deal was this that you could get a dakota for less than $100 a month?!"
4493	November 2, 2005 9:22PM	stickguy	"well, that's about all I would pay for one!

might be an insider deal, but he also referred to 18 months later on, so maybe that is it?"
4494	November 2, 2005 9:28PM	qbrozen	"ouch. hey, now, i really liked my dakota.

ok, ok, so 14 mpg really hurt, but it was still a pleasure to drive. Heck, just about any new vehicle is worth $100 a month to rent. (alright, let's just toss the bottom end hyundais, kias, and suzukis out of that statement)"
4495	November 2, 2005 9:37PM	gee35coupe	"I hated it. It was nice looking though. I traded it for my Civic Si. While I'm posting I just wanna say..

""I love my wife""!!!

I wanted to type this earlier but I didn't have anything else to say. Have you ever been sitting around bored and just started missing something? Earlier I was bored and Anony was in a meeting at work and I couldn't call her. We talk a million times a day and I missed her at that moment. It sucked. I need a job."
4496	November 2, 2005 9:59PM	aaron_t	"Yes, sorry for not being clear. I wrote a check for $2279 including taxes and plates for a year for a 2yr/24k mile lease on a 2005 Dakota SLT Quad Cab with only the V8/auto and tow package.. No further payments. So, < $100/mo OTD effectively. Yes, special circumstances for employees & family members only with lots of rebates ($1.5k employee bonus cash + $2k lease loyalty on top of employee price and regular Joe rebates). I figure we'll use the 24k miles up in about 18 months and turn it in. It's pre-paid, so I can turn it in as early as I want. $2280 for 24k miles, however long that takes to use up. The Stratus was a similar special for 1yr/12k miles. I'm still kicking myself for not buying that outright for $9500 after the lease. Not that it was a great car, but better than I was expecting and oh so cheap commuting transportation for many years.

The Dakota is fine. The engine/tranny is nice for its weight. The back seat is larger than the Quad Cab Ram. Nice for the reverse facing child seat and not have mom kiss the dash in the front passenger seat. Bonus for the ride hight, about the same as the minivan for getting the kid bucked in. So far, 15mpg. Better than 12 F-150, but way fewer creature comforts. It's all relative.

I liked the late 90's Civis Si, but not the last two. I'll get a fun car again some day. I'd love a Miata. I haven't tried sitting in one yet (tall), but maybe the 2006 is large enough?"

I have been looking for a cherry one for the past 15 years."
4501	November 3, 2005 3:15AM	gee35coupe	One of my favorite cars. I swore I would never own anything but wankel engines. That engine is intoxicating.

Prices on the used ones are not too bad, and I like that they added a rear seat(for kids anyway).But I do not have a prayer of getting comfortable.

I like that Mazda is keeping the rotary engine alive though."

4504	November 3, 2005 3:04PM	qbrozen	"Wow! Not even a stripped down version of the dakota. That's an incredible deal. Dodge obviously took a bath on that.

Unless they changed it drastically since my '97 Dakota, I think its a great truck (other than the mileage). I only had the extended cab and found it very comfortable with a tremendous amount of torque and a really nice stereo with the infinity speakers (i still rate it as the 2nd best stock stereo I've ever owned)."
4505	November 3, 2005 3:48PM	guss	"I remember I could not wait for the Miata to come out in '89. One trip to the showroom on the day they came out and I realized 6'6"" will never fit in a Miata.

I went the RX-7 covert route too, but could just never get as excited about them.

So I ended up with a 10 year old Fiat Spyder. Needless to say I got to know Tony well.

Right now I have one eye out for a cheap MR-2 Spyder. Maybe with the weather changing someone will need to unload one."
4506	November 3, 2005 4:20PM	nippononly	it is funny how many posters here have owned an RX-7 at some point and still think back on it fondly. Mine was an '88, gold color, fantastic if temperamental car (I still remember you couldn't move it in the driveway when cold and turn it back off, or it would flood and couldn't be restarted without special procedures. My eyes almost fell out of my head in surprise when I discovered this condition STILL EXISTS on the RX-8??). I should have kept it, but it was amazingly bad on gas for the level of performance it had, and expensive to insure. But ohhhh, so much fun! :-)

4510	November 3, 2005 4:50PM	gee35coupe	You can fit in a Mr2 Spyder? I'm 6'6' and I can't fit behind the wheel at all. Same with the Corolla/Matrix. I also don't fit the new Civics.
4511	November 3, 2005 7:25PM	guss	"Yup, I fit. I am longer in the torso than in the legs. So with the top down I have no problems, with the top up it's a little confining. think it has a lot more legroom than the Miata.

I figure 90% of the time the top will be down. Unless of course I could move to Hawaii and do a Tom Magnum PI and never need a top.

Because I need to get two boats to the river, and that's all the car I got. My buddy's cars -- even the big trucks -- are usually not set up to transport ANYTHING on top. The sissies.

Size doesn't have much to do with it. The same thing happened with the Sienna (no paint damage though), but the Mercury Villager was fine. In the end, I realized I was driving an ungainly 4000-lb car just so I could go canoeing 4 times a year. I may have to get a trailer instead.

4545	November 7, 2005 6:22PM	jaserb	"Lately I find myself jonesing after super cheap wheels. A few months ago I kept seeing a mid 90s Ford Escort 2dr at a ratty car lot with $1500 on the windshield. Looked really sharp. If I had any reason at all to switch I'd have jumped on it. Now that's gone, but the local Subie dealer has a '93 Sentra XE 2 door that they're trying to dump for $1950. 5 speed, A/C, Cruise, CD, 124k miles. I've always liked that style of Sentra - I had an SE-R a couple of years ago. The 2 door doesn't even have the motorized seat belts. It's cute and red, and it needs a home.

Problem is I have 3 cars, all TIH. My old beater truck for bike hauling and yard work, the MPV for the family, and the Alfa Spider for sitting in the garage on jackstands while I tinker with it. The Sentra would be a phenomenal cheap-o commuter - I could probably drive it for 50k miles, get 35 MPG, and only need to replace maybe an alternator or a CV joint once in a while. But with a 5 mile one way commute I really can't justify a 4th car as a commuter, and it can't replace any of the other 3.

The really weird part is that last week there was a layoff at my work, and part of me was hoping I wouldn't make it through so I could find a job with a longer commute and thus justify buying that Sentra.

I've thought about splurging and buying something really nice - a TSX or Legacy GT would fit the bill. I could easily afford either one, but I've discovered the perverse appeal of driving something at the bottom of its depreciation curve. I've put maybe $400 into my pickup in the last year for tires, DIY timing belts and tensioners, and a few other little things. That's barely a monthly payment for anything nice, with no guarantee the ""nice car"" wouldn't need more upkeep. And my truck will be worth $2k as long as it runs good and looks OK, so I might as well keep piling on the miles.

Oh no no no -- I LOVE the $1k car.
The problem is they're so hard to come by that I'm opposed to looking for one. Now if one bobs in the river as it lazily drifts by, I will do my level best to schkoop it up.

Like the '91 Civic Si I wanted... yeah I'd buy it if it was drivable... but not when it needs $1,500 of suspension work.

As the poet sang:


Thousand dollar car it ain't worth nothin'
Thousand dollar car it ain't worth ..it.
Might as well take your $1000,
and set fire to it.

$1000 car ain't worth a dime,
You lose your $1000 every time.
Oh why did I ever buy,
a $1000 car.

$1000 car is gonna let you down,
More than it's ever gonna get you around.
Replace your gaskets and paint over your rust,
You'll still end up with something that you'll never trust.

$1000 car's life was through,
'bout 50,000 miles 'fore it got to you.
Oh why did I ever buy,
a $1000 car.

A $1000 car ain't even gonna roll,
til you throw at least another thousand in the hole.
Sink your money in it, and there you are
the owner of a 2,000 dollar 1,000 dollar car.
(guitar solo)

If you've only got a $1000.
You ought to just buy a good guitar.
Learn how to play it it'll take you farther,
than any old $1000 car.

If a $1000 car was truly worth a damn,
then why would anybody ever spend ten grand.
Oh why did I ever buy,
a thousand dollar car.

They look nice, and certainly a lot more distinctive than the last one, but like most high-end Japanese sedans, I just couldn't get excited. One of the partners at my firm just bought one, not sure if it has the technology package (I think it does, he claims it 'talks to you'). I do know it was difficult for him to lock and unlock it at first (perhaps he's not up to the challenge?). I tend to lean toward being a technophobe anyway, and I'm one of those people for whom the 'neat' things would fail when they'd work for 99 other people, so a car like that would probably just bug me. I'd probably be much happier with an Accord V6 manual, NAV sedan (with the '04 rear end, please, I like amber taillights) and the $12-15k savings, please.

I had one as a loaner for several days last spring when my TL 6-speed was in for repairs (red-light runner took off my front bumper) When I went to return it, the dealer asked me what it would take for me to ""upgrade"" to the RL. I told him it wasn't an upgrade - and I meant it. My TL 6-speed is a lot more fun to drive. Noticably quicker, better handling IMO, much better braking (thanks to the 6-speed's Brembos). Not to mention a 6-speed gearbox that is as good as any sedan's.

I'm not sure what techno do-dads or amenities that the 2006 RL has that the TL doesn't, other than the traffic based nav system. Which was very inaccurate in the DC area, I might add. We have the Bluetooth, voice activated Nav, DVD sound system, etc. But what is immediately apparant that the RL does have is an extra 600+ lbs of heft - without a noticably larger interior. If anyone says the RL is a fun to drive car, I have to question, as compared to what? A Buick maybe, a Lexus ES/LS maybe not, and a BMW 5-series, not in a million years.

The new BMW 550i 6-speed is indeed an upgrade to the TL 6-speed. But the 4,000 lb Acura RL with a slushbox isn't, IMO. So, if you really must buy a new Acura, get a TL 6-speed and put the savings in your kid's college fund.

The L300 was purchased somewhere in mid-month, three years ago ... now has 43K on it and serves as my daughter's mobile locker. I try to keep the outside clean, but the inside will need a good detailing when she turns it back over to me next summer. Looks good (seeing has how it has lived outside for the past 18 months), runs strong, and the dent resistent panels come in handy in the high school parking lot.

The Focus was purchased on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, two years ago. Now has 34K on it and serves as my daily driver. Just put new shoes on her last weekend (Falken Ziex) and we'll see how they do in the unpredictable weather here in Colorado. Other than that, she's done everything we've asked of her and returned ~30MPG in the process. Will probably get sold next summer when the daughter goes off to college.

The VUE was purchased on the Saturday after Thanksgiving last year. Now has something like 14-15K on it ... wife loves it to death. Nothing that 250HP can't solve, though I am worried that the crappy Bridgestone OEM tires are going to wear out quickly. There have been lots of bad tales told on various Saturn forums about these tires; specifically, their tendency to aquaplane at the drop of a hat. I've told the wife that if that should start to happen, to let me know and we will put new tires on it immediately. The problem is that they are an odd size (235/65-17, I think) and there aren't too many choices for a direct size replacement. Other than the concern over the tires, there really hasn't been a problem with the VUE.

Saturn service is as good as advertised, IMHO.

I think I'm out of the market for the time being, though I will always be tempted to look and see what's available.

PS. Son also bought his 2001 Saturn L200 on the same day we bought the VUE last November. Needed some major transmission work within 8 weeks of purchase, but now it runs like a top (2.2L 4 banger with a 5-speed). He just drove it to St. George, UT (approximately 650 miles)."

Since I burned out my 1991 Olds Bravada in '99 at 168k miles, I have owned a '99 ML320, a 2000 E320 Wagon, a 2002 RX 300, a 2004 Lincoln Aviator and a 2004 E320 Wagon. Also in there was a '04 325i convertible, which I still possess (along with the 04 E wagon.)

I have also helped a number of friends find their vehicles and deals.

I think I have found my place here.

Am now considering --ok, have placed an order for -- an 06 Benx R350. I have very rational reasons for all of this wanderlust, in addition to just enjoying the hunt, but sure have taken a beating in the court of friends and family public opinion.

Based upon your past selections (all station wagons and SUV's except the 325i) I have to believe that another form of ""recreation"" has been to produce at least a few kids to occupy all of those seats??

Regarding the R350/500, a funny story. This past weekend I packed my wife and two daughters in our 911 S Cabriolet to go to Annapolis for lunch. As we were leaving the DC area, we pulled up to a light next to an R500. My 7 year old, very observant, exclaimed ""Look, a Mercedes mini-van"". To which my wife, a longstanding fan of the Mercedes wagon, added, ""boy that's not very attractive"". I shut them up before the driver rolled down his window, looked down at us and said, ""Wow, I didn't think you could fit a family of four in a 911"". He had his wife and one kid in the R500. They had the big sunroof(s), but I could see more than a bit of envy of our open air 911 on a nice sunny 65 degree November Saturday.

So unless you are going to pack a lot of kids in that Mercedes ""mini-van"", may I offer an alternative that wouldn't cost a boatload more, but be a lot more fun to drive? The bonnet will hold a case or two of red wine and you can commute between your houses in record time. It might actually be fun enough that you can take a year or two reprieve form your affliction!"

Was just about ready to pull the trigger on a deal for a Hyundai Sonata a few weeks ago, but a moment of clarity came over all of us and we decided not to do the deal.

Shame, actually -- the Sonata is a very nice car. We didn't drive the V6 but the 4-cyl was peppy enough. Lots of room inside, nice standard features and a warranty that won't quit. Had two offers from two different dealers:

$17,235 for a 4-cylinder GL and $18,195 for a V6 GLS. On top of that, the dealer with the V6 deal wanted to give us $8500 for the Focus.

But, like I said, logic prevailed and we decided to put everything on hold. It's quite likely that the daughter won't need a car when she goes off to college next fall, so the Focus will get sold outright sometime next summer.

However, the itch persists.

albell: 1% of MSRP is what, $500? So you're talking about a $1000 difference (approximately) between the two offers. Could you go back to the upstate dealer with whom you have the deposit and tell them about the second offer? Perhaps they could match it?

BTW, how far upstate are you talking about? My dad was born and raised in Peekskill."

Also, there was (and still is, I believe) $1500 in rebates on the 4-cyl and $2000 on the V6 ($1K straight rebate, $1K for financing with Hyundai). The prices offered included those rebates, so the 4-cyl was $150 over invoice and the V6 was offered right at invoice, according to the numbers I found at Edmunds.

I didn't run the numbers for the LX V6 (top model trim w/ leather), but the only option I would have wanted was the sunroof - I suspect that I could get one for probably $21-22K after rebates, which isn't too bad of a deal since I paid $24K for my L300 3 years ago with 50 less horsepower."

4581	November 15, 2005 4:29PM	michaellno	Not a game, but trying to find the best deal. Do you live in the greater NYC area? Is the closer dealer the same one you would be using to have your car serviced? I guess it's a matter of looking at the big picture.

Again, you have a ""refundable"" deposit.....go ahead & feel a bit guilty if you wish, & donate 10% of the savings to a good charity; they need it more than any M-B dealer. Just my 2 cents.

The fact that you would even ask the question is evidence enough to me that you are an upstanding guy.

There is no need to apologize for wanting to get a good deal. If I were you, I'd go back to the Albany dealer and explain that you were called and offered the $1,200 better deal. You'd prefer to do business with them, so they don't need to beat it, but you'd like them to match it.

In both cases, this is an ""order"", so if the nearby dealership can live with a $500 over invoice deal, the Albany one should be able to.

P.S. Since my 911 temptation fell flat, how about the Range Rover Sport? Probably not as utilitarian as the R350, but one of the best looking interiors I have seen in any SUV and damn nice performance, even in the non-supercharged model.

Then her husband shattered the window trying to force it closed. She parked it in her garage for 8 months until she decided to sell her house - then she had to get rid of it. Of course by then it did not run - so no one was interested in it.

I bought it for $300, put a new battery in it and did a basic tune up and fluid change in her driveway. It started right up and I drove it home (50 miles) with no problems. Since then have probably put another $500 in it (and too much of my own time). Been using it as a parts getter and lifeboat.

Kinda feel a little guilty about this transaction, but hey it's a 14 year old car that has been beaten on and still has a few issues after my fixes above.

Thoughts on the guilt aspect of CCBA? Or the family/spouse related guilt?"
4593	November 16, 2005 12:26AM	downhomeinga	"I apologize in advance for the long post - but I need therapy - and luckily I found CCBA!

Then there is car #2 - purchased two weeks ago from another co-worker. A 1997 Maxima SE loaded with 162K miles in immaculate condition (dealer maintained since new). Co-worker overheated the car on the way home and had it towed in to a service station (that I had warned her did not sound reputable based on her prior experiences). They refill the radiator and do a pressure test - diagnosis blown head gasket due to the car continuing to overheat (but only at speed - not at idle).

They want $3300 to install a used motor. I am advising her all along that this does not sound like a blown head to me, but a cooling flow issue. Advise her to get a second opinion at a radiator shop nearby.

By this point she has full blown new car fever and has told the mechanic that she may be willing to sell the car as is. He offers her $600. I tell her that if she is going to go that route that I will double his offer to $1200. Again, advising her that I think she has a general cooling system problem - not a major engine issue. And further, that if I had some time with the car I could likely fix it for her for a few hundred in parts.

She buys a new car, gives up on the Maxima and sells it to me for $1200. Before I buy it, I tell her I am concerned that she will be mad if I fix it cheaply/easily. She says she is not concerned.

$300 (radiator, hoses, thermostat) and 2 hours later I have it back on the road.

Feeling guilty, I tell her that I think I have it fixed and tell her what I did/what it cost.

Her response? ""Good for you! Better you than some unscrupulous mechanic!""

Still feeling kinda guilty driving such a nice car that I got from such a nice lady/friend for $1500.

Should I feel guilty? Or is this just my overactive ""southern gentleman"" gene kicking in?"
4594	November 16, 2005 3:25AM	ghulet	You saved her $3300 on the new engine and $600 on the purchase, the car is nine years old and sounds like she wanted one anyway. You got a great deal, she's not angry (she would have no grounds to be anyway) and she has a new car. No harm, no foul.

4596	November 16, 2005 10:07AM	akangl	"I think the Dodge is trying to tell us something.......if I could only figure out what (maybe it wants to go back to the car lot??).

We had a mechanic look at Kermit (our skidder) and the Dodge promptly started having starting issues. Mechanic fixed it for $20 (battery cable issue). Had Kermit hauled out of the woods yesterday and down to the mechanic. Now the Dodge doesn't want to put out any heat......can't figure out what's going on with it. Is this a sign?? Is the Dodge jealous of Kermit?? LOL, those two darn things keep us in the poor house. :sick:

Hubby is talking about replacing the Dodge next year with an F-550. He's tired of the gas guzzling V10 and is paranoid with no warranty on a 7 year old truck.

Unfortunatly the Dodge isn't worth anything to a dealer, at least that's what they are telling us. Most of them say they don't want it (from a couple months ago when we looked). What to do with a regular cab 1999 Ram 3500 V10 with 42k miles on it?? Kind of a strange duck me thinks.

Argh.....just when I think we have the CCB habits licked! Least I'm happy with my 2.......3 more years and the Titan will be mine (after paying off the residual on the lease), Zippy should be paid off in that time as well."
4597	November 16, 2005 3:22PM	anonymousposts	"to fight off RL-itis. It was tough. We went up there with checkbook in hand but we couldn't come to terms in price. Besides, Gee wasn't too impressed with the light silver/tan interior RL that we took home overnight. They made one last ditch effort which might have worked. We still weren't positive we wanted it so we asked the salesman if we could take home the color combo we wanted overnight. He said sure so Gee drove up there only to find that the car that he went for was already sold. Good news is that the RL just came out so it will be available for years to come with better deals in the near future. He still needs to drive a manual IS250 as well.

What surprised us is how well our 04 Accord compared to the 05 RL. Sure the RL is nicer and AWD but either the RL is overpriced or the Accord is one darn nice car for the price.

Of course we still have the Lexus. We were going to sell it to Carmax for $5500 but decided that we could probably get more money for it by selling it private owner. It really is immaculate for the age and mileage. Terry in RWTIV said we could probably get $7500-$8000 selling it ourselves which would put $2000 more in our pocket."
4598	November 16, 2005 3:36PM	qbrozen	I think its both. The Accord is an incredible deal for what you get (i found it compared favorably with much more expensive vehicles), AND i think the RL is a tad overpriced for what you get (then again, i don't find many new $50k cars to be worth the money).
4599	November 16, 2005 3:39PM	qbrozen	"no guilt necessary.

Heck, I think she should be darned happy to get $1200 for a busted 160k mile ANYTHING."
4600	November 16, 2005 3:45PM	anonymousposts	We had gotten them down to $41,000 and they were giving us $16,500 for the Accord EX-L 5-speed which has 27,000 miles now. It was an OK deal but not great. The only RL's they had in the color Gee wanted were demos so the $41,000 was still a bit high IMO.
4601	November 16, 2005 3:50PM	qbrozen	"Was it $41k for the demo or for the new one in the wrong color?

'05 or '06? how many miles?"
4602	November 16, 2005 3:51PM	anonymousposts	Had they given us a price of $41,000 on a 0 mile RL we would've paid the $400 to have them trade with another dealer for the color Gee wanted. As it is, I was thinking $39,000 was fair.
4603	November 16, 2005 4:30PM	downhomeinga	"I appreciate the responses.

I think we both won on the Maxima deal - but I think she is pretty bitter at the mechanics whom misdiagnosed the issue.

But hey, you roll the dice and take your chances. And I tried to advise her to seek a second opinion.

As a separate question, does anyone feel guilt/angst in relation to their significant other for scratching their CCBA itch?

My wife is pretty understanding - she calls me a ""car slut"" - but the fleet keeps growing. There are only two of us (no kids) and now there are five cars.

Probably about time to trim the herd and sell off the mazda 626 I mentioned in post #4623. Just seems a shame as it will likely run and provide basic transport for quite a bit longer.

Thanks, Mike"
4604	November 16, 2005 5:20PM	woodyww	"That means it'd take 2 1/2 loaded 2 y.o. 6cyl. accords to trade for one demo RL.....seems like the Law of Diminishing Returns kicking in big time (to me).

I'm starting to think, with the mix of cars you guys have now, all leaning towards the practical or luxury side, why not get a ""fun"" car? Used Z4? Used E46 bmw convertible? New Mini? etc. Something in the low $20's where you could also keep the Accord? (i.e., how does a $40K RL really ""fit"" in your fleet full of Honda/Acura/Lexus products already)? I guess I'm just seconding the decision you made not to buy it....."
4605	November 16, 2005 6:45PM	michaellno	"downhomeinga - what's in the fleet? how long have you had each car? We've got a member here (andre) who has, I believe, 6 or 7 vehicles and there's only him. So, 5 cars with 2 drivers isn't too bad in comparison.

anon - i'm with woody on this. You've got the lexus and the accord (both sedans), the MDX (family hauler) and the Civic si (? - commuter). If you want to expand the fleet, get a used S2000, or, if you want to really spend that $40K, a used NSX. That ought to look good in the driveway."
4606	November 16, 2005 7:01PM	downhomeinga	"Yes, I have read of Andre's affliction. We have similar tastes in old Detroit iron. I still miss my 1978 Buick Regal (stolen and stripped many years ago).

My fleet is not that impressive in specifics - just in total #.

Here is the rundown:
1) 1973 VW Squareback Type III - Current Status: non-running project car - I've had it about 10 years (8 of those it has been garaged waiting for me to swap the engine).
2) 2002 PT Cruiser - Wife's daily driver - bought new - driven 30K miles a year - currently has about 110K miles & (knock on wood) no problems yet.
3) 2001 Mazda B3000 Pickup - My former daily driver and now the home project hauler - leased new and lease is almost up (current mileage 50K).
4) 1991 Mazda 626 - just a beater that i bought off a co-worker in non-running condition - using it as a parts getter and life when #2 or #3 are undergoing repairs. Current mileage 143K.
5) 1997 Nissan Maxima SE - bought of a co-worker two weeks ago - 162K miles but in very good condition/well maintained. This one will likely become my daily driver once I am sure it is reliable.

Now, what I need is a convertable. Maybe I can find a nice clean gen 1 Miata? Really like the looks of the new Solstice.

But I am an accountant - and therefore cheap - & the thought of the first year depreciation would keep me up nights!"
4607	November 16, 2005 7:16PM	phylp	"Yes, I am a chronic car buyer.

Our happy little family of two owns a 2004 Lexus RX330 with 50,000 miles, a 1998 Passat GLS V6 with 125,000 miles and a 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid that we gleefully purchased just two days ago. The Honda is now the baby of the family at 135 miles. I still mourn the trade of our 1999 Volvo S80 T6, but it was time for that one to leave the nest.

And, already, I am thinking ahead to the next ""new addition"", I mean car purchase . . .

So glad to have found this forum for us and others like us."
4608	November 16, 2005 7:34PM	andre1969	but I'm starting to get the urge again. And not the urge for another old mastodon, but for something newer. Right now I think the two new cars that intrigue me the most are the Charger (probably just a V-6, because I'm not in the mood to spend $30K plus for a car just yet) and the Ford Fusion, with a V-6.
4609	November 16, 2005 7:52PM	qbrozen	I'm just curious ... any reason why you traded the Volvo and kept the Passat?
4610	November 16, 2005 7:54PM	qbrozen	The Charger is supposedly a good deal of fun even with the V6 (latest autoweek). Have you driven both? I just think a FWD 220-hp V6 is outclassed by the competition these days.
4611	November 16, 2005 7:55PM	michaellno	"If you fit in the Fusion, you might really like it .. I had a quick drive in a V6 SE and was pleasantly surprised. Lots of equipment for $22-23K ... not sure what the Charger would run you with the 3.5.

You thinking of trading in the Intrepid?

downhome - so, the fleet will shrink when the Mazda goes back? Are there plans to replace it?

phylp - who drives what? Seems odd to have two sedans, but that's just my opinion."
4612	November 16, 2005 8:23PM	downhomeinga	"Will the fleet shrink when the truck goes back?

This is the subject of much arguing right now with the boss lady.

Again, Andre and my tastes are very similar - I am also tempted by the Charger V-6 and Fusion V-6. Might be getting a company paid car soon, and if I do it will likely be a Charger.

If I don't get a company car - well then the arguments with the wife will get more fervent. Would like to find an older little convert - miata, etc - cheap.

The roving eye is always looking for the next addition!"
4613	November 16, 2005 8:28PM	phylp	"Excellent question. Glad to answer.

The Volvo S80 was fast, comfortable, and safe, but there were some reliability issues -- especially with the emissions and the Chevrolet transmission. We traded the S80 for the Lexus RX330. So, we came away with ""comfortable, safe, and reliable"" but we lost ""fast."" That is why we kept the Passat -- to keep that quasi-sports car element: fast and smooth. There have been some mechanical issues with the Passat along the way, but nothing that affects the wonderful driving experience."

I had several problems with the Volvo S80 transmissions also (and traded it in on a RX330).

However, why would a Volvo have a Chevy transmission when they are owned by Ford?"
4615	November 16, 2005 8:53PM	andre1969	"I really think I'm daydreaming. I'm sure that once I actually start crunching some numbers on a Charger or Fusion (I think the type of Charger I want would only be around $22K or so, so it would be in range with the Fusion) I'd get cold feet.

I'm just too cheap, I guess! It's funny though, that 6 years ago I had no trouble paying over $20K out the door for that Intrepid, but today, even though I'm making more, have more saved up, and so on, but I balk at throwing around that kind of money for another new car.

It could also be that my needs have changed too, though. Back when I bought that Intrepid I had a part time job delivering pizzas, so it was very beneficial to have a reliable new car that got decent mileage. I also lived about 14 miles from my main job. Today though, I live 3 1/2 miles from work and only work the one job, so a reliable car that doesn't break down isn't quite as critical. I could walk to work if I had to.

Plus, I've also seen the benefits of being able to save money, put it in 401ks and Roths and such, so now I've got my sights on early retirement. That may just be a pipe dream too, but I'd rather see my retirement date get moved up a few years than get the instant, but fleeting satisfaction of a new car now.

Okay, I'll stop talking like that in the CCB forum, lest I get shot at! :shades:"
4616	November 16, 2005 9:12PM	phylp	"Well, for one thing, the S80 was developed before the Ford acquisition. The story was that Volvo needed a transmission that would fit under the hood with such a big engine, and the GM tranny fit. When I was shopping for the car in 1999, the salesmen would claim that the S80 had the same GM transmission that was in the Cadillac . . . but, I think it was actually the same as the one in the Corsica. Not sure what is under the hood of the recent models.

""Cars (and politics) make strange bedfellows."""
4617	November 16, 2005 9:22PM	qbrozen	Yeah, when i was looking at S80s, i was told by many people to buy an '02 or newer. Transmission was the #1 reason. But I've also heard alot of bad things about VWs, hence my question. But, of course, you made the choice that fit your experience best.
4618	November 16, 2005 10:36PM	stickguy	"as noted, the Charger with the 3.5, even with a sticker of 22K, got rave reviews recently. I just read it, so Autoweek sounds right (the latest issue).

As mentioned earlier, she will probably not have a car .. it's only a 1.5-2 hour drive from where we live, so on weekends we'll either

a) go up and visit, or
b) go up and bring her home

This means the Focus will almost certainly be sold next summer. I'll be happy to get what I owe on it, to be honest. What's funny is that I have this vision of selling the Focus to my ex-wife in SoCal for my son to drive - he turned 16 this past summer but doesn't yet have his permit. Mom said his grades had to get better in order for him to get his permit.

The money that would go for the car payment will now be the step-daughter's monthly living allowance; if she feels she needs more, she can always pick up a part time job."

The transmission occasionally shifts harshly even after a software update, and every few months, the electrical system will do something completely screwy, like refusing to open the fuel door, or the driver's door controls will cut out."

4629	November 17, 2005 1:48PM	gsemike	"I love cars and car shopping but don't you get killed on the sales tax hit everytime you buy a new one? My last car bought in 2003 was $20,300 so the sales tax was between $1700 and $1800. Some newer models have caught my eye, but the trade in on the current car is too low leaving my only option to sell privately and absorb another sales tax hit on the entire purchase price on the new car. I just can't go for that on a whim.

I started driving in 1985 and here is my list to the best of my recollection:
1973 Dodge Charger
1974 Olds Cutlass Salon
1970 Chevy Chevelle (my first nice car - $3,700)
1972 Buick LeSabre (first in a series of winter cars while the Chevelle was off the road)
1971 Pontiac LeMans
1973 Dodge Dart
1976 Chevy Nova
1978 Olds Cutlass Supreme
1980 Dodge Aspen
1981 Buick Regal
1985 Buick Regal (got the engine from the 81 after an accident)
1989 Camaro RS (5.0 but far too unreliable by 50k)
1989 Honda Accord LXi (5 speed - driven to imports after too many GMs)
1989 Honda Civic (my first new car bought on lease)
2003 Nissan Altima 2.5S (I own this one and am driving automatics again)

I just moved back to the burbs from Queens and am getting a 1993 Buick LeSabre for a second/station car. It feels good to be driving another 10 year old domestic s-box after all these years. As you can see, I've really slowed down as the purchase price of the cars has climbed."
4630	November 17, 2005 2:12PM	andre1969	"Sales tax must be killer in New York! I'd have to dig up the paperwork to be sure, but I think the sales tax on my Intrepid, which ended up being around $22,400 out the door, was around $1,000. I vaguely rmember the paperwork stating the sales price was $19,986, including freight but not including tax, title, registration, and the extended warranty, etc. We pay 5% tax, so I think it came out to around $1K. Not as bad as $1700-1800, but geeze, that's about the price I've paid for many of my cars!

When you trade a car, don't they base the sales tax on the difference? For instance, if I pay $22K for a new Charger, and they give me $4K for my Intrepid, wouldn't I just pay the sales tax on the $18K difference, rather than the whole $22K?

Another nice thing about an old beater is that you don't care as much when something happens to it. While my Intrepid isn't a beater yet, at least it's at the point where it's paid for, and I'm not going to fret over every little dent, ding, and stone chip like I would have when it was new. I still remember the first dent I put on the car (my fault) and I was PISSED!! And I don't want to have to deal with that all over again with my hypothetical new Charger or Fusion."
4631	November 17, 2005 2:45PM	gsemike	"I think that the tax rate here in NY is about 8.5%. It definately is high. In that above list, there have been many cars where the purchase price was less than the tax on the last car. If memory serves, I think I paid $50 or $100 for the Nova.

If I traded my car in, I would just pay sales tax on the difference but with the lower value, I don't think that it's worth it. I looked at an Acura TSX not too seriously and they mentioned $9000 as a ballpark trade in. I think that the private retail would be around $12000 and dealer list my car as high as the 14s. Even though I'd save on the taxes, I don't think it's worth it.

Regarding the Buick, having a second car is a luxury. It will be nice to have but I'm only 3/4 mile from the train. We got the car for free and it only cost about $300 to insure it. I figured that we'll take it 6 months at a time and as soon as it become more trouble than it's worth, it's gone. The car has about 115k with the tranny rebuilt at 90k. I hope to get a couple of years out of it.

On a final note, the sales tax isn't the only tax that bring on the ouch-ful feeling. I'll rail about this on the Kiplinger message boards, but the property and income taxes are a burden as well."

I remember reading that the trans. in the S80 was some kind of convoluted, Rube Goldberg set-up because of the layout of the engine, etc.
4634	November 17, 2005 3:48PM	andre1969	"but I heard that the GM tranny used in BMWs was a unique one actually built to BMW specs, as opposed to being an existing domestic tranny that just got outsourced.

GM has supplied automatic trannies to other makers for ages, probably because GM invented the automatic tranny and pretty much got it right from the get-go. They used to sell them to Lincoln, and I think Nashes used GM automatics for awhile, too. And in the 60's, Rolls Royce used GM automatics."
4635	November 17, 2005 3:52PM	woodyww	"A few years ago, when I bought my used '98 Range Rover for $36K I paid $2100 in sales tax--not fun (& just the start of expenses for that vehicle, of course). I did get about 2/3 of the sales tax ""back"" when I traded the RR a year later for $28K--helped ease the pain a bit."
4636	November 17, 2005 3:55PM	stickguy	"actaully, I think the tranny sort of hangs off the side and gets run by a chain. The I6 is too long to fit transversly with the tranny on the end as is the norm.

Not really sure if that adds to the problems though, but it does explain the ""Rube Goldberg"" reference."
4637	November 17, 2005 4:03PM	woodyww	"That is probably true. The other maker of bmw auto trans. is ZF; I never can remember which is the more reliable. Not even sure which one I have in my E-39 5 series as they changed trans. I believe in the year my car was mfg.

I am really interested in that Toyota Corona I forgot what kind of engine was in it and was it a bigger car than the now corrola, camry? I think those late 80s early 90s, Benz's were good choices, and it looks like you favor the Toyota line of cars know and you can be almost considered an expert because you have owned and driven.

How in the world do you still have your license, if you know that the Civic will do 132, the Accord 125 and the Odyssey (!) 120MPH.

The fastest I've had my L300 to is ~100MPH, and that was on a deserted stretch of US 285 in the middle of Colorado - downhill and downwind, no less. Where in Georgia do you find the room to go that fast?

Andre - trust me, I get the same feelings regarding a new car. I've been a car nut for as long as I can remember, but I've never enjoyed the income to really feed my addiction. Now that I'm at a point in my life where I could concievably afford something fun, my mature side comes out and says stuff like you're hearing - retirement, etc.

Trying to balance the immediate gratification side of me (see Editor Karl's discourse on this topic and the purchase of his Ford GT) and the rational side can be a bit of a struggle."

I was doing around 110 mph by the end of the ramp and it was still accelerating really hard, and I had already started wondering what all that horsepower is good for on public roads. I don't think I've hit 90 mph since that first day.

We have an Odyssey, but I doubt I've ever hit 85 mph in it. I truly hate to drive that thing. It is a perfectly nice vehicle, but I hate it. The only reason I would take it up to 120 mph is to get out of it faster, but I only drive it if the whole family is with me, so I can't really do that."

4647	November 18, 2005 2:03AM	corvette	"I would NOT pay nearly $40k for that vehicle which offers little more than an Impala at twice the price.

It was one of those ""the devil I know"" things, plus it was one of those cars where the test drive was nice, but long-term ownership leaves something to be desired. She cross-shopped the old model TL, the G35, MDX, ES330 and old RX300. Of those, the TL, G35, and MDX (sorry, Anon and Gee) did not have very nice interiors. The new TL seems to have rectified that problem, but now has way too much horsepower for a FWD car. No one in our immediate family will ever own a VW/Audi/Porsche product again due to very bad past experiences, most of which are documented here on Edmunds. Mom likes BMWs, but she also hates computers, and I don't think the momentary-contact turn signal and wiper controls on the new models (or mandatory iDrive on the 5-series) would suit her at all, so, I don't know what she'll get next. When I drove the G35, I thought to myself that it would be the perfect car for her if it had a nicer interior. If she keeps the S80 past four years, it will most likely get the Volvo extended warranty.

Compared to the Impala, the S80 is more refined in every way, but probably has less interior room. And, it has more snob appeal--if I were a member of a country club, I'd feel better about pulling up in it than an Impala (this is one of the reasons one of my friends is dying to buy a used 2001 Mercedes C-class with 90,000 miles).

Dad is completely hopeless with the Beetle; he will just keep sinking money into it for the time being. It has new glowplugs and wires now. He may quit the job that requires such a long commute, which makes him reluctant to buy a new fuel miser car."

4649	November 18, 2005 3:02PM	andre1969	"but I prefer the Volvo to the Acura interior. I don't have a problem with either one, but I like the more linear, connected look of the Volvo. Like the way the little wood strip comes cleanly across, and how the shroud over the gauges carries over to the central HVAC ducts, or the nice, integrated sweep of the center console as it blends into the dash.

Color might have something to do wtih it, too. I like the lighter eggshell/ecru/whatever you want to call it of the Volvo better than the light beige/brown of the Acura."
4650	November 18, 2005 3:41PM	qbrozen	"In addition to andre's comments (which i wholeheartedly agree with) also notice how the center console in the volvo is angled toward the driver.

Everything seems to wrap around the driver, as opposed to the more minivan-like straight-up arrangement in the Acura."
4651	November 18, 2005 4:07PM	gsemike	They both look very nice, but the wood in the Volvo looks richer and it also has a nice wood insert in the shifter knob and chrome trim around the guages. The downside in the Volvo is that it looks like the whatever those bottom controls are, they would be hard to get to when in Park.

It worked out well for them as they didn't have the hassle of a car on campus (parking, etc) and their parents didn't have to take time off to come get them. For me, it made the drive easier and they often split the cost of gas which was nice.

That was one fun car to drive but it rode like a go-cart. Traded it for an '84 Golf to escape the unbelievable torque steer (when pushing the car) and punishing ride. In '85 or '86 they gentrified the GTI so I, naturally, had to have one of those.
Let's see, that makes 41 cars in since 1970. I think the American Automobile Dealers Assoc. oughta give me a free one when I turn 60 in three years as justifiable premium. I've done my part to keep the new car business in the black.

as for sales tax. . . . in TX you pay tax on the difference. In the early days it was probably 3-4%. Lately, it's 6.5%. If you trade an almost new one for a brand new one, the tax is a bite but not terrible. Come to think of it, The State of Texas could kick some money in on my free car from the AADA. The governor has made some good money on my chronic bad habits (just like they do on cigarettes.)"
4667	November 19, 2005 5:30PM	mark156	"Hi folks, I've been ""car looking"" for several weeks and will probably buy in early December. This is what I have been researching:

2006 Land Rover LR3 HSE
2006 Volvo XC90 V8 AWD
2006 Volvo V70 wagon
2006 Jeep Commander Limited (5.7 HEMI)
2006 Cadillac SRX V8
2006 Mercedes R500

So far, my conclusion is that the Land Rover has moved to the top where it was at the bottom a week ago. My requirements are that the vehicle must seat 6 or more people, have adequate power, AWD or 4x4 and have full sun visors that adjust once you move them to the side.

Note: I have not driven any of these vehicles yet.

My conclusion:
*The Land Rover appears to have the most room inside, does not have adjustable sun visors but they are very large and it might work with a slight adjustment in the seat to keep the sun from hitting the side of your face. One complaint was that the dash looked very ""plasticy"" but Land Rover offers a wood kit for the dash that looked quite attractive. The third seat will fit a 6'2"" person comfortably.

*All Volvo's have Non-Adjusting short sun visors. The headrests in the XC90 are not comfortable. (The plus)The third seats fold completely flat and I like the split flip gate and small tail gate configuration like the Land Rover.

*The Volvo wagon's third seat is ONLY for small children so this one is not in the running.

*The Jeep Commander was at the top of the list but now I don't care for the third seat set-up where the floor is raised 3 inches to accomodate the folding seats. Also, I don't care for the 'bolt screws' that are apparent all over the vehicle, on the dash, in the headlight assembly's and around the fender wheel-wells. I like to wash my vehicles myself and I keep thinking I'm going to have to keep a supply of Q-tips handy for cleaning the crevices. Also, for such a large vehicle, the second and third row are rather tight. The front passenger seat is only a 4-way power adjust (the bottom of the seat does not move up and down). For a $44,000 vehicle it should have 8-way power seats.

* The Cadillac SRX is a nicely done vehicle. The sun visors don't fully adjust and are short. Third seat is a little small.

*The Mercedes R500 is nice but too ""mini-vanish"" for me and it's $15,000 more than the Land Rover and will seat only 6 vs 7 for the LR3.

These are basically visual and personal observations on how the vehicle will fit my needs. I know that the performance will vary some with each drivetrain/engine size. They all basically get the same fuel mileage which is about 14-15 in the city and 18-20 on the highway.

4668	November 19, 2005 5:43PM	mark156	"Andre, it would be interesting to see how much one ""condo garage"" would cost. I'm going to guess the largest unit with 1152 sq. ft. would run about $60,000 to $70,000. I'm sure that would depend on the location of the country where it's located. Plus, you would have a small maintenance fee and electricity charge. Not a bad idea if you ask me.

4669	November 19, 2005 6:07PM	woodyww	Oh, boy.....Are resale value, &/or reliability, on your list of criteria anywhere? To start, 1. nix any LR if you want to keep your wallet, & sanity intact (I understand the LR obsession tho). 2. A first year, brand new model of a M-B????? M-B reliability has been poor for at least 5-7 years. 3. $44K for a Jeep???? What? 4. Despite all the negative comments about S80 reliability here lately, I suppose, out of that bunch, I might go for the V70 wagon. 5. Is any Japanese vehicle on your list? MDX? Sequoia? A Lexus SUV? For that kind of money, I'd be thinking, Lexus, or Acura......just my 2 cents.
4670	November 19, 2005 8:40PM	corvette	Those are way bigger than your typical storage unit, but metal buildings are relatively cheap to build. I think a freestanding 16 x 40 metal building is about $10,000 (for the building alone). Wouldn't the price per square foot stay about the same for a larger building?
4671	November 19, 2005 8:42PM	corvette	"...nix any LR if you want to keep your wallet, & sanity intact...

They were running some subsidized lease deals not long ago. That way, he would only lose his sanity..."
4672	November 19, 2005 9:15PM	andre1969	"I'm guessing that the price per square foot would actually go down as you go to larger buildings. For instance, a building that's double the square footage isn't going to take twice as much labor or twice as much total materials. You'd have twice as much roof and twice as much floor, but the wall area wouldn't increase all that much.

Using my garage as an example, originally I spec'd a 30x40 gambrel barn with a full loft, and staircase going up to it. I was quoted $22,000, although the only site prep that included was drilling holes for the poles. Leveling, filling in, and the concrete slab was on my dime.

Well, going to the smaller 24x40 building, and losing the second level, dropped the price to around $15,000. Which IMO is still pretty cheap, but that 30x40 foot gambrel barn really seemed like a deal for the money. I just wish the county hadn't put their foot down on it."

I always rag on my local dealer, who has a great service department, and really nice salespeople, but just can't believe that you want to bargain for less money... but, this time, I gave them a price, and they countered $200 higher and I took it..

MSRP $49,345.. 3yr/45K lease for $499/mo. + tax.. $1200 due at signing... $529/mo. with tax included..

I can't take too much credit.. The lease program is very good right now, and there is a $2000 dealer incentive..

The really surprising part... I asked for trade-in number on my wife's car.. Independent of the lease deal.. I was trying to be realistic, but expecting the worst...but, it was actually a reasonable number.. I'm picking the car up Friday, and they told me their offer for my trade was good until then... I started making some calls when I left the dealership, and I think I've got it sold for $1200 more than their offer..

So, it was a very good day..

I call it the semi-bobst method of buying a car... I really was going to leave, if I didn't get my deal.. But, they blurted out that $200 before I could get out the door... and they had home-made cookies in the showroom..

Dang!! I forgot to ask about the extra set of keys!!"

4687	November 20, 2005 2:48PM	brightness04	Congrats on the great deal! Nowadays to get a car like that, one almost has to go through lease due to the lease-subsidies. For whatever reason, one just can't that much off MSRP through a purchase. A $500/mo lease payment should roughly translate into a $38k car not a $50k car; congrats on the deal. On the other hand, state excise tax often goes by MSRP; a $50k MSRP translates to over $1000 for the first year! and close to $700 for the second, and $400 for the third. That $500 or so extra tax bill over three years could have gone to BMW instead of the town tax collector if only BMW had put forward a more realistic MSRP to begin with. Good news for buyers at the tail end of a model year though: you are only liable for a fraction of the first year's monsterous tax bite. Double Congrats!

Right now, I have about 7500 miles. There are no major problems to report. Minor ones include a radio that won't turn on with the key out (it just flashes the screen for a second and shuts off). I would have gotten Comfort Access, were it available when my car was produced.

It's everything I want in a daily driver, and I really enjoy driving it. The acceleration is good, the ride is firm but not jarring, and the handling is amazing. Keeping up with traffic in town entails shifting at around 2000 rpm, so I barely hear the engine.

Are you already planning on replacing the 330Ci with an E92 in a couple of years?"
4689	November 20, 2005 9:53PM	woodyww	"I can't argue with someone who owns 5 Mercedes....I've almost bought a few myself (one at a time) over the years. I just wish they still had that reputation of going 200K miles w/o major problems.

I also (sort of) like corvette's idea, even if it was in jest, about leasing a LR if the lease rates are great. Esp. if you have 5 other cars that always run. And if you live near a LR dealer with a great service dept. I would never have sold my Range Rover if I didn't have to be concerned about the practicality & $$ spent...."

If I *had* to have a new car and wasn't a MB addict, I would consider that car. I do like it a lot more than the last one, and that 306hp engine is interesting, just pricey. For now, I am still happy as a clam with my C43, and it's halfway paid for already."

Also, I would not keep a Mercedes over 100,000 miles... Since there are two drivers and six cars in the household... the miles don't pile up very fast. One of the Mercedes is 15 years old and just turned 50,000 last week. The years of the Mercedes are ( 1990, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002).

I was only halfway kidding. If you want a car that depreciates quickly, and they offer a subsidized lease (Saab and Land Rover come to mind), that's the way to go.

Speaking of major problems, when I talked to my dad the other day, he told me that the dash lights on his Beetle are lit up like a Christmas tree again, so we'll have at least one father-son project to work on over Thanksgiving."

Actually, the 15 y.o. bmw was a lot more reliable than the 2.5 y.o. RR. The LR dealer service was very good overall; most of the LR dealers treat you quite well. But driving around w/o a working stereo for 2 of the 12 months I had it, taking it in for one repair, & leaving with something else suddenly not working, getting 10.8 mpg city & 15 hwy, little things like that started to grate.

So the combination of a 15 y.o. bmw that needed $3-$4K in suspension & brake work (thru no fault of the car, just age), & a LR with the warranty running out, proved to have some drawbacks.....but, I digress."

I know, pretty scary eh?? :blush: Let's see, we've had the Titan for 1 year 9 days, Zippy for 16 months (today in fact), and the Dodge for TWO years 9 days. Me thinks we are doing pretty good.

Zippy will turn 50k tomorrow or the next day, the Titan just turned 26k, and the Dodge (a 1999) has a whopping 42k on it.

I still grin when I get behind the wheel of the Titan, for the past 11k miles its been a great truck (last repair was the brakes at 15k). Sometimes I think I'd be better off with a 1-ton, but I can't bring myself to part with the Titan. And Zippy, well, she's just Zippy, still love to drive her, but find myself drifting to the Titan a lot more now that the commute isn't as long.

Hubby's getting a little cranky about the Dodge, so I see a replacement coming in the next year.......probably an F-550 or a Kodiak C-5500."

Turns out the best I have ever done was 63k on a 2000 Explorer over three years. I felt pretty good about that and thought I was reformed until i just had to try the German car thing(Jetta 1.8t).

I just wanted to ask what some of the other CCBA's maximum mileage would be ? I am betting not one true junkie has gone over 100k."

If you add the mileage up on all three Accords the total would be 64,000 miles. However, the in that same amount of time we have always had at least 2-3 other cars in the driveway. Since September of 2003 our total mileage, exluding the Spider Condo, totals 103,000 miles or just over 50,000 miles per year.

My ""extra"" car is the wife's mini-van. Hardly sporty , and usually when I drive it there are the five of us in it. I feel like Ralph Cramden driving the big bus. I am sure the van will stay until 100k, but I don't really consider it mine. She gets to make the decision on that one.

That said I really think I can make 100k with my car(I think I can, I think I can said the little train)."

Now hubby has put 151k on a truck (his 1988 F-150) in 9 1/2 years.

If I added up the mileage from all the cars I've had over the past 13 years I bet its closing in on 500k. I seem to average between 30k (low year) to 50k per year.

Only 5 speeding tickets in that time too. October 19, 1994 76 in a 65 ($44), June 20, 1995 70 in a 65 (dismissed in court), July 4, 1998 80 in a 65 (written up as 74 in a 65)($46), February 28, 2001 83 in a 65 ($82), and finally my most recent one was October 21, 2005 67 in a 55 (written up as 64 in a 55)($82).

4711	November 22, 2005 4:23PM	bumpy	I put just over 100k in seven years on my '88 Sentra (which had over 190k already when I bought it), and I put about 35k on the '00 Accent in the three years I've had that. On the other hand, the '91 Isuzu picked up only 12k in five years (and most of that in the first two years I had it) and only 3k on the '92 SE-R I bought last year.
4712	November 22, 2005 4:49PM	andre1969	I added up all the miles I put on cars since I got my first car in February 1987. Comes out to around 375,000 miles. Funny, I thought it would be more by now, especially after all those years of delivering pizzas. I guess the early years though, like high school and college where I attended locally, and then the few years I lived 3 1/2 miles from work before moving away (and then moving back 2 years ago) helped to cancel out those pizza delivery days.

He has recently bought a new 2005 Mercury Mountaineer and realized he can't stand the vehicle which now only has 2,700 miles and 8 months of ownership. I don't think he'll keep it very long.

I've got to get him to this site because he just sold a 2003 Mustang convertible that he bought with 9,000 miles and re sold it a year later with 14,000 miles for the exact same money he bought it for. He likes the ""deal"", the car itself is unimportant.

I sure wish I knew how to take pictures and put them on this site. I would like to show you folks my antique.

4716	November 22, 2005 5:46PM	michaellno	"375K in 18 years? That's about 21K per year.

I don't think I could figure out how many miles I've driven, given that I travelled about 2 weeks per month on business for approximately 15 years, mostly with rental cars.

Now, on the vehicles that I owned personally ... hmmm, let's see:

'79 Pontiac Sunbird - bought with 12K on it in the spring of '82; totalled in the summer of '85 with, I think, 65K = 53K

'77 Olds Omega - kept for only a few months between the Sunbird and graduation - maybe 2K in that time

'85 Honda Accord LX - bought with 16K, drove it until '88 and traded it in with 55K = 39K

'86 Isusu P'up and '88 Isuzu Trooper - switched back and forth between these two during my first marriage. Both bought new. Sold both within 6 weeks of one another. P'up had, I think, 40K on it; Trooper had about the same. If I'm responsible for 1/2 the mileage on each, then that's 40K.

'91 Nissan Sentra SE - bought new. Drove it for 2 1/2 years and 35K - moved to CO with this car.

'93 Honda Accord DX - leased for 66 months (don't comment!) - spent most of its time in the airport parking lot. Turned in at end of lease with 58K on it.

Then it gets tricky, as I have had many cars since the Accord where I was not the only driver.

'98 Ford Expedition - leased new; traded in before lease end with 38K. I'll claim half of the miles (19K)

'99 VW New Beetle - leased new; bought at end of lease. Traded in with 70K, but the last 15K were done by step son. Again, I'll take credit for half of the 55K (27K)

'02 Ford Explorer - leased new; traded in before lease end with 33K - my half would be 17K

'03 Saturn L300 - bought new; I put 39K on it in 2 years before it became my step-daughter's daily driver - now has 44K

'03 Ford Focus - bought new; I started to use it as my daily driver with 12K on it. Now has 34K. So, 22K of it is mine.

So, roughly 351K in 23 years - just over 15K per year.

Again, if I add it all the rental car miles I drove, that would probably add on, hmmm ...

Figure I travelled about 20 weeks per year for 15 years (350 weeks). Some weeks I would only put on a couple hundred miles; other weeks, I would drive several hundred miles to visit family and friends that were over and above the back and forth I would do. Figure an average of 400 miles per week. So, that's another 140K that I've driven.

That puts me close to a half million miles (351K + 140K)

Sheesh - that sounds like a lot when you total it all up.

Should there be a Chronic Car Drivers Anonymous?"

Of course, the big danger with tagging a future allocation car is that by the time it arrives, 3 or 4 other cars will catch my eye!

The low mileage made me feel like I really wasted my money on a lease. With my current car, an 03 Altima, I've covered 32k in 33 months. I've done a little more driving for work.

I just moved out to Long Island so I guess I'll get back up to 12k a year, but my drive to the train is only 3/4 of a mile. We picked up a 1993 LeSabre for a beater car. It runs decent for 115k but it feels weird to be driving an old barge like that. No that it's getting cold, I never realized how much I could miss a temperature guage! That car needs to be warmed up alot more than the Alt."
4727	November 23, 2005 4:26PM	andre1969	"Mike, that pic was actually taken on top of the hill at Carlisle. I guess it does look kinda like a junkyard in that pic, though! There was another '77 Electra there as well, also around $2000. While it doesn't look bad in this pic, it didn't look nearly as nice in person, and the interior was a bit ratted out. Shame, because I really like the color on this one. This one was a Limited, with the nice, over-stuffed interior.

And just for comparison, here's a 1976 Electra that was at Spring Carlisle. I REALLY love this style and color (although the light metallic blue is nicer), but the seller wanted $4500 for this particular example, and it was a bit rough around the edges."
4728	November 23, 2005 5:57PM	jjtj	"OK Andre, you wanted to be talked out of it.. here goes - I can get into some of the slightly older 70's cars, say pre 1977 (for the most part), but that body style you're considering, I never cared for. To me, it doesn't really have any ""style"" to it.. Although the 2-door version is pretty nice. Now the older Buick you have pictured, is a different story. That shows the excess of the time.

OTOH, anything in decent shape for ~$1800 can't be too much of a gamble.."
4729	November 23, 2005 7:41PM	gsemike	"Maybe you'd like the beater LeSabre I just picked up even though it's a front driver. I don't particularly care for it but if it's free, it's me.

It's a white 4 door. It's got no rust and just minor dings. Put two hubcaps on it and repaint the roof which has peeled and it would actually be in very good shape for the age. It has a medium blue interior with no tears and the headliner is like new which I think is unusual but that problem could have been straightened out by 93. Besides the front arm rest which flops all the way to the back seat, the interior is good but the ergonomics is not what I'm used to. It's got column shift and the HVAC is a series of small chrome buttons. It's got Dynaride whatever that is and the power antena still works.

Hopefully it lasts until the Alt is paid for."
4730	November 24, 2005 12:08AM	woodyww	"Thinking of selling my 6 y.o. bmw 5-series wagon (Touring) with only 24K miles(!) & buying a used MDX, or used or new current-gen 4Runner. Reasons: well.....anything I can think of. The bmw has been a great car, superb road car, almost no problems. Altho the CPO warranty has run out, & today the remote locks started acting flakey, altho it could be that both keys need new batteries(?). And in black, no SPP, the E-39 can look a bit boring IMO. Oh, & I'm sick of having to deal with snow tire changeovers on a RWD car; as usual my snows aren't on yet at Thanksgiving. (At least on AWD or FWD cars, even if snows are optimal, you can sort of get by without if need be).

Problem is, the bmw might only be worth $18K now, even if I sold it privately. And I know no SUV will give me the same handling, or gas mileage, altho AWD & ground clearance would be a big plus in Mass. winters. And, just paying an extra $10K over what I could get for my car would be a fairly big deal for me, altho do-able.

I've also considered mini-utes like the Forester or CRV, but I'm in a Toyota or Acura mood right now, & something more ""hunky"" would probably do it for me more. Any advice? Keep the car? Sell it? Move to Arizona? TIA!"

It only cost us less than $13,000 out the door, and maintenance is more like $39 every 6 months, cuz it only travels 10,000 a year. We plant to sell it at 57 months old, that way we can say there still is 50K left on the power train warranty,(or 90 days) The car is fun to drive and fearless & generic in the parking lot. I got a 2004 Jeep that I plan to drive 15 years (150K) and a 2004 Pilot we plan for 8 years (90K). Hopefully after the Focus I can join chronic buyers again temporarily

4734	November 24, 2005 6:52AM	corvette	The E46 keys (at least on the newer ones) didn't have replaceable batteries in the keyfob, they charged inductively as you drove the car. I thought the E39 used the same key?
4735	November 24, 2005 5:28PM	woodyww	From searching the E39 board (on another site) it looks like you're right. Apparently the keys can go bad after a few years, & cost well over $100 each. Or--one guy was saying it could be the antenna (for the receiving of signal from the key)?? Or the general module? Whatever it is, it failed exactly 2 weeks after the CPO warranty ran out.

The new 2007 full size GM SUV's (Yukon, Tahoe) look really nice with completely re-done interiors. The new Escalade wasn't there but I can see they are all similar from the GM website.

Looks like the Land Rover LR3 is still at the top of my list out of the Volvo XC90 and the Jeep Commander. The third seat is really roomy in the LR3 in comparison to the others. In about another week, I'll be able to test drive my choices and hopefully will come to a conclusion.

Two ways I have avoided that my entire life. (1) Pay cash. (2) Stay away from Ford, GM and Chrysler.

I see you have a Honda Pilot. My Honda S2000 was the best sub $75k car I've ever owned for driving enjoyment, fit and finish, zero problems and 3 year resale value. Consider it (or it's equivalent in 2008) before you throw money at a Mustang. Just a friendly suggestion."
4741	November 26, 2005 7:30PM	anonymousposts	It depends on the car. I know when we first saw this MDX we did a lot of shopping and lower mileage versions were a $5000-$8000 premium for the same year with similar options. Sure we could've paid more and gotten one with 10,000-20,000 less miles but at the rate we drive we would've been out of warranty in less than a year anyways. We are fairly confident in Acura/Honda reliability although there are exceptions with any make/model you may choose.
4742	November 27, 2005 5:44PM	woodyww	"Yeah, saving $5000-$8000 means a lot. And I see your logic as you're buying a reliable make anyway. I've been ""on-line shopping"" for a current-gen 4Runner--the asking prices are just all over the map. You'd probably have to get one with 50K more miles than another to save $5K. Could be worth it with a Toyota? I dunno, I'm thinking, for myself, one with 10-20K miles, & even Certified, gotta love that 7 year (I think) CPO warranty. Not sure why I'm suddenly leaning to a 4Runner vs. an MDX--well, they're less expensive used, & maybe I want to more fully satisfy my ""truck gene"".

4743	November 28, 2005 4:32AM	durability05	I plan on keeping the Pilot EXL until 2011, I will take a chance on its fragile automatic transmission, hopefully it is not like the old Odyssey which ate up transmissions like a Dodge Caravan. The wrangler is an original American iron, everytime I am on the freeway the only old vehicles I see are Jeeps, Toyotas and Fords (Fords are however mostly found on the road dead, no kidding, at least they still found their way to the freeway. This is my observation on Southern CA. freeways, I did not find any Honda's more than 15 years old on the freeway?
4744	November 28, 2005 4:34AM	nippononly	"I have one! For some reason, and in a major departure from my usual pattern, I managed 5 1/2 years and 115K miles in my '97 Sube Outback Sport, before the itch just got too strong. And I had more than one car the entire time I had it too, so it wasn't just because it was suddenly my only mode of transport. I have looked back over the years since, and more than once have wished I could have it back. It was a local buyer, and I still see her sometimes, years later. It is a lot dirtier now, but seems to be going just fine.

So anyway, in a torrent (no pun intended) of dozens and dozens of vehicles over the years, I did manage to get over that 100K threshold exactly ONCE! :-P

gee: LOVE that pic of the Lexus! Wow, does it look good for its age. Are those Lexus rims or aftermarket?"
4745	November 29, 2005 4:03PM	qbrozen	"$18k? Really? I don't think I've ever seen a 5-series with those miles for that kind of money. I'm guessing its a 525 with few options? automatic?

Heck, if I found a 530 manual trans with those miles at that price, I might even be tempted to cross to what I've considered the dark side (bimmers).

Then again... 6 years old is 6 years old.

Anyway ... would the car be that bad with a GOOD set of all-seasons that are rated very well in the snow?"
4746	November 29, 2005 6:25PM	woodyww	"It's a 2000 528i wagon (Touring), auto, Premium, lthr, S/R, CD changer, 24K miles. A year ago Terry quoted me $19K as trade-in, & a few months ago I saw one similar to mine, super low miles, go for $19--something on e-bay. It does seem kind of ridiculous that such a nice low-mileage car should go for so little. It's probably such a good buy that I shouldn't sell it. Supposedly the E39 5-series are pretty reliable (esp. with the I-6), & IMO a lot more reliable than other current gen. German makes. (Knock wood)

I have a new set of Dunlop WinterSport M3'sin the garage, just need to have them installed. The car is quite decent with good snows & the traction control; I had a set of Michelin snows that were pretty good but sold them to get the Dunlops.

It might take $10K difference, roughly, if I sold the bmw privately, to get say an '04 MDX touring with low miles (& probably have to buy it privately to get a good price on one).

Is it worth it? I dunno. The MDX has a 4 yr. warranty (I think), so I'd get maybe 2 yrs. warranty with an '04. I could also try to rationalize it with the resale value of Acuras, the AWD, the extra ground clearance & visibility with an SUV.

Then again, I know I'm just jones-ing for a new automotive ""fix"". And I'm partly just bored with the way the E39 wagons look in black, & sick of black cars in general. If you want a 530i stick, make sure to get one with the Sport Package--mine doesn't have it, & that's always bugged me. And try to get one with Xenons--it costs a ton to retro-fit them......

Drove a (used 2005) Legacy 5 speed today to see how I liked it. Was OK, but wasn't quite as exciting as I expected. Plus, it felt a little cramped in the front seat. Not as nice with the cloth as my friends leather lined Limited, plus the AT actually seemed to suit the car better. Too bad I will likely be getting a killer offer on the incoming unit I have my name attached to...

But, as often proven, it's not a good idea for me to buy anything because it is cheap, or that I have to rationalize my way into. My past is full of ""it seemed like a good idea at the time"" deals.

Big problem is (somebody needs to slap me, or give me a push) is I also stopped at the VW dealer (a little voice told me too). Sat in and played with (but did not drive) a new Jetta 2.0T 6 speed manual. Damn, this is a nice, loaded car. COmfy, and fit me like a glove. Plus, I know how nice the drivetrain is from testing an Audi A3.

The Jetta is very roomy for the driver, surprisingly good in the back seat, and has a huge trunk. Fun to drive, quick, good MPG, and top safety scores.

Oh, and its a (VW)*cough*

I should learn by now that I am happier with something that I like, even if it isn't considered to be the most reliable ride in the world. And it does have a 4 year BTB and 5 year powertrain warranty, so at least it wouldn't cost me anything for a while.

I have to go back and drive it, but it fells real good, and isn't rediculously expensive for what you get. And it has great seats.

Yeah, an Accord makes more sense, or maybe a TSX for a couple K more, but I really like the Jetta.

The only downside is you may have to become good friends with Otto the mechanic and the down time.I don't know if most VW dealers give out loaners or not. Something you might want to check into.

I had a Jetta 1.8t a few years back. My biggest complaint(aside from my wife refusing to learn how to drive a stick) was the small back seat. From what I have read the 2006 has taken care of that.

My favorites were the turbo and the cool blue dash lights."

The only thing that saved me on the Passat was that I bought a slightly used one & saved $6000, so I lost almost nothing when I traded it in.

Heck, I'd buy a used BMW 3-series in a heartbeat, before a new VW. If you want great seats, handling, etc. it's the ""real deal"". Just my 2 cents."

Actually, if I buy something nice, I plan to keep it for a while. College starts in 3.5 years, which will but the kibash on new cars.

The VW dealer isn't too far away. No, zi don't want to become a regular, but if it has to go in once in a while, not a big deal. I actually have taken my Scion back more times than any other new car I ever had, except for out 1996 Voyager.

My problems usually come when I settle for less than I want, so I get the urge too soon.

I also have had good luck with other ""problematic"" cars. I had a '95 Mystique (bought in '98, kept 3 years) that gave me no trouble, other than a spark plug wire that went bad.

I could lease, or, if it turns out to be a dog, take the bath and move it.

It is a very nice comfy car though. And I would certainly accept a few foibles to have a car I loved driving, instead of hating every minute driving a boring appliance like a Camry (no offense intended to the happy Camry owner!)

The reviews on the 2.0T model seem to give it glowing praise at least. And it has nice seats.

I plan to shoot down and drive one tomorrow at lunch. It was too late last night to drive an unprepped car.

I expect that the $$ figure difference might be too big, but if they really want to drop the old shorts to make a year end deal, who am I to argue."

After dealing with every VW dealer in Kentucky except one, and having had two late-model VWs in my family, I have some beefs about their mechanical quality and dealer sales and service practices. It's too soon to have any meaningful information on the reliability of the fifth-generation Jetta--we'll have a better idea in a couple of years.

I've also gotten myself so worked up by test driving so many different vehicles, that I ""refused to settle"", at all, & that's how I once convinced myself to buy a Range Rover, & ignore all the poor reliability ratings, to my chagrin. The RR was so gorgeous tho that it ""was almost worth it"".....but I took a fairly serious bath owning it for one year.

Are there any killer subsidized lease rates on VW's? Or could you save a lot by buying a 1-2 y.o. one? And to each his own, but I find it hard to believe that a VW is the only vehicle that could possibly ""do it for you"".....even tho it seems like it right now in the heat of car shopping......

4769	December 1, 2005 7:21PM	stickguy	"we at least have some good dealers here. Plus I get to look at the Porsches while I am there.

The 2.0T as I would get it is just about 26K even MSRP, and 24K invoice, so I would expect to pay the 24 or less. So, at least a few grand below a TSX, and much less than a 3 series or a TL. An A3 would be 30K with my minimum requirements.

so, getting into the 23-24K range is a tough area to decide. Not real expensive (3 series, IS 250), but not real cheap (Civic, Mazda 3). But, a lot of car and features for the $$, if you overlook the VW badge.

I won't get a 30K+ car past the boss (or the moths in my wallet), and I can't really find anything that floats the boat in the high teens/low 20s (the Legacy was the best bet there).

A TSX is an idea. Maybe should try one again, but the 2.0T is a sweet engine. Lower cruising RPM, and a boat load of torque. No need to rev the dickens out of it like on the TSX.

The Jetta would probably be +/- 3 K less initially too.

Besides, lousy resale is another reason to hang onto it, and I can (and have) keep a car for 6+ years if I like it. The key is to get one I like to start with. And this one really will have to last me through the first college run (7 years at this point) ends, unless my son does me a favor and gets a good scholorship.

That, and if I buy another one now, my wife will hit me with a cast iron skillet if I even mention looking at another car!

Once I drive the Jetta I will have a better idea of what to do. The Legacy would be a good deal, but it's bad news if I start out with some ""issues"" that should/probably/hopefully get used to eventually..."
4770	December 1, 2005 7:56PM	woodyww	"The RR ""only"" cost me about $10K (in one year!), between depreciation, & maintenence costs, to get the LR bug out of my system. My current bmw (in 4 years) has cost me a few hundred$$ in maintenence, & maybe, if I sold it now, say $15K in depreciation. What's that?--$4K a year roughly.

BTW--(you own a new 3 Series, is that right?)--I picked up my 6 y.o. 5-series today from the mechanic--cost me $218 to fix the central locking problem. (How many cars would cost less than that to fix a similar problem)? I was telling the owner I was thinking of selling the car. He looked at the mileage (24K miles), & said to keep it, unless I got some unbelieveable offer for it. I think he's right--I probably wouldn't get enough extra for the low miles to make it worth it to sell, if that makes sense.

I just have this terrible urge right now to buy another vehicle, & if I bought one that cost $25-$30K, I'd have to sell the E39. I could pay $10K for a car & keep mine--I wonder what a really nice, restored 2002 would cost? Or.......?"

That's not a bad price for an electrical repair on a European car.

The only way I'd sell the 5-series at this point is if I got such a killer deal on a mint low-mileage MDX that I couldn't pass it up.

But, in 2/3 years, I would be back to square one, and don't want to end up on the permenant lease program.

The Jetta jsut feels good, but I do need to drive it. Now, if they threw out a hot year end lease deal, I owuld do it, and maybe buy it out at the end.

There was an ad yesterday for a true Zero down 39 month lease for (IIRC) $249/month, for a 5 speed value edition (I think, but the base car). If they had something comparable on a 2.0T(say $299/mo), that would be tempting.

Actually, one reason to lease is that I will be teaching my son to drive a stick on this car. Might as well return it when he is finished beating it up!

Anyway, I'm not that worried about owning a V Dub now. If it happens depends more on how good a deal they will cut me. If they throw out a number I can't resist, I'll do it.

I do seem to have cooled on the Legacy though. I like the leather much better than the cloth seats, but you can't get the non-turbo in a stick with leather. Plus, the car actually seems more suited to an AT for some reason."

The problem with buying a new car from a maker not known for great reliability, is that, no matter how nice the interior, or the leather, etc., after the 5th trip to the service dept. in 6 months, you won't care about any of that stuff, & will be at the Subaru dealer trying to trade it.

Just my own 2cents, FWIW."
4780	December 2, 2005 10:35PM	stickguy	"I think the fears sometimes get overblown. Not that many people really make 2 trips a month to the dealer, even with the ""unreliable"" brands. Now, If I got a complete lemon (from any maker), I would look to get out of it.

The only Sube that makes sense for me is a Legacy. I need to see the incoming SE (and drive it) to decide for sure, and see what the $$ are.

But, if the Jetta lease is heavily subsidised, I might go that way. basically make paymnets and look to buy it outright later on with the Money I get from my current car that can get stashed in the bank.

Besides, in 39 months, I'll know (hopefully) how much college is going to cost me!

I really better not explain any of this to the boss before I do it.

The other downside to leasing is I then have to sell my current car outright, without a trade in credit.

Actually, can you still trade in a car against a lease, and take the sales tax credit? It wouldn't be for the full amount, but still...

I was also considering a V50 since they have been advertising nice lease prices..."
4781	December 2, 2005 10:39PM	stickguy	"Just can't win really. Buy a boring but reliable car, and trade early from boredom. Buy excitement, and trade early if it breaks all the time.

Good thing I like going to car dealers. Even the service department doesn't bother me!

With the Jetta (prior generation), it seems like a couple of defective parts (coils and window regulators) caused most of the problems. I wonder how many people wouldn't consider their Jetta's ""junk"" if those 2 areas, which hopefully have been fixed, were never a problem?

A couple of bad O2 sensors 5 years from now isn't too scary."

He bought an Intrepid. One of those unreliable, nothing but dealer visit Chryslers. Best I can tell, in 5-6 years and 110K (twice what I would put on) he had only a couple of minor problems, at higher mileage.

But, you read some threads, and you would come to the conclusion that it's a miracle you can even get it home from the dealer without a breakdown.

Same for the guy that likes old Taurii and Oldsmobiles, and so on."

You still get the tax credit even if you are trading in a leased vehicle. We just traded the Ody (leased) for the MDX and paid almost no sales on the MDX. The price of the MDX was $22000 and the trade value of the Ody was $21000 so we only paid taxed on $1000. Pretty good deal considering we paid no tax on the Ody to begin with."

I still wouldn't put anything down on the lease, so I guess the dealer would have to cut a check back.

Sounds awfully convoluted.."
4787	December 3, 2005 4:05PM	anonymousposts	is a usage tax if I am not mistaken so trading your car would not lower this tax. Sales tax is only paid on the vehicle if you buy out the lease. If you trade it in the dealer can deduct what the tax would be for you to buy it thus making their payoff lower than what you would pay. If you think of it in terms of sales tax it actually benefits you to lease it. Depending on what the sales tax is in your state it could save you $1000+ on a $20,000 car. Since your car is paid for the dealer would have to cut you a check back for the value of the tC. If you do decide to lease it may pay to sell the car on your own or shop it around at local dealers (maybe Carmax if you have one close to you) and get the most money possible. Considering the popularity of the car and the low miles on yours it might be most beneficial to sell it private owner to a parent buying their child a Christmas present.

We've explored most of our options and there isn't a car out there that matches 100% to what he wants right now. The IS250 was OK but the stick felt sloppy compared to our Accord and Gee hated the dash without the NAV. With the NAV the price is $35,000 but he still won't like the way the car shifts. He does not like the G35's interior even after the refresh. He doesn't want FWD so that rules out the TSX and the TL. At the end of the day we decided that the Accord is the best way to go. It drives great, has been reliable, has XM radio, and has one of the best manual trannys on the market.

So.... we are in the process of buying out the Accord lease and we will drive both it and the MDX until 100,000 miles. We will add some wheels to it, go to Florida and get the windows tinted, and maybe drop it a bit depending on how it looks with the wheels.

4806	December 8, 2005 2:24AM	anonymousposts	"We looked at it this way.

The residual on the Accord is $13,800 X 5% sales tax had we bought it out at the end of the lease. That's $14,400. Financed for 2 years @ 3.4% that's $14,904 + $6480 in remaining lease payments. That's $21,384. Honda does not negotiate lease residuals so we would pay the $13800 at the end regardless.

If we buy out the Accord right now the payoff is $19,700. Financed for 48 months @ 5% we will end up paying $21,744. Not that much of a difference. Might as well buy it now and stop worrying about the mileage. We will pay it off before 48 months so the totals will be even closer. Also, in 18 months our payoff will be $12,800 vs. a $13,800 residual + tax if we continue the lease."

The problem? She's massively buried in the Yukon.

The Volvo dealer originally offered $27K as a trade value ... sis and BIL owe $36K.

This, mind you, is for an '04 V70 2.5T with 26,000 miles and an asking price of $26K.

Volvo dealer has since raised their bid for the Denali to $31K. Sis still says no, and thinks she can sell it for $35K privately.

I took a quick look at Edmunds TMV ... if she can get $31K in trade, she should take it and run, as that's the private party selling value. Retail is $35K, which I believe she will never see.

Methinks that my sister will be driving the Denali for some time to come. She tells me she gets 12-13MPG and it costs her $55 to fill it up ... that is down from a max of $75 a month or two ago.

She doesn't drive too much and is a perfect candidate for a lease - she works from home, her kids' school is just down the block (10 minute walk) and most of her shopping needs are very close by as well."

4824	December 12, 2005 2:31PM	michaellno	"I agree with you ... since my sister works at home (in home child care) and all her amenities are so close, I understand your financial argument.

I totally forgot about the new GM full-sized SUVs being released next year and the effect it will have on the current generation values - another valid point.

What I find funny (in a sad sort of way) is that she really didn't want the Denali in the first place. She had a perfectly serviceable Odyssey; I suspect that my BIL, being the ""image"" kind of guy that he is, didn't like driving a minivan (he also traded out of a G35 lease for a lease on a 530i).

Now they are stuck with a $750/mo note for the Denali, the 12-13 MPG that they get.

Here's my sister's logic (I think):

Current Denali payment: $750
new payment (she hopes): $400-500
Monthly savings: $250-350

Gas (per month) - sis says she only fills up every other week @ $55 per tank: $110
Not sure what V70 gets for gas mileage, but she may be able to get away with 1 1/2 tanks of gas per month, and we'll estimate $35 per tank: $50-55
Monthly savings: $55-60

So, she would be saving approximately $300-400 per month.

If, and it's a big if, she can get, let's say, $32K for the Denali ($4K upside down), she's looking at 10-13 months to make up the difference.

Or is my math all wrong?

Don't know about insurance costs."
4825	December 12, 2005 7:52PM	woodyww	"I'm not smart enough to figure out these deals where the owner is upside down on their current vehicle, & to boot is financing the new one. And I don't base my opinion to sell the Denali just on the fuel cost--more on how that may affect the resale value later on--& what if gas prices go up more?

I don't see a downside to this--if--she's getting a great price for the SUV, & not getting ripped on the Volvo or the financing for it. And whether or not someone is ""upside down"", I'm not sure that means they shouldn't sell the vehicle--that's a ""sunk cost"", right? i.e., they're upside down even if they keep it. (They've already lost that amount, whatever they do, right)?

And paying $55 to fill up, you better really like the vehicle, or it does get depressing......whatever the logic. You could also ask Terry on the RWTIV board--I'm sure he could analyze the whole situation if you provided all the info.....And FWIW, I can't even imagine a $750 car payment."
4826	December 12, 2005 9:53PM	corvette	"I remember when the full-size GM trucks got a more user-friendly interior back in 1995, a fully loaded 4x4 Suburban with leather seats was around $36,000. At that price, it cost little more than an entry level luxury car. Now, if you add a sunroof and nav system, a Yukon XL is around $50k, the Denali is $56k, and the Escalade is $64-ish. Any of those is a good bit more than an entry-level luxury car. I think the full-size GM trucks are better bought used.

One question remains: Is GM mad? $64k is M-class money, and that even includes the AMG sport package and Keyless Go. You could also have a Cayenne. Also, the Japanese offerings have the same features but much lower sticker prices. It's no wonder GM has to offer so many incentives to move these things."

Have had both in my life, the 240 was a LOT less work to keep going once I got it fixed up.

Thing is, if I want it to be street-legal, it has to pass the CA smog test, which will probably keep me from buying anything carbureted. That leaves me the awfully temperamental gen-II RX-7s or the 300ZX on up, which were too big and overstyled IMO. I guess there's always the 280Z, pretty hard to find though. Saw one a few weeks back, the guy wanted $9 grand for a car with rust in lots of places and ""brand new"" interior and engine - have no idea what that meant but the interior was a bit ratty too, so only certain parts must have been new. I couldn't help thinking ""is this guy high or what?"".

Hate ragtops, so Miata is out. But I had actually considered a Mustang, which would be my first if I went that route. It would have to be a GT - if I were getting a V-6 I would probably just go buy an older Celica. But yes, Mustang is in the game.

And of course Prelude is always a good choice. The 4WS ones from the early 90s are OUT, but the new style from (1992?) on is very much in consideration.

I would love one of the final Preludes (the hard square design) but the price is going to be too high for me to have as a project car. I was kinda thinking of something in the $4-8K range, preferably closer to $4K.

Wouldn't mind picking up one of the first Impreza 2.2s, but they are HARD to find - they just didn't sell enough of them.

Or a Tercel ""Black Hawk"" from the mid-90s, but that is just a passing thought probably."

Cute cars, but no power or handling upgrades of any substance. I like the alloys.

Now of course, I am mainly looking at Japanese cars there. Given the terrible depreciation of the American models and the general air of long-term unreliability of the German models, those might be better as leases. In fact, I can't think of any German model I would buy, given all the long-term problems they have. I would be sure to lease if I picked one of those up.

Of course, the very best VW can do for leases right now still isn't that great. A Jetta VE for $250/month plus tax, and I still have to give them $1000 or more to drive the car away? There are MANY more expensive cars with similar terms.

I'm not sure I agree (but i could be wrong). Let's say you want to buy it. But, at the time, money factor is a great deal lower than a 5-year note rate. So you lease. Then, at the end of the 3 years, you finance the remainder for 2 years, again, at a very low rate (providing rates in general haven't gone through the roof) because its only a 2-year note.

You could feasibly save on interest overall by doing this, no?

Granted, you are taking a chance that interest rates could be higher at the end of your lease than they were when you started ... but for the sake of an argument, let's say they are very similar at the beginning of the lease and the end."

Saab has some good deals considering what they're actually worth after 24 months, but I think they only include 10,000 miles a year. Some of the prices would make it tempting to just make the remaining payments and turn it in in 15/18 months when you hit the mileage limit. Subaru's leases always seem to be a good deal on the base models, but only fair--and nothing more--on the loaded models.

When I had my snow tires put on a few days ago, the indpendent BMW mechanic was saying that the spark plugs on BMWs only last around 80,000 miles compared to the 100k that BMW claims. My only response was that I had a long ways to go, but I thought to myself I'll be lucky to keep a car that long!"

It could work for someone that is fiscally responsible, and can stick with the plan... that isn't very many of us.... Plus, when that lease is up, and you can lease another new car for the same amount as the 48 month payment on the car you are buying out of the lease....

In Colorado, you pay for the registration separate .. it doesn't get handled by the dealer, but is a percentage of the value of the car (2.1% in year 1, 1.8% in year 2, etc.).

Which means that you're looking at $1100 initially (first pmt + $625 acquisition fee), then another $800-900 for the tags.

The first time we licensed the Expedition, it cost something like $700! And, since we had also leased a VW New Beetle at about the same time, the check we wrote to the DMV was over $1000!

Now that we're buying our cars, the annual renewal keeps decreasing each year .. I'm hoping to spend something like $600 for all 3 of our cars this year. As if that wasn't bad enough, since we were foolish enough to buy all of our cars in November, the renewal is due in January of each year, so I've got to have that money ready to go right after the holidays!

Not exactly great, but IMO better than leasing a brand new bmw or whatever @$500/mo., & ending up with Nothing at lease end. And, I now still own a low mileage car worth maybe $17-$19K (I think). Instead of Nothing, if I had leased a $300/mo car for 48 months.....

I guess, after thinking about it for 20 minutes, I realized that as much as I hate

4888	December 18, 2005 4:07PM	woodyww	"GOOD point. I'm biased towards owning high end German cars, & the only way I can sanely do that is to buy them used with a few miles & years on them. And probably paying cash is part of the equation, to avoid financing charges on a used car.

So the discussion of leasing a New 525i at $500/mo. got me thinking about what buying my then 2 y.o. 5 series has really cost me. A lot less than buying or leasing a new one. And, & don't have to fool around now leasing another car, with more payments.

Another way I'm looking at it is, the kind of new cars I could have leased at the time for around $300/mo. were IMO not remotely in the same league at all as a bmw 5-series.
Of course, I had to cough up $34K upfront, which a lot of people can't or don't want to do (I'm not sure I would at this point).

I'm also usually a ""keep a car for 10 years"" kind of guy (if I really like the car). So it would be interesting to compare what that costs over 10 years rather than going thru 3 or 4 leases during that time. So I'm hoping that by keeping the car another few years I can really make the initial purchase ""pay off"".

Of course all of this is based on my personal preferances. It ""feels like"" I'm being more frugal to pay cash for a really nice 2 y.o. car., & keep it for 8-10 years. And I can thus ""rationalize"" owning a really nice BMW. And of course, a truly sick bmw nut sometimes needs to rationalize like crazy.

Gotta go, & think up some reasons why it ""makes sense"" for me to buy an M3.......

cheers, woody"

And you will get the extra $2.5K versus the VW back when you sell it someday (& probably more than that, compared to a VW of the same year).

And if I get the sense of your post, it seems like you ""want"" the Acura more than the VW, or Subie....."
4890	December 19, 2005 1:55AM	anonymousposts	"fits all of your criteria + the bonus is that it is an Acura which will probably net you better service as well as less of that better service.

The TSX has the 6-speed, safety, reliability, great seats, and every other doo-dad is standard (except NAV). Plus, it's got the turn signals in the mirror.

FWIW: Our dealership just offered $14,000 on a 05 TC with 15,000 miles. Maybe there is more money to be had on your trade. Have you tried shopping it around at a Scion dealer? If they don't have a lot of inventory they might give you good money to sell it back."
4891	December 19, 2005 3:32AM	stickguy	"I think carmax would offer more.

The Sube dealer called Saturday and came up to 13K on it. I told them I wanted 14K, and if they had taken it I would probably have the Legacy already.

I did stop at the Scion dealer I bought it from and chatted with the salesdude. I did say I might trade it. They came back (sight unseen) with 13K, which was ""book"". But, per Terry's nice little list, it seems they are going well above book at this point.

Oh, and they had another 2005 on used row (an AT, silimilar miles), asking $19,995. A different local dealer has a 5 speed '05 listed at $19,995 also. Mine is just about front row ready. DOesn't even need to be waxed, since I just did it!

Actually, the Sube is a nice car, and has a lot going for it. There are a couple of things that aren't quite right for me, but nothing that would prevent me from living with it.

Of course, it doesn't have the nifty electroluminescant (sp?) guages, XM built in (I really, really want this..), super comfy seats, all those gadgets (like bluetooth) that I will never use but still want to have, and I'm sure a few other niceties (steering wheel audio I guess).

I always did like the TSX, but it is a bit pricey. THe real comparison should be to an Accord EX-L, which has almost all the good stuff, or at least enough to make a 5K price difference hard to justify, but I'm sure I will manage somehow.

I will have it for 10 years if I get something nice, so I better like it!"
4892	December 19, 2005 3:42AM	anonymousposts	We have it in our Accord and it's worth it. Normal FM/AM radio just seems outdated and unsatisfying once you have experienced XM radio.
4893	December 19, 2005 4:43AM	woodyww	"How much more is the TSX than the Subaru model? And is AWD important to you at all?

I think if you got a really great deal on either, you wouldn't go wrong. But I'm still hearing that the TSX turns you on. If you want it, & can afford it, I'd say go for it. It's an Acura......"
4894	December 19, 2005 4:53AM	stickguy	"isn't really that important. I just liked the way the SUbe drives. I really wouldn't mind having RWD, but none of the options really work for me (either functionally or $$ wise).

THe TSX drives real nicely for a FWD car, so I don't have any problems with that. Plus, I will be teaching my son to drive in 1.5 years, so getting something too tricky (or powerful) might not be the best idea.

The teenage thing was actually one of the pluses to the Legacy, but I think a TSX would be OK too."
4895	December 19, 2005 7:14PM	corvette	XM is nice, and I would probably listen to the radio regularly if I had it. What is their pricing plan like if you have more than one receiver?
4896	December 19, 2005 7:17PM	andre1969	they're starting to pipe that stuff in on the upper Directv stations, and I'm starting to see its allure. Dunno if I'd be ready to spring for it in a car yet, though.
4897	December 19, 2005 8:13PM	stickguy	you pay for each receiver, but you get some sort of discount when you have multiples.
4898	December 20, 2005 2:15AM	hammen2	I think it's $12.95 for the first one, and $6.95 ea. for receivers 2 through 4. I have all 4 (my two cars/one SkyFi boombox at work, wife's truck, mother) though service is presently suspended for the Roady in my GTO, since it's in storage...
4899	December 20, 2005 9:07PM	woodyww	One of the reasons I stay in the Boston area--& put up with the insane cost of housing here (& just about everything, for that matter)--is the 2 or 3 superb non-commercial FM stations, for Jazz &/or Classical music--esp. WGBH. You wouldn't believe what a difference it makes.....

Also, if you don't want to pay for so many recievers and subscriptions you can buy one reciever and have a docking station installed in each vehicle."

The ad for the truck can be found here

He is currently driving a 2001 Saturn L200 - he owes around $3K and they offered him $1800 in trade. With tax, it comes out to around $19K.

We did some quick figuring with Edmunds TMV and came up with $16.2K - they are asking $16.9K. When we told him that the payments would be $350-400 a month for 5 years, it stopped him short.

Never did get a call back ... I'm assuming that once he got the numbers from the dealer, he chose not to proceed.

OTOH, I found out that our L300 needs new front pads and rotors. Looks to be about $300-500 to replace. Was told that the front pads are too soft to be turned."

Just trying to help out.."
4908	December 22, 2005 3:23AM	stickguy	"Gee, thanks for helping out. Not consider all options? Is there anything I missed?

Don't worry, it wasn't a Subaru. I brought home a relative to keep our Odyssey company. No, not the TSX, I got it's middle aged brother. In honor of Gee and Anony, I got an Accord EX-L 5 speed.

Probably the last '05 of it's kind to be found. Even the dealer was surprised that I found it. Still brand new (only 11 miles on it, and I put on 1/2 of them on an earlier test drive). It was also built in 8/05, so it's just about as real-time new as an '06.

It be silver with black guts. Drives amazingly nice, and worlds ahead of the tC in comfort, refinement, etc. Also much longer, which I have to remember when pulling into the garage, but not much (if at all) wider.

I finally decided (courtesy of the TSX) that I really ""needed"" heated leather thrones. And I finally came to the conclusion that not getting built-in XM was going to lead to a serious case of buyers remorse.

The Legacy was actually very nice, and a tidier (TSX ish) size, but the Honda is a whole bunch roomier and more comfortable, so the family (especially the wife) will appreciate it.

And did I mention XM?

FUnny thing is, after seeing them side by side, I realized that the car looks better with the old butt. It just matches better, and looks OK in silver. I may spring for a spoiler some day, which really changes the look of the back end.

SO far, up to 25 miles, and still happy! Might be a new record.

Plus, with all the luxury goodies, I really might not having this for the 10 years I will be required to keep it.

SO, whoever had an Accord in the pool, collect your prize."
4909	December 22, 2005 3:29AM	stickguy	"It ended up costing me about $600 more to get into the Accord (+/- a few $$ due to different accessories), but that's how much more it cost me above the amount I would have paid for the Sube. Considering that the Sube dealer had dropped his shorts completely, and the Honda stickered for about 2K more, I think I did OK.

I'll have this one for so long that the 1 MY diff will be insignificant, plus in 9 years I will have the cleanest 75K Accord around.

Depending on how you rig the numbers, I basically got above book for my trade, and 4K discount on the Honda. Best guess, at least 2K less than an '06 would have cost me, maybe more like 2.5K, so enough to make it worth my while. Plus, the wife signed off on the deal (I think she was happy I wasn't getting the Sube, since she saw some problems in the future with that one). Yes, we have been married a long time.

Happiest of all is my 14 YO son, who no longer has to clambor into the back seat, and wait for someone to let him our. He likes having his own door again."

You can't get the 4 cyl Ranger in an ext cab until the '06 model. That 4 banger is essentially the same one that's in the Mazda3, so it's a nice motor and probably has the best MPG of any truck out there.

ps. Sent you an e-mail

4911	December 22, 2005 6:38AM	nippononly	"they were trying to capitalize on the fact that the truck had not yet reached 10K miles, by asking a price that was more than it probably cost new. It's a 4-cyl 2WD with the steel wheels, for goodness' sake. Shame on them for putting such a high price on it. I wouldn't pay a dime over $14K for that one.

OK, the Lexus dealer near me has THE MOST PRISTINE '91 ES250 I have ever seen. It has only 74K miles and looks like it has been parked in a garage all its life. Leather seats and moonroof, automatic, everything I never knew I wanted and always thought I didn't want, so why do I find myself irresistibly drawn to it? It actually looks cute to me. :confuse:

Asking price is $5K, I figure he would go a few hundred lower and price seems to be spot on. It has brand new tires and brakes, and it is truly immaculate. Why on Earth am I thinking about going for a second drive here????

I haven't been a one-car guy for many many years now, I should have known that trying to limit myself to just one vehicle was going to be my undoing."

4914	December 22, 2005 12:36PM	guss	"Congratulations on the new Accord. The rear end was a deal breaker for me the last time I was looking. I could not wait for them to change it. I would have got the coupe just to not have the sedan rear.

I think the sedan must have grown on me though because I think it is nicer than the new version. With the spoiler it actually looks good.

The one thing I miss now that winter is hear is my heated seats. I rarely used to wear a coat in the winter, I loved that heat message."
4915	December 22, 2005 2:49PM	gee35coupe	"Get the front and rear lip spoilers. You'll love em. If nothing else, they make your Accord different than all the others. Especially the front one since no one really knows about it. It visually lowers the front end at little.

And you are right about the XM. There is no substitute. Cept maybe an IPOD hookup and hundreds of CD's. That's the only thing I miss in my LS.

Speaking of the LS...I got a major service done at the dealer for Christmas. The first one since I bought it. $1000 down. I need a few bushings and rear brakes. I'll do em later but that's another grand. Not to mention the timing belt service coming up in a while. Hmmm...Carmax offered $5500. If I could find something else that I liked as much....."
4916	December 22, 2005 2:50PM	qbrozen	i'm not sure how you could resist the '06 6-speed V6 sedan. If I was shopping (again), that would be on my short list.
4917	December 22, 2005 2:53PM	gee35coupe	"We seriously don't like the new rear end. The V6 6 speed did call us back to the dealership but we just don't like the new look. We'd have no problem buying one. We've owned a coupe, and 2 EX-L sedans of this generation.

By the way Stickguy...Silver is our favorite color. Hope you love your car."

4919	December 22, 2005 3:54PM	michaellno	"The dealer he's been working with found him another truck to look at ....

2002 Chevy S-10, ext cab, V6, auto, power evreything, but 50K miles. They are asking $12K.

Talked with the kid for about an hour regarding his options. The Toyota has a TMV of around $17K, so the asking price seems to be in line with that. Asked him what he would rather be driving in 5 years, assuming 12K miles per year:

-> the Toyota with 60-70K on it, or
-> the Chevy with 110K on it

Given that the Toyota will probably last 150K easily, he would have another 5-7 years of life left on the Toyota after he pays it off.

We also talked about a new truck. The '06 Tacoma ext cab (4-cyl stick 2wd) invoices for under $16K - add some power goodies for another $1200 and you've got a pretty good deal for about what they are asking for the used truck.

Of course, finding something like that would probably be impossible, unless he decided to try looking in Las Vegas.

Hmm, now that I'm thinking about it, he might be able to get into a base Silverado for not much money. I seem to remember Andre talking about it over the summer when the employee pricing deal was going on."
4920	December 22, 2005 4:07PM	stickguy	"looks better for '05 with the all red taillights. Funny how a minor tweak makes a big difference.

Actually, the new rear looks OK by itself, but when you see them side by side, the old rear does match the car better. The new one looks tagged on, and makes the back end kinds boxy.

The 6 speed V6 was a thought (along with the TSX), but for the driving I do, the 4 cyl stick is plenty fast enough. No need to put my license any more at risk than it already is. This package is deceptively quick anyway, so it's not like I'm driving a rolling roadblock

Amazingly quiet too. With the XM cranked up, you can hardly hear anything else. Much more comfortable than the tC, and easier to get in/out of. The black leather interior looks very upscale too.

THe price difference was a mojor factor too. Yeah, the TSX was nice, and the V6 would be faster, but the really didn't offer much more that I would benefit from, at least not 6-7K worth.

And lastly, in 1.5 years my son learns to drive, so no need for something too fast for that!

And don't tell the wife, but by getting the cheaper car, I can now look for a toy again (err., something to work on for my sone, yeah, that's the ticket!)"
4921	December 22, 2005 4:08PM	nippononly	"Yeah, I WAS looking for a manual shift, and I am not usually a fan of leather either. But I am such a sucker for old cars that have been really well taken care of. This car has styling and an interior from a different era, which I think was a better era. Not to mention it was one of the two models that launched Lexus.

OK, I promise not to get misty-eyed...

:-P

You are correct, no motorized belts and it does have a driver's airbag. It also has ABS and does NOT have the electroluminescent gauges that have failed so expensively in some LS400s of that era.

michaell: it is absolutely true that you can get a 2WD regular cab 1/2-ton Silverado for $15,8 right now with Red Tag pricing. I just saw the ad on TV.

It will GUZZLE gas next to the Tacoma, probably doubling runnning costs. But I would not pay almost $17K for the Tacoma either, and you are quite right that for $17K you could get into a brand new '06 Tacoma 2WD with the base package of options (convenience package, or something like that?). You would still have A/C and a CD radio, not to mention the plastic non-rusting bed, for the same money. I say it again, I wouldn't pay a penny over $14K for the '04 Tacoma. OK, maybe $14,5 if it is really that nice."
4922	December 22, 2005 4:22PM	michaellno	"At some of the local dealers in St. George.

Several Colorados for under $14K - 2.8L 4 banger and stick, but these were the regular cab.

Lots of Rangers - again, base 2.3L with stick and vinyl seats are priced under $14K. They also have a white super cab with the 3.0L V6 and a stick for $16.5K. Also have a few F-150's - 4.2L V6 and a stick for $15.5; add $900 for an automatic.

I'm ambivalent about the '05 vs. '06 rear end treatment on the Accord. Still, if you got $4K off the cost of the new car and above average money on the trade, then I think you got a pretty sweet deal.

Enjoy the ride!

PS I, too, would like to hear from Jolie and see if she's gotten settled in Texas.

PPS I called my son in Utah and told him about the Ranger super cab with the V6 and stick. Turns out he's working right across the street from the dealer today!

Will try to keep folks posted."

Also a much better cruiser on the highway. Very relaxed at 70, instead of buzzing along at 3,200 RPM.

Pretty impressive, I have had it for almost a full day, and haven't stopped to look at replacements yet!"
4925	December 22, 2005 7:28PM	andre1969	"I think I spec'ed out a GMC Sierra (I prefer their style to the Silverado) the way I would've wanted it, regular cab, long bed, with a 4.8 V-8, automatic, sliding rear window, CD player, and limited slip for under $17K. Going with the 4.3 V-6, which would still be a better performer than the 305 in my '85 Silverado, got it to under $16K. I was really tempted at the time, but instead just sunk another $1100 into my '85 to keep it running. Plus, it would've been almost impossible to find just that truck. I searched dealer inventories and most of their trucks were pretty loaded up. Plus, the regular cab/8-foot bed style is something of a rarity these days.

Just for kicks, I went to the Chevy website and spec'd a Silverado. Came out to a red tag price of $16,866.65. Pretty tempting, but I doubt I'd be able to find just the truck I wanted. Of course, I'd be willing to take one more optioned up, for the same price!"

We order a couple a year sans the cd player. You should be able to find one on most larger dealer's lots.(Just in case another $1100 transfusion comes up)."
4927	December 22, 2005 8:28PM	woodyww	"At the prices you guys are talking about, I'd probably just buy new. And usually I'd go for a Toyota over a Chevy, but at what, $15.8K? for a new full size chevy p/u, it makes you think. I would not buy a 2002 Chevy S-10 w/50K miles for $12K, no matter what.....

Of course, the Toyota should last forever. With the chevy, I'd consider what the dealer is like where you buy it/get it serviced. And the Toyota might be a ""hipper ride"" for your son (?)

My own experience with 1 chevy p/u, & 1 Toyota, was like night & day (guess which)? At that time tho, a full size GM p/u was about twice the size of the little toyotas in the mid-80s, so presumably much safer. So I'd consider safety too, if there's any data on current models."
4928	December 22, 2005 8:34PM	andre1969	"I guess one of the things I was getting nitpicky about was a sliding rear window, which seems to be a rarity these days. I guess I could always have one put in though, on a truck with a solid rear window. And the only limited-slip rear-end I've ever owned is currently sitting in a plastic bin packed away somewhere in my Grandma's garage, awaiting installation into my '68 Dart. Of course, it's been awaiting installation for about 7 years now! :blush: So I really don't know what I'm missing there.

So maybe I will think about a new truck the next time something major comes up with this one.

Oh, and on the subject of Chevy S-10's, I hear the 4.3 in them is a horrible guzzler. Although for some reason it's NOT that bad in the full-sized trucks, so I wonder why it would get such a bad rap in the small ones? :confuse:"
4929	December 22, 2005 9:28PM	michaellno	"Nah, I don't think he's looking for a 'hipper ride'. He's starting to work as a plumber's apprentice and needs the truck for the tools he will be acquiring.

He's looking for a truck much like andre spec'd out - AC, CD player, stick shift, crank windows.

I'm pretty sure he is going to stay away from the '02 S-10. It's possible that he will check out the Ranger or he might end up buying the used Toyota.

I told him to call me tonight after he gets off work so we can discuss further."
4930	December 22, 2005 10:16PM	jaserb	"I've had some experience with the Ford and GM little trucks. I've owned 2 S10s, never owned a Ranger but I've looked at a bunch. The s10 got decontented in 1998 and it really shows - I had a '97 with over 100k miles, then a '98 with under 40k. The '97's interior was in far better shape than the '98, even with many more miles. The 4.3 V6 is pretty torquey but very thirsty. I've never had a 4 banger.

The Rangers / Mazdas come with 3 motors, the 2.3, 3.0, or 4.0. The 2.3 and 4.0 are good motors, but the 3.0 is better used as a boat anchor. It's the old Vulcan v6 that's been in Taurii since the '80s. It barely has the power of the 4 cyl (I think it's like 4 more hp) but sucks gas just like the 4.0. The worst of both worlds. I still think the truck I mentioned earlier is the best deal going in a small truck - the Mazda B2300 SE Cab Plus. They came pretty loaded - A/C and CD were standard, I think. They can be tough to find though. I nearly pulled the trigger on one last fall that was at a local lot listed at $9995, but I'd just fixed the A/C on my old Dodge and wanted to milk a few more miles out of it.

Here's an example of the truck I'm talking about, pretty close to you I think:

I know he's well up over 100,000 miles on it, and has run the hell out of it. He used to work as a courier for a real estate title company. The truck still looks great, but sounds horrible. It's nasty enough on start-up that sometimes it'll wake me up if he starts it early enough! :surprise: And on more than a few occasions, I'd be out early walking the dog in the yard, and he'd scare the crap out of me when he started it up! For lack of a better word, the thing shrieks.

He used to have a '75 Valiant with a slant six that he sold back in the spring, and I swear that sucker was whisper quiet, and the epitome of sophistication compared to that Ranger!"
4932	December 23, 2005 1:33AM	jjtj	FWIW, I bought a 99 Ranger Xcab with the 3.0L new.. I sold it last year and I still miss it. It was one of the best vehicles I've owned. The 3.0 isn't the best, in particular, it would ping unless higher grade gas is used. Ford can reprogram the ECM to retard the timing, but then you lose power, which it only had 150 HP to begin with. Gas was always cheap when I owned it so I just used 89+ and didn't worry about it. Never had a single problem with it, and it was very comfortable with the ext. cab. I wouldn't hesitate for a minute to buy another.

That little Ranger didn't have much pick up but it ran good and served it's purpose perfectly for a purchase price of $8,200 (new).

We have explored every single option the last couple of days trying to fall off the wagon but, yet again, there is no car better than the Accord for the money. The only one that would make us both happy is probably a TL. I don't think it's worth it to trade the Accord alone for the TL so that's out. We did consider trading both the MDX and the Accord for a TL but I would hate to see the Accord go and I like the size of the MDX for trips with my nieces in tow. Obviously, we think very highly of the Accord. It's way more comfortable for me than the 05 RX330 Gee has had as a loaner while his LS is in the shop."
4935	December 23, 2005 1:37AM	anonymousposts	Rangers are great trucks. I think it would be a better bet than the Colorado. The most reliable choice is probably the Tacoma but they are priced accordingly. What about a Frontier? Might be a good compromise.

It's the 3.5 automatic, 2wd, regular cab, regular box, and gets about 23 mpg on the highway. We've had a few Sonomas in our family, and the 4.3/automatic gets 22-23 mpg highway, and the 2.2/stick gets about 25-26.

We also had a Sierra 5.3/automatic regular cab, regular box, which got 18-19 mpg on the highway...

Any of the trucks listed will be gas guzzlers with an extended or crew cab, 4wd, and an automatic."
4937	December 23, 2005 3:24AM	racer63	I've put a total of 230,000 miles on a pair of Rangers, that were both used hard. No mechanical issues what so ever. I'd rate them equally or more durable than a Toyota or Nissan. The Mazda suggestion is a good one too, as only the badge is different. On a V6 2wd stick, expect to average around 20 mpg combined.
4938	December 23, 2005 3:57AM	racer63	"While I haven't posted much here lately, I have been keeping current with all the various adventures being shared. Been making a few of my own.

Mrs. Racer63 is allowing me to look at cars, and has extended the leash suprisingly long with what I am considering. The family fleet at the moment consists of an '86 Honda Civic that is race prepped as an autocross car - no chance of driving to the supermarket for a gallon of milk in that beast, a 2004 GMC 2500HD Crew Cab that serves as the family truckster, and is her daily driver, and a 2000 Toyota Celica GT, about to hit six figure mileage that I wail upon.

I feel the ""need"" for something fun, and also that says ""I've arrived"". I also really could use a normal car with 4 doors, considering we currently have only either my girly coupe or her monster truck at our disposal. While the Toyota has been exceeding reliable, except for multiple trannys covered under warranty, I figure I only have about another 30k miles, or 2 years at my current mileage accrual, before moderately expensive repair/replacements will be needed. Most of my choices involve keeping the Celica as a beater, putting off dealing with the future daily driver issue for now.

My shopping list is as follows:

Frivolous: New Miata, new Solstice, used 00-01 Boxster S
Price - $22k to $32k + always needing a daily diver around

Solves all the needs and wants: Used 04-05 330i 4 dr w/ Performance Pkg = nice car, and if the Toyota goes kaput, it wouldn't necessarily need to be replaced.
Price - $32k +/-

Practical: New Mazda 3 (or Accord?), to use as another 6 yr/100k daily driver; sell Celica and Honda, and then find a fun show-off car.
Price, with S-plan OTD - $17k + then finding the appropriate fun-mobile, without distractions arising that would prevent me doing the 2nd purchase.

A S2000 was on the list, but Mrs. is not comfortable in it. My 8 & 9 year olds want me to get a C5 Z06 Corvette, but that is just a little too extreme, and spendy as well.

After starting off this escapade with the 330 as the front runner, I had backed off going in the Miata direction, with a side detour to Solstice. Somewhere along there I realized for $30k +/- would get me into a relatively late model CPO Porsche. :blush: But before that point I ended up thinking practical with a Mazda 3. Now all that has come kind of full circle after having an appropriately packaged 330i end up on a local dealer's lot, that I went on a test drive with today. A sweet car I could get very used to.

Anyone care to help me get less confused?"

Racer, I'm with you on this one. My 96 Ranger XL Extended Cab 4-cyl, 5-speed has 240,000 on it and is still running great. It's starting to show its age a bit and it has a lot of dents and scratches, but mechanically seems to be in good shape and the interior is immaculent, not even a hole in the vinyl floor covering.

Granted, the Ranger is not a truck you want to go drag racing in, but if you need an inexpensive, reliable, easy to maintain truck its really hard to beat."

4942	December 23, 2005 3:38PM	andre1969	"I've heard it get slammed for style too, but truthfully I think it's one of the better looking smaller trucks out there. IMO, most other trucks, like the Dakota, Tacoma, and Frontier, are overstyled. Their proportions are awkward, too many creases, features like oversized headlights or poor-fitting grilles that just don't flow well with the rest of the design, etc.

In contrast, the Ranger just has a clean, uncluttered look about it. It's not going to wow anyone with its cutting edge style, but at the same time it's not going to look grotesquely outdated like a car with tailfins would have by 1962, or a mid-70's mastodon in the early 80's.

Now I actually like the look of the Colorado and Canyon, although they're more cluttered and ""busy"" than the Ranger. I guess there's just a simple sort of honesty that the Ranger seems to exude, kinda like a broken in pair of jeans that you don't want to throw away, even though they've got holes in the knees and other places.

I liked the '97-04 style of Dakota, which had I thought did the ""baby Ram"" look pretty well, and still seemed clean and well-proportioned. The new one just seems awkward, though.

The Frontier and Tacoma might be great trucks, but if I was in the mood for a cheap little workhorse (and if I could fit in it...can't remember the last time I've been in a Ranger), I might be tempted by a Ranger."

4948	December 24, 2005 7:40PM	jefferyg	I think some of the automakers ought to consider going back to a true compact pickup about the size of the older Mazdas and Toyotas. Sure offer an upscale model with a four-door cab, but also make a true mini-truck with nice 4-cyl/5-speed that will get 30 or better on the highway. If it had any decent styling at all it would be an instant success in today's market.
4949	December 25, 2005 2:35AM	racer63	"Here's my excuse. The reason for this eclectic list of cars to choose from, is that since my primary form of recreation is autocrossing, all these rides should do very well in their respective classes they compete in.

There is one sitting on the used car side of an Audi dealer one town over. They're asking $32,995, which I think is a wee bit high for a non-CPO, has just had minor paintwork, shows a couple of curb rashed spots on the wheels example with 20k miles. I did a test drive last Thursday, and could easily learn to live with it on a daily basis. :P I really would like to find a CPO example, but they are showing up with advertised prices in the $36-38 range. Terry says this one could go home with me for $29ish. I'm just not sure they'll go down that far, and this item, while in ""acceptable"" shape, certainly doesn't glow in the dark.

used 00-01 Boxster S--I wouldn't take that on. If you think think bmw maintenence is high, wait til you own a Porsche. Now, if you had the $$ to buy & support a 911......

I know all about Por$che Part$. I do have a friend who runs the front end of an independent Porsche shop about an hour away. If I bought in this direction, he'd become an even better friend. Given my sporting intent with whatever I get, I did manage to trip over a M030 Sport Chassis example fairly close by. They are even more of a needle in a haystack than a ZHP 330. This one is CPO at a Porsche dealer, and the warranty does run basically bumper to bumper for 2 years. Plenty enough time to get the Porsche wants out of my system.

C5 Z06 Corvette--Why does it have to be a Z06? The regular model can be had in a hatchback version so it's a lot more practical for trips, or schlepping stuff around town.

See that initial paragraph I wrote....however, knowing a number of people with them, they are not without their issues, notably control arm bushings and fatal engine-internal things going bang. And I cannot imagine how much chaos I could get myself into with 405hp under my right foot.

The C5 'vette would be totally mind-blowing. The E46 330i would be only slightly less so, & would also be a good year 'round, all purpose car.....the Miata idea is good, but kind of pales after you've mentioned those 2.....

The E46 ZHP would certainly be the best all-around compromise. Snob appeal, performance, and 4-doors. I was leaning seriously in the Miata direction, but as fun as they are, I'm afraid it would be somewhat underwhelming compared to the other things I'm considering. I also figure I'd never sell it, because nothing would ever go wrong with it, and just give to my now 8 year old daughter in 9 years when she starts to drive; chick car that they are. :surprise:

Any manufacturer could easily do this now by taking their existing compact truck and putting a four-cylinder turbodiesel in it... Once one company does it, it will be like the crew-cab compact trucks, those that are late to market (I'm thinking of GM in that instance) will be left wondering why they didn't think of that.

The Boxers are gorgeous, I think, real eye candy. Only slightly less so than the 911.

The E46 ZHP at the audi dlr--what does it have for options, like xenons, etc? Hard to know what kind of low price they might take the last week of the year. Have you done a search for CPO versions listed by bmwna? Often bmw dealers are the devil to get a good price out of on a used car. But my current bmw I saw listed for months at a bmw dlr out in the sticks. The price kept coming down. Finally I went in on Dec. 30 & got the lowest price I'd seen at the time for that year & model, CPO, etc. And it was the lowest mileage one I'd seen. So I now believe in that shopping end-of-month, end-of-year stuff. Also the bmw dlr out in the sticks was way nicer than the snotty urban ones around here....."
4952	December 25, 2005 7:53PM	woodyww	"*Any manufacturer could easily do this now by taking their existing compact truck and putting a four-cylinder turbodiesel in it*

Great idea. I think I remember when you could buy little Mitsu p/u's with diesels (?).....then there were those weird little VW ""Rabbit"" diesel p/u's from the late '70's.

I had one of those tiny, tinny ""mini-trucks"" from the mid-eighties (a Toyota), that had the crash protection of a motorcycle. I wouldn't want to go back to that. What kind of mileage does a gas engine Taco w/stick shift, get anyway?"
4953	December 26, 2005 5:59AM	michaellno	"He's decided to hang on to the Saturn for the time being. I think he really doesn't want to spend the extra money on a higher payment, not to mention higher insurance premiums, at the present time. For the first time in a while, he's got some extra cash in his budget and I think he's enjoying having it too much (income = $1400/mo, obligations = $500/mo) to commit to anything more.

Am trying to convince him to make extra payments on the Saturn to pay it off quicker, so that when he does get the itch, he won't be so buried in it. If he can get it paid off, he might be able to get $1000-1500 for it in trade and help him qualify for the loan in his name only, as opposed to having his mother and I cosign.

Thanks to one and all for their opinions -- when he does decide to pull the trigger, I feel better that the Ranger might be the best direction for him to go. Would also have him consider Nissan and Mazda as well."
4954	December 29, 2005 5:13AM	jefferyg	"Yes, but diesels pose a number of problems as well.
1. Many people don't like the noise and smoke. Granted these are not the kind of problems they used to be.
2. Diesels are more costly to purchase. If you don't put a lot of miles on a vehicle, you're probably not saving any money.
3. Diesel currently costs more than premium unleaded where I live, and I think that is not uncommon across the country.
4. Diesels are usually more costly to maintain, although they often outlast gasoline engines. However, with the lower sulfur diesel that is now being produced, I'm not sure that longevity is going to be what it has been.
5. Some states already prohibit the purchase of new diesels for personal use, such as in California.

The fact is that many of the older pickups with four-bangers and four-speed trannys got close to thirty. I drove a 79 Ford Courier with a 2.0 Mazda engine in it back when I was a teenager. It got 27-30 on the highway. Granted, it was probably not the safest vehicle on the highway.

I also had an 89 Ford Ranger with a 4 cyl and 5-speed and it got 27 on the highway."

Rated 22/27.

So I was at the dealer getting some stuff for my 4Runner the other day, and they have a car that caught my eye: a '98 Accord EX-L 4-cyl sedan. It's an automatic, not my favorite thing, but apart from that I really liked it - took it for a drive. 93K miles, dark green (which I like). Doesn't seem to need anything, except the tires are old - good tread but with lots of cracks, making me think it hasn't been driven much in the last couple years.

The dealer's asking price of $10,9 was put on by someone, I think, who was high at the time. They do put on a standard 3-month warranty covering 100% of costs. I took the average of Edmunds, KBB, and NADA Guide, and got a retail value of $8800, so I am thinking of offering them something in the $8K range. The interior is immaculate, but the outside is below average - lots of scratches and dings in the paint, and the alloys are totally scuffed to heck, as they always seem to be on that generation Accord - it was one of those models where the tires don't protect the rims from the curb enough.

I am a sucker for dark green cars...."

The trip was long (11 days) and difficult (bad roads). I'm glad its over. The Titan did an outstanding job of pulling that 4000 lb Uhaul over some of the highest mountains I've ever had to cross. We saw buffalo, caribou, mountain goats, sheep, you name it we probably saw it. The total trip was about 5000 miles, the Titan is now at 34,000 miles.

Christmas was fun this year, I hung with my best friend, went to all his family fuctions (met tons of people). Everything was great until Monday night, I was so sick (have been for a few days), I let him drive my Titan and he backed it into a tree busting off the pass side mirror. You can guess I went slightly (understatement) nuts. New mirror should be in tomorrow, then just have to get it put on. He's used to an Explorer, not the width or the mirrors on my Titan.

I like dark green cars too, some of the Toyota trucks/SUVS have had a nice dark green option over the years.....

That Accord--high miles, old tires, *lots of scratches and dings in the paint, and the alloys are totally scuffed to heck*. I totally don't know the prices, but if ""retail"" is $8800,
I'd be thinking $6K-ish--maybe-- to take on a 100K miles, 8-9 y.o. Accord. And I'd start deducting from that for the tires, paint, etc. I think if you paid $8K for this gem they'd do cartwheels all the way to the bank, & then hold their breaths until the check cleared."

The LTD 4WD with only 44K would be a raging bargain in my area at $14K. It would go for around $17K in a private sale, and probably $20K or so properly prepped and sold by a dealer.

The new one got huge, too big for my purposes, and for those of many 4Runner devotees over the years. OTOH, Toyota did pull in a whole DIFFERENT crowd of buyers (a slightly bigger crowd) by supersizing it, and it didn't hurt that they superengined it at the same time. The upcoming FJ is the proper successor to the 2002 4Runner, not the 2003 4Runner.

As for the Accord, well, this is why I don't usually go to dealers for used cars...I am a sucker! But I did like the looks of it, and it drove without a hiccup or any funny sounds or smells. To me, it seems that if average retail is $8800, they should take $7000-7500 without a protest, and I don't know that they won't because I haven't even tried yet. But I am not sure there is any point making a $7000 offer on a car stickered at $10,9. Am I just wasting my time?

BTW, I hear you on the $6K-ish offer, but I certainly feel like the car would be worth it if I could get it for $7K. It is a nice car with CARFAX and a 3-month B2B warranty included at that price. I figure with a little care it will give me five or six years without a problem, and besides, by then I will probably have gotten bored and traded anyway! :-P"

I told him a $7500 price would prevent me from looking anywhere else, knowing he would say ""go look elsewhere"", which is exactly what he did! He hinted they would probably take an offer in the $9K range. I dunno, at $9K I would take a pass. At $8K, it would still be in the running.

My money is also on the TSX 6-sp."

4980	December 30, 2005 7:42PM	nippononly	I hope anony didn't trade that beautiful Lexus for another used Tercel! :-P
4981	December 30, 2005 9:35PM	woodyww	A new Civic Si.
4982	December 30, 2005 9:48PM	woodyww	"*He says they use KBB to govern their purchase price*

Yeah, right. Take a 100K, 8 y.o. Accord with dings & scuffed alloys to them & see what they'll pay--I bet their whole attitude changes drastically. Suddenly, it'll be a $5K car, they're not worth as much as used Accords in Michigan, or Lithuania, yada yada.

I think you're lucky they turned down your $7500. You can buy a brand new base Accord for what, $18K (I think), or brand new Civic for around that. So $7500 for a 100K, 8 y.o. one just doesn't compute somehow.....

P.S. Don't just go on what the books say. Ask Terry on the RWTIV board, or there are other people here who seem to know the values of cheaper, older cars. I really overpaid for a used Honda once 'cause I bought it on a whim, then it needed shocks, & had paint issues, & I think I ate about $2.5k when I sold it a year or 2 later.....for something I paid $5.6K for......"

Kind of as I figured, the Mrs. letting me go car shopping was a little bit of a tease. I had all sorts of cool things on my short list to choose from. But not to be at the immediate moment. I'm going to be all grown up and responsible and pay down the Home Eq Line of Credit some with the spare cash. Significantly more fiscally responsible, but way less fun.

BTW, my bet is on a new Civic Si as well, if it wasn't a TL of TSX."
4984	December 31, 2005 4:49AM	jaserb	"Amen, Woody. They all break. Honda, Toyota, or Hyundai. They're made of metal and glass, rubber and plastic. For my $7,500 I'd take an '03 Sonata or Taurus with 40k miles and maybe even some warranty left way before a 100k mile Honda. Shocks, timing belts, clutches, belts and hoses - even if nothing ""major"" breaks all that stuff has a limited life expectancy, and costs $$$.

4985	December 31, 2005 5:56AM	gee35coupe	"But we ended up buying.....
Actually Anony ended up buying.....
...
...
Our Accord. She paid off the lease and we are gonna drive it a least until the 08's come out. We are coming up on our mileage cap pretty quickly so we decided we might as well go ahead and buy out the lease before interest rates climb any further.

Those Civic Si guesses were pretty good though. The only problem is that I can't drive the new Civic. That funky parking brake lever digs into my leg."
4986	December 31, 2005 5:47PM	woodyww	"That's a trick question.....you bought your own car, &.....so?? Maybe I'll sign the title to my bmw over to myself today.....&, then, ""guess what bmw I just bought""?"
4987	December 31, 2005 6:43PM	mark156	"Just saw a new Honda Civic coupe... wow, what a nice looking car! They have come a long way in style!

I don't really follow Honda's and I had to take a second look at the black beauty that was before me. I would have never thought that was a Civic.. it looks a lot bigger than past Civic's.

Mark"
4988	December 31, 2005 7:52PM	anonymousposts	"but technically I did buy the Accord from Gee. Same situation as last time. We looked at everything available and came to the conclusion the Accord was yet again the best deal. We even called our local Acura dealer to find a white TL 6-speed but he had none available. We would've bought a new Si but Gee isn't comfortable. After driving a 05 RX330 we thought about buying one but by the end of our time with it we decided the MDX was a better vehicle for us. Also thought about trading the Accord and the MDX for a new MDX Touring with NAV and DVD player. In the end, we decided we are better off with what we have right now.

The new Si is awesome. It makes the 01-05 Civic look just plain boring. Even more boring than it was before. Honda brought the Civic line up to the standards the 93-95 and the 96-00 generations set."
4989	December 31, 2005 8:26PM	gee35coupe	Just trying to stimulate discussion here. Don't be so literal.
4990	December 31, 2005 11:22PM	mark156	"Anony and Gee... it's really amazing how many cars that you have had over the years. I like to get new cars too but I like to enjoy them and ""bond"" with them. :blush:

Can't wait to see what you guys get next!

Mark"
4991	January 1, 2006 1:32AM	stickguy	"quick question: Did you do any suspension upgrades on the Accord, or just your previous Si? I was thinking about a basic suspension kit (to firm up the handling a bit, just to up the ""sport"" quotient), and was wondering what was available and makes sense to do.

I looked at HandA, and they had a nice package listed for ~$450 (springs/shocks I think), but it said for the V6 only.

Might not do anything, but I figure that customizing it a bit will keep me interested, and help us become as one.

I will probably get the lip spoiler when it warms up, assuming installation isn't going to be too much, just to give it some flavor.

Amazingly nice car to drive, but it wouldn't hurt to be firmed up a bit."
4992	January 1, 2006 4:28AM	woodyww	I get so excited when someone's buying a new car that it's a let down if they don't. And I thought there might be a prize for whoever guessed what you or anon bought. A new set of high performance tires or something.
4993	January 1, 2006 4:51AM	woodyww	"I was reading the fairly rave review of the new Si in R&T the day before you posted about buying a car. If I felt like blowing $20K-something on a 2nd car, it would at least be on my list. Knowing myself tho, I'd go out to buy a new Honda, but somehow it would mysteriously turn into buying a used bmw.

BTW, you do have a pretty nice collection of cars there already....."
4994	January 2, 2006 12:08AM	anonymousposts	"No suspension mods on the Accord. Since it was lease we really didn't want to do too much to it. However, now that it's ours a nice set of 17"" wheels couldn't be too far off. Just have to wait for the OEM Michelins to wear out. We will probably lower it a bit when we put wheels on it. Gee has always went with Eibachs so I'm sure that's where he will look when the time comes.

How do you like the Accord so far? Do you miss the Scion?"
4995	January 2, 2006 12:09AM	anonymousposts	The Si is a bargain IMO. I will try to drive one soon. No local dealers seem to have them in stock right now.
4996	January 2, 2006 12:15AM	stickguy	"so far, I like it. Only have about 115 miles though, since 2 days after I got it we left for Xmas at the family, so it sat for over a week.

Did use it for shopping trip yesterday. It drives nice, and is growing on me. Can't wait to get it out on some open roads to let it stretch the old legs.

Washed and waxed it today (finishing the prep job the dealer should have done), and discovered that the tries were a bit low (ditto about the prep job), so that firmed up the handling a bit. Real comfortable ride, and a great interior.

Love the XM too. Don't miss the Scion at all really.

I think I will throw on the spoiler, but I doubt I will do anything with the suspension (took much effort, and not really cheap). Handles well enough fro normal around town use, and I don't plan to auto-X with it!"
4997	January 2, 2006 4:18PM	akangl	Whoa, I must have been gone for a while! Stick you got rid of your Scion????? What did you buy?? I'm quickly losing my place in the CCBA forum!!! I really need to buy something but have no desire to car shop.....am I sick???
4998	January 2, 2006 8:22PM	woodyww	"I think he bought a new '05 Accord 5 sp(?). (I'm living vicariously thru the car buying exploits of others right now, so all I have to talk about is other people's purchases).

I don't think you're sick. Car shopping/buying can become a stressful (& expensive!) drag sometimes.......btw, how's Texas?"
4999	January 2, 2006 9:30PM	gee35coupe	"I'll probably go with the Eibachs when I decide to upgrade. And I hear the TL's sway bar is a direct fit. So I'm gonna look into that.

I ebayed a set of 20's for the MDX. A set of Gianelle Flush 10's. I got em for $600. Not bad for a set of new wheels. The tires are gonna cost more than the wheels.

The Lexus is purring like a kitten now. I need to get a few suspension bits replaced and she'll be good as new."
