Certainly my T&C did not go into limp mode when the O2 sensor failed. And down through the years, I have helped quite a few with bad O2 sensors, and I do not recall any of them going into limp mode.

And ""would not drive"" does not compute. ""Limp mode"" is short hand for ""limp home mode"". The car will still drive, but you will have reduced power.

I suspect your ""friend"" misrepresented things."

Think I mentioned that I WFH full-time and when we bought our house 18 months ago, the plan was to use the “formal” dining room as my office. Only problem was it wasn’t enclosed and I’ve just had things in the open. 

3 months ago we custom ordered a set of French doors to enclose the office that would allow us to retain the natural light we get through the window in that room and match the house like it was from new. 

May not seem like much, but trying to find doors to fit a nearly 8x8 opening is harder than you’d think.

10	June 11, 2019 2:55AM	mb_enthusiast	I went to check out a 2016 Cayenne GTS, 2019 Cayenne S, and 2019 Macan S. I hated the 2016 Cayenne GTS. I felt that the 2019 Cayenne S was a ripoff and didn't handle much better than my Q8 or really much of anything else on that platform, but definitely better than the 2016 Cayenne. I really liked the Macan S. Are Porsches worth it?

14	June 11, 2019 3:49AM	stickguy	"nice looking doors. We have a similar set up (standard center hall colonial) where the ""formal"" LR is to the right as you come in the door, behind the stairs, with the opening, well, open. Useless room. We have a desk (and desktop PC) that we never use, and a couch that gets sat on at Thanksgiving maybe. Would be much better set-up like yours, with doors to create an office space. Even though it is probably 2x as big as it needs to be. If I was able to redesign it, I would make it a more compact office in the front, and add the rest to the family room that is behind it.

easier to just move of course and get what I want!"

16	June 11, 2019 3:53AM	corvette	"Same, even though I file single--that's going to be a common refrain for a lot of the middle class. Really reduces the potential value of the mortgage interest deduction for a lot of people. On the other hand, my fixed interest rate on my primary residence is something like 3.75%, so not awful even if it's not deductible.

A lot of the state-specific deductions in our fair state's income tax got eliminated in 2018, too.

Looking at the last few years of my late, widowed, great-aunt's tax returns, she paid around $6-7,000 in federal taxes and close to zero state with an AGI of about $55,000 consisting of mostly taxable SS benefits, interest income, a pension, and some state tax-exempt bonds. My goal is zero fed and state tax by the time I stop working and draw SS... fortunately, I have quite a long time to plan that!"

@nyccarguy Cute kid!

@corvette Zero taxes? Hilarious. The KY state changes have definitely not helped seniors. My 91 yr old uncle owed state income taxes for the first time in years. Also, once RMDs hit when you are 70? If you've been a big saver and user of 401K and traditional IRAs, you are going to get a huge tax bill, each year. I'm starting to see why so many people move to FL, where there is no state income tax. Still trying to figure that out (but, nine years left until RMDs)"

RMD's I think have to start once one is 70 and 1/2 but would have to ask my CPA wife to find out for sure. I just hope I make it to that age so I can start pulling out some funds. Looking to start putting more into muni bonds so if I do pass earlier than I'd like, the kids will have something. Not really necessary to leave them anything, but since my grandma and dad did for me, feel I should do the same for my 3 no matter how large or small. Since I'll be turning 65 later this year, have a lot to think about such as Medicare and deciding how long I stay at Hertz. Thinking that mid 2020 might just be the right time to make a quiet exit.
And hoping to move by the end of 2020 or early 2021 up to central or southwest Florida. Getting way to crowded down here...been here almost 50 years!"

25	June 11, 2019 2:40PM	corvette	@kyfdx I’ve been doing Roth conversions for a while. Didn’t do any last year because my income was abnormally high, but every little bit helps. They are talking about raising the RMD age to 72. 
26	June 11, 2019 3:02PM	kyfdx	"We've been doing some Roth conversions. Unfortunately, KY dropped the exemption for retirement income from $41K to $31K. I can still fit some conversion in that window, without triggering state income taxes, but my wife's pension puts her over the limit. That reduces some of the incentive for doing that.

Federal income taxes are very low, in general. But, if you get a big investment return in one year, it just kills you."

The Medicare issue is complex as my government health insurance is a secondary insurance, not a supplemental kind. My wife is under my insurance and always has been, and always will. Have been told that since I've started taking my s s benefits, I'd be automatically enrolled in Medicare. But thinking I'd like to put it off a year until she she turns 65, and then both of us use Medicare. Since my current health insurance is a secondary one, kind of muddies up the waters so just not sure what to do at this juncture? Guess being a retired federal employee under civil service complicates things. All I know is that once I pass, she'll get my pension though at a reduced percentage, probably half, as I recall. Filled out so much paperwork back then that it's hard to remember it all."

39	June 11, 2019 10:12PM	corvette	We’re at 3100 pages of CCBA discussion. My first car had a GM 3100 V6. That engine didn’t have the following that the 3800 did, but you could hear the pushrods thrashing around just as well.

42	June 12, 2019 11:43AM	nyccarguy	At the end of March 2017, I purchased my 2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD as a CPO car.  The person who leased it originally drove only 7,468 miles in 2 1/2 years.  I have put significantly more miles on it since then.  
43	June 12, 2019 11:53AM	qbrozen	"Is that the only car you drive?

miles like that is why I have my wife in more than one vehicle."
44	June 12, 2019 11:55AM	au1994	I've driven quite a few of the 3.8 GM engines and while it may be loud and a little rough, it makes good power. My mom had a Cutlass Ciera with it and that would move nicely when driven by a 17 year old.
45	June 12, 2019 11:58AM	tjc78	"I just looked at the miles on the Enclave (it's usually hidden, by miles to empty) and we just crossed 20. Sept is 2 years so pretty much on point with the 12K /yr lease.

The Elantra still hasn't crossed 17K and goes back in November.... guess we should drive that one more.

Wife has been using that for her 10 mile round trip commute to the train. She likes how easy it is to park. So, I have been mostly driving the Enclave. As nice and comfortable as that thing is I just prefer a car."
46	June 12, 2019 12:30PM	ab348	My only experience with the 3800 was in my first-gen Lacrosse and it disappointed me. But I concluded that was due to a faulty transmission they never did get fixed properly and which led me to unload the thing. I based that on the performance of a loaner Lacrosse with the same engine I got one time the dealer was tearing my transmission apart again. The loaner was much more zippy than my car.
47	June 12, 2019 12:46PM	stickguy	"my TLX turns 6 months old (time flies!) next week. Should be sitting right about 4,000 miles by then. The Sonata went back at the end of the 3 year lease with 20.500 on it. The RDX turns 7 in September, and that is still just under 54,000.

we need to get out more!"
48	June 12, 2019 1:58PM	nyccarguy	"@qbrozen

Pretty much. Since I had the clutch replaced last year for a tidy sum (It is almost time for the 2nd timing belt replacement and my tires are shot), I've pretty much kept my Prelude parked. Also I have to park on the street here at work and I know one day it is going to get hit (It is inevitable, like Thanos). I could take my wife's Pilot a few days per week. Besides the miles, the Q40 sucks down 93 at a rate of less than 20 mpg. Gas is expensive in CT and I'm filling up to the tune of about $57 - $60 once a week (ish).

Ideally I'd be looking to get into a 2 year lease of something where they don't kill you if you go over the miles or let you buy the miles in advance at a significant discount. I've toyed in my head to see if it would be financially advantageous to lease 2 cars with 10K per year, but that's way more expensive than leasing a car and paying for the extra miles up front. I'm open to suggestions as always!

Part of the reason I was looking at the Tacoma is due to the fact that I could take out a 12K per year lease in order to take advantage of the high residual value, put down the MSD (which lowers the monthly payment by about $50/month), and then use the MSD to pay for the extra 16,000 miles (plus the disposition fee) I'd drive during the 2 year lease (TFS only charges $.15 per mile if you go over) when I turn it in at the end of the lease.

If I were to take a 15,000 mile per year lease on a car that charges $.25 per mile over, then I would go over my miles (and likely be out of warranty at some point during the lease). It would cost me an extra $3,750 over 3 years (plus tax) or $104.17 per month. On a 2 year/15,000 mile per year lease, I'd only go over my miles by 10,000 which would cost me the same $104.17 per month, but $2,500 total."

53	June 12, 2019 3:05PM	28firefighter	@nyccarguy From my perspective, the miles you put on is one small piece of the puzzle. The other piece of this is that you basically live in whatever you drive for hours each day. For better or worse, you need to put a high priority on the things that make a car livable for you for that period of time - performance, comfort, reliability, etc. While it certainly has it's faults, the Q40 seems to check a lot of the right boxes.
54	June 12, 2019 3:09PM	tjc78	I wouldn't mind a Q sedan at all. I know people knock the technology but it's not that bad and certainly can't be worse than my Enclave.
55	June 12, 2019 3:54PM	sda	I think your Intrigue with the 3.5 Shortstar spoiled you. It may not have had the torque down low, but it was smooth, quick and had a nice sound when spurred.
56	June 12, 2019 3:59PM	stickguy	"Bradd, the Honcker deal earlier this year was perfect for you. Fusion hybrid (Titanium or limited, not sure, but all loaded up with goodies). Fantastic mileage, and plenty comfy for commuting.

I forget if it was 24 or 36 months, but I know that for 18,000 miles/year, with basically 1st payment DAS, it came out to be $225ish a month. Heck, the gas savings alone would half pay for it. I would have snapped it up if I hadn't just gotten the TLX, and could have let the princess burn 10K a year on her long commute to keep miles off her car.

that was a deal i have not really seen repeated."
57	June 12, 2019 4:08PM	nyccarguy	I could not agree more!

60	June 12, 2019 4:20PM	au1994	Well the Tacoma V-6 is rated at 19/24 and it runs regular. Wonder what the real world numbers are.
61	June 12, 2019 4:23PM	andres3	"If there's one thing I've learned from being an active participant and reader on a car club social media venue for Audi's, is that Audi owner's will try to find a way to skimp and save a few bucks on their $40-60K value car. This includes maintenance, and getting shoddy Chinese parts, or taking chances on suspect parts. In fact, I think the awesome reputable shop I use make a significant chunk of their revenue from re-fixing others' fixes, including other shops' fixes. Joe Schmoe mechanics often lead to rework at my shop.

I truly wonder how many Audi's have suffered at the hands of either neglect or incompetence. I remember being quoted Multi ATF fluid for my DSG transmission that requires a DSG OIL. The test drive at a Lemon Grove Used Car dealer on the '06 A3 wouldn't surprise me if the transmission had the wrong fluid instead of the right oil."
62	June 12, 2019 4:29PM	nyccarguy	I'll have to drive an X2 to see if I could hack a 24/15K deal on a loaner. Those are intriguing.

My very trusted Mercedes-Benz/Euro mechanic thinks the dealer I brought it from is bad news. They're a used luxury dealership. Used luxury dealers are a prolific species in my area—and I've only seen one with good reviews—and this one wasn't it.

It was a 2013 Cayenne GTS with less than 40k miles. It looked suspiciously worn on the interior. Although, I looked at one at a Porsche dealership from 2016 that looked much the same and had about 20k more miles. Do Porsche interiors wear well?

This one was covered in Alcantara, and there were some stains, especially on the driver's door. Less than 40k miles and two owners, the last owner having it repossessed seems shady to me. I've test driven a car that clearly had the miles rolled back. This one raised suspicions too, given the two owners, nearly seven years of age, and registration in two different states 1400 miles apart.

The car drove beautifully and felt so powerful. It still felt big, but it was very confident. My test drive was solo, and I think I get a better feel for cars when given that opportunity. I wasn't impressed when test driving new Cayenne Ss and a Macan S—especially not for $108k and $81k respectively. Porsches lack such basic features for their high price tags. It's unbelievable to me. It's the only German marque available in the U.S. that I haven't owned."
80	June 13, 2019 12:49AM	stickguy	they are big and heavy. And IMO someone that is going to let it get repossessed is also not spending the large sums required for routine and preventive maintenance.
81	June 13, 2019 12:58AM	mb_enthusiast	"Agreed. Also, having connections to financial services and a family background in subprime lending, I know that a lot of people let cars get repossessed when they cannot afford or are unwilling to pay for the repairs and maintenance required. I think many people would be amazed at how common that is.

At the same time, my Phaeton had been repossessed and was in pretty good shape and only had 84k miles by the time I sold it last year."

I would have thought this would be $10K more than $58K. Wondering how it’s equipped. But, given you could probably negotiate it down to less than $55K, that’s quite appealing."

118	June 14, 2019 3:53PM	henryn	Carmax eats up a solid 2 hours of my time, driving there and back and waiting for them to inspect. A few years ago, it was worth it. These days, their offers tend to be too low.

Carvana and Vroom both offered $21K or higher for the Outback recently. CarMax offered $19,500, and the Subaru dealers keep telling me to trade it in, at a guaranteed value of $18,600.

It helps that I have a CarMax less than 10 minutes from me. About 30 minutes for the inspection and quote."
120	June 14, 2019 4:06PM	andres3	Carmax likes cars deemed to be ultra reliable by the buying public. They love Civics and Corollas, they don't much care for Audi's, and I think that would go for domestic iron as well.
121	June 14, 2019 4:18PM	stickguy	Carmax also ponies up for real low miles. so a Sube with 10K on it should be desirable. But with them, you never know.
122	June 14, 2019 4:19PM	suydam	@Sandman6472, Apple has instructions on their website on how to do this. Follow the instructions as though you were doing a trade in through their program. Or just use their trade in program. It’s a pretty decent one. That’s what I did with my old MacBook. They send you the box and label to ship it off and then send you a check once they inspect it.

I don't dally with it, though, so I use full assist on the hills to keep as much momentum as possible.

It's a great workout, though not debilitating like it was with my last bike (which was very similar to this, but without the electric assist). The total ride takes about 40 minutes each way (compared to about 25 minutes by car)."

My preferred Mercedes dealership, where the car had been sitting disabled for two weeks offered me only $3k for the 2011 car. It was in significant disrepair, obviously, no doubt. However, before the front right air strut and motor went out, they had offered me $5k. CarMax had appraised it for $7k that same week.

Fast forward to the collapse, the Mercedes dealership was able to lock the strut in place so that I could drive it to CarMax for another appraisal. CarMax reiterated its $7k offer.

The vast majority of dealerships I contacted with while shopping were willing to match CarMax sight unseen. AutoNation also matched them. One Audi dealership even agreed to beat CarMax and AutoNation by $500. $3k vs $7k is a big difference to me...

However, when I was selling my Phaeton, they offered me only $4k and I ended up selling it on eBay for $7k."

Also, since the wife had just bought her A3 the week before, she opened the door to buying German and the rest is history.

Don't mind doing that extra day but not every week, every other week could work or better, every 3 weeks.

Unfortunately Carmax is calling over 42 people's bluffs and not lowering the price on the red S4 we are all watching and waiting for them to drop the price on. It's been on their San Jose lot's location for quite some time without a price drop.

I think watching and ""favoriting"" the car hurts us (us being the 42 plus that have Favorited it). Less than 28K miles on a '15, as soon as they price drop-it; it'll sell. As long as we don't keep pinging their algorithm to hold off on the price drop because we keep looking at the website.

Two biggest flaws are:

1) NO Nappa Leather
2) NO B&O sound system

Though the Taurus was the top of line LX also with sunroof, she never liked it as much as she did her Oldsmobile’s.

191	June 17, 2019 3:29PM	fintail	My grandma's Olds was also replaced by a Taurus. She also commented about the hood ornament, and the trunk height compared to her prior car.

194	June 17, 2019 8:16PM	marcogallo1986	 Good to know about all of the above everybody commented on the software in these forums. How was everyone’s weekend? Yesterday just went to my grandmothers, then went to go visit my grandfather at the cemetery, six years since he passed. Yesterday, and we had a little barbecue, and my dad met us there since my parents are divorced, I’ve been for 14 years. Saturday I wanted to go to a car show, but I had no one to drive the car for me oh well there’s always another one, I’ve gone to a cruise night last Wednesday or usually go to started up couple four weeks ago   With my younger cousin and his friend, didn’t see anyone that I knew but whatever if they don’t come up to me and I don’t see them enough to recognize their voice I never would know they’re there anyway. Still job searching going to the gym twice a week enjoying life. 
195	June 17, 2019 8:18PM	marcogallo1986	 See everybody how pretty much perfect that comment above I just brought walas, have to make this a habit and just take my time and not rush and talk super super slow, and make sure there’s no noise around me.  Lol lol

203	June 18, 2019 12:37AM	omarman	"Jarring sight of the '68 Cougar and Toyota Corona staged in front of a 70MPH speed limit changed to oil crisis ""55"" signage. Got my first ride in a new Cougar in 1967 and loved it. By 1974 I got my first ride in a Corona which surprised me by being a likable little compact. But I was still sure back then that German imports would dominate the Honda and Toyota efforts."
204	June 18, 2019 12:48AM	corvette	"FWIW, I saw nothing in the museum discussing Ford's anti-Semitism, but there is this on their website:
https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-resources/popular-topics/henry-ford-and-anti-semitism-a-complex-story

Side note, I really detest it when institutions try to paper over unsavory parts of their past - I saw the same issues at the Hoover Dam tour (which glossed over the many workers who died) and visiting Bletchley Park (which pretty much ignored Alan Turing's suicide, which was almost certainly caused by his persecution and criminal conviction due to his sexual orientation)."
205	June 18, 2019 12:50AM	corvette	My dad's first car was a burgundy 1968 Cougar, so I immediately sent him that picture!
206	June 18, 2019 12:55AM	ab348	"The challenges automakers faced with the advent of govt safety regulations in the late ‘60s/early ‘70s were really very significant. I found this film recently which was quite interesting and featured some familiar names from Ford Design in the early ‘70s, like Gene Bordinat and Homer LaGassey. Some of the design and engineering challenges they describe are fascinating.

Change by Design

The reporter is Dave Diles, who I remember as the host of the Prudential College Football Scoreboard Show on ABC during late Saturday fall afternoons in the early-mid 1970s."
207	June 18, 2019 12:55AM	corvette	Also, the G37 has again been wonderful on this trip. The tires and suspension adequately handle the beat-up Michigan pavement, the transmission is quick to respond (even though I've not kept it in sport mode, as @nyccarguy does). It's much quicker to kick down for passing than the Mustang was. Engine braking on downhill stretches is very good. The steering doesn't require many corrections. The seat is very comfortable. I appreciate having a grab handle on the driver's side on longer drives, as it's handy for stretching.
208	June 18, 2019 1:11AM	sda	Our neighbors had a 69 Corona, same color, just like the one in picture #4. It was a Toyoglide with ac, a real hot rod.

Are there people for hire that'll go look at a car for a few bucks? You really have to do an ""Italian"" tune up and hoon the Audi to make sure it works right.

There's a blue S4 in Henderson, but more miles on that one."
213	June 18, 2019 3:14AM	stickguy	Mr. Shiftright is in that area and does inspections. Really for classic cars, but if it isn't something he would handle, he certainly can recommend someone.

216	June 18, 2019 4:06AM	nyccarguy	It seems like you are getting rid of your TTS which you love due to the escalating insurance rates.  Up until about 5 years ago, I was always given 1 quote for insuring the Prelude then was always asked:  “Wait.  Do you have?” And I would reply:  “Yes.  It is a Type SH.”  Which for the longest time had a higher rate.  Nobody likes to give insurance companies their hard earned money.  Just pay to play.  I’m guessing you can afford it.  If you don’t pay your insurance company the extra $800 per year (which i will admit is A LOT), then you are going to spend it on some random repair on this used S4 you seek out.  Of if you really want to ditch the TTS for another S4, then lease a new one that suits your specs.

219	June 18, 2019 12:49PM	nyccarguy	"I'm still running the factory 17s. The dealer that I bought from swapped out the original tires (after only 7,468 miles) with a set of Hankook Ventus S1 Noble2. They are still in good shape. They perform OK, but nothing to write home about.

Pirelli PZero Nero GT's get good reviews as do BF Goodrich G-Force Comp-2 A/S.

I find the car doesn't transition between lanes as well as I'd like, especially on choppy pavement. It does ""axle hop"" over expansion joints. I've read that an upgraded rear anti-roll car works wonders for keeping the car planted. The stock upgraded rear anti-roll bar from the ""IPL"" cars fit as well as from Stillen & Hotchkis."
220	June 18, 2019 12:57PM	nyccarguy	There is also an Audi Dealer who posts on Lease Hackr that's in Southern California. Maybe you can get in touch with him and he'll keep an eye out for anything incoming (new or off lease).

Couple of cool volvos and BMWs we don’t get in the US, such as the new v40 and the 1-series hatch (looks much like the old clownshoe z3. By far, the best looking all around as a company has to be Peugeot. Love the sedans, hatches, wagons, and even small SUVs. We wound up with a lowly Opel van as our chariot for the stay. Its not awful. And the “i would totally export that home” award goes to the Lada Niva. Absolutely LOVED looking at this one at the gas station.

228	June 18, 2019 4:41PM	stickguy	Had to look up the niva. You can sorta buy one here (used). It was the basis for the Suzuki Vitara.
229	June 18, 2019 4:45PM	Sandman6472	"The Golf's sitting at the VW store right now, $138 just to look at it and will be applied to any fix they do. A bit much but have to do something if I ever intend to sell it. Was looking at their used stuff and found a nice 2016 EOS and a 2015 EOS, the '15 model having the better audio system but the '16 a better color combo. Have always liked them and passed on a brown over beige beauty there a few years back, a big mistake!
Brought it in around 9:30 and besides calling me to tell me they found my keys, nothing. Hopefully they'll find the issue and I'll get out of there for not much more than the $138. Besides upkeep and tires, first real money I've spent on it since new. A battery, air filter, new wiper blades, tires and oil changes are just things one must do to maintain any vehicle over time. The other issues I've had were all covered by warranty so this is the first I've spent out of the ordinary on it.
But, next time, want something with a longer warranty."
230	June 18, 2019 4:48PM	xwesx	How many miles on it again?
231	June 18, 2019 5:01PM	Sandman6472	"Henry Ford wasn't to bright to libel a group of Americans like he did and I know it effected the cars our family bought for many years. My grandparents would never own a Ford product though my folks leased a '66 Lincoln Continental and bought a '72 Lincoln Continental and a '72 Ford Torino GT, one of the worst operating vehicles we ever owned. I drove it home from the dealership and never made it as it had to be towed back to the dealer within a few miles. The '72 Mustang loaner we had for a few weeks is what they should've bought!
We never ever thought about buying any German vehicle until a few years back when we finally decided to give it a try. Hell, they're both made in Mexico!
But Henry was just plain dumb to alienate a certain group of folks who probably bought a lot of vehicles. Why would any businessman do something like that and it's still being discussed years later. Just seems foolish, but all hate is foolish...something we have to teach because it's not born within us.
And a dumb mayor who by his actions made it bigger than it had to be. And whatever point he was trying to make has been lost and just makes him look ignorant. Sure, it was a stupid move on his part but just showed his ignorance for the world to see!"

238	June 18, 2019 6:25PM	qbrozen	I found on wiki that it “inspired” the suzuki, but have not found a direct connection. Any source on that? That one I took a pic of seems to be maybe a ‘91, which predates the grand vitara by quite a bit. 
239	June 18, 2019 6:27PM	qbrozen	Honestly, very very easy. hairiest part was today when I tried to take us through the winding streets surrounding a castillo. I came to a dead end and had to make a u-turn on a street barely wider than the van is long. Yikes. 
240	June 18, 2019 6:49PM	Sandman6472	"Just called with the bad news. It's in need of a new cable and another part which is not in stock. Gonna order it and will come back on Thursday to have it fixed. No sense missing work tomorrow when they can't promise it'll be done tomorrow afternoon as the part won't be in till after 1 pm. They said come pick it up and the $138 will be applied to the $570 plus tax bill! I'm in shock right now and times like these I wish I had a toy that could be used when the other two can't be used!
Kinda sucks because it didn't always happen but eventually, it would have had to be fixed. So, bite the bullet now, or later on down the road. Hopefully this will be it until the end of 2019 and can possibly trade it in on a new 2020 model later on this year. Not the best scenario but one that'll have to do for the moment."

I ain't giving up on the TTS just yet!!! AIN is a word, LOL!

I'm trading in the Alltrack for the S4 (should I move forward with this intoxicating plan!).

That way it's not much more money, and I get a car I always wanted vs. what my wife wanted and no longer wants (Alltrack). Not only can I get the S4 I always liked, and had a good experience with, but I can buy an undamaged one.... except....

Now I find out the rear bumpers been bashed twice on the Richmond CA random used car dealer Misano Red S4; hence the lower price tag. They claim the report says minor and rear bumper for both incidents. IF you have to take a hit, the rear's the spot to take it.... and of course the salesman says the car is a 9/10 with great rear bumper body work (can't even tell he says). Need to confirm it's one owner so far.... Also, this car has had a birthday at this dealer according to the Edmunds app (good app), due to greedy asking prices in the past (way down now).

The San Jose Carmax red S4 is holding its price, but that one doesn't have the sound system upgrade (BIG VALUE), nor the supercharged badges upgrade (SMALL but of value to me). On the plus side, it has like 7K less miles, but on the negative side two owners but no accidents on the report.

I'm debating taking the TTS off full insurance coverage to save $1,000/year. I have 6-months more payments, the bank will balk at me self-insuring, and the rate is 1.49%!!! Might not want to pay off a rate that low 6-mo. early. On the other hand, that rate isn't worth 500 bucks for 6 months. Still sleeping on this one.... I can keep comprehensive and still save huge...."
247	June 19, 2019 1:10AM	andres3	"My problem is I insist on an appropriate colored S4 (or any car for that matter). That means my next car will not be white, black, or any shade of gray/silver. That pretty much means I need to find a needle in a haystack when looking at Audi's.

My insistence and inflexibility on color might be a good reason to pay the Carmax premium. Their model is good for people like me, and they come with a 30-day warranty. Trust me, I'll make sure if something's going to break, it'll break in those 30 days of hard life for the S4, and the bonus is I'll have a lot of fun trying to break it like I stole it!"

And I'm with you on being particular about the colors, though I would extend that to interior as well. Not a fan of the two-tone leather interiors that were available in those S4s. Mine was all black, which I thought was sharp. Also had the layered wood trim which was beautiful. Looked like a nice pin-stripe suit!

And I'm a sucker for the black optic package.

But of course, you put all that together, and you're quickly narrowing your search to unicorn levels."

Still seems to drive OK considering. And he’s not thorough thorough on the maintenance but he should be except for the oriole is on top of that. But the other fluids he neglects a bit, I think he change the transmission fluid ones at 50,000 miles   But he hasn’t done it sense, from time to time I would Yellit him about that. But what can you do can only suggest, how to get on my brother soon with his 2013 Ultima in changing the coolant in transmission fluid, he’s had that car for three years now ready, think he still has under 50,000 have to ask him later too. And probably next year will get on my sister to do that with her jeep to as well I think it has around 30,000 miles on it now, maybe a little less.

The Richmond salesman was honest; I looked at the reports now (although that one was Autocheck). One of the two said rear collision/ or rear damage.... the other was less certain....

So what is an S4 specd out how you like it new? $58 - $60K? Even if the lease program stinks (which it probably does) and the residual after 3 years 15K is 50%, then You'll be spending about $30K over the next 3 years for a brand new S4 with no stories & completely under warranty."

I'm having a mid-life crisis attack - got it in my head that a nice coupe would be good to have.

Search on cars.com, and I get a whole bunch of Challengers, Camaros, Mustangs and Civics.

However, I did find a 2014 A5 in a nice burgundy over grey. 50,000 miles for $18,500.

273	June 19, 2019 5:09PM	au1994	That's a good looking Audi. I test drove one of that vintage and really liked it but 1) it didn't lease as well as the 3 series 2) I drove the F30 3 series with the turbo I6 first and couldn't pass up that power.

275	June 19, 2019 5:27PM	28firefighter	I have the bug. There is a 440i xDrive GC for sale (former loaner) that is equipped exactly how I would order it not too far from me. I qualify for 7750 in lease incentives...20% off and 7750 in lease incentives would go a loooong way.

277	June 19, 2019 5:34PM	xwesx	Oh, okay. Not that many, then. I thought perhaps you were getting some strut wear that might be reducing their rebound rate when hitting rough edges like that. I wouldn't think it would be that noticeable at only 50,000 miles.
278	June 19, 2019 5:39PM	xwesx	For as much as you drive, why not?
279	June 19, 2019 5:43PM	nyccarguy	No. The struts still have lots of life left in them. I noticed these tendencies from day 1. My Prelude does an incredible job at lane transition and nothing upsets it mid corner. My E90 328Xi was unflappable in this regard as well. Once I added the upgraded rear sway bar to my Legacy, its high speed handling improved as well.

286	June 19, 2019 7:20PM	marcogallo1986	@ Breld, if your brother doesn’t sell the truck to your nephew, you can usually put it on craigslist for $10,000, my brother bought one of those a number of years ago but it was a 2004 thank you was 10,000 except for a bunch of years open till couple of years back and sold it with 200 and something thousand miles on it still running, think the bust was getting worse though, and had a few transmission leaks but it was good.

291	June 19, 2019 7:35PM	henryn	Assuming the truck is clean, in good condition, I would agree with you that the $3,200 is completely unrealistic. I also think $10k is probably too high. A lot is going to depend on condition and appearance.
292	June 19, 2019 7:55PM	pensfan83	I sold my granfather's truck several months ago, 2005 F-150 King Ranch w/30K on it for $10,500. I think $10K would be a stretch on an 18 y/o truck too but assuming it's 4x4 and in Colorado someone might pay up. Toyota trucks and Wranglers fetch crazy prices on the used market.

298	June 19, 2019 8:52PM	nyccarguy	"Porsche Problems:

So last week my Mom tells me that passenger side front carpeting on her 2016 Cayenne was soaked. She thought maybe a bottle of water spilled, but then felt water spraying on her while she was driving. I told her that her A/C drains were most likely clogged and would need to be drained out. She took the car to Porsche the next day, they gave her a 2018 Macan to drive as a loaner, and confirmed my suspicions. Drains are clogged and the carpeting has to be removed so the vehicle can dry out properly.

The next day they call and tell us they found the low speed grinding noise she's been complaining about for quite some time. Transfer case is shot and needs to be replaced. $2,500. Whoa! Hold on there pal! Wasn't that replaced under warranty not that long ago? ""I'll get back to you.""

Guy calls me back the next day and said they replaced the transfer case at 55,000 miles out of warranty as a ""Goodwill Gesture."" Since it was replaced out of warranty as a Goodwill Gesture, it is not covered under their 2 year unlimited mile ""parts warranty."" He spoke to Porsche Corporate and they said the transfer case shouldn't have gone bad again at 72,500 miles (less than a year). Porsche has offered to pay for 1/2 @ $1,250. I hang up from the dealer and call Porsche corporate myself. They open a case for me and say they'll get back to me in 2-3 business days.

I don't hear from Corporate, so I call them myself this afternoon. They tell me that they are willing to offer additional assistance, but I (I called as my Dad) will still be responsible for $876.74 plus tax. Case closed.

SO I put a call into the service manager to talk to him to tell him to go ahead with the repair. Meanwhile, my Mom has put close to 1,000 miles on the loaner Macan since last Thursday.

With the 80K service lurking on the horizon, they will most likely ditch the Cayenne. I'm going to look into leasing for them."

306	June 19, 2019 10:28PM	kyfdx	Nice, but silver-gray is not a great E46 color. We had an '05 330 convertible in that color (not a ZHP). A serious drop-off from the steel gray that preceded it.
307	June 19, 2019 10:58PM	andres3	"So what is an S4 specd out how you like it new? $58 - $60K? Even if the lease program stinks (which it probably does) and the residual after 3 years 15K is 50%, then You'll be spending about $30K over the next 3 years for a brand new S4 with no stories & completely under warranty.

I think the math works better my way than with a new car. Remember, my old S4, when you take out the wreck caused by the errant and negligent Lexus driver, was just about flawless. For 48,000 miles I'd value that warranty at about $100-$200; not worth much, and I expect more of the same. Granted, that's from 0 to 48,000, and now I'm talking 30K-80K miles. Still, pretty damn low miles for a lot less money. Lastly, a new S4 isn't that exciting to me. I like the old supercharged format on the drivetrain, and I far prefer the interior materials, layout, design, and aesthetics of the B8/8.5 to the B9 by quite a margin! At 80K miles, it'll still be worth something, whereas with the lease, I'll have nothing but a disposition fee to pay.

The B9 was supposed to be close to 300 pounds lighter, but after all the safety nannies had their way, it's only like 50 pounds lighter. I'm also not a fan of all the new safety nannies, except for maybe rear cross traffic alerts. I think B8's are the way to go!"
308	June 19, 2019 11:03PM	andres3	"To keep from going down to a Unicorn, you have to give some things up.

My other non-negotiable is Rear-Sport-Differential!!!! I think 85+% of them have it, but the one's that don't are a travesty.

The B&O audio, while not the best, was a no brainer at $850 when new.... a shame when not equipped.

The supercharged badges were overpriced, but I just never liked the V6T badge if you opt out.

I'm actuallya big fan of both the Nappa Leather, and the two-toned colored interiors, especially in red/black combo, but to each their own. The one's I'm seeing for sale lately are all black, and the base Alcantara/Leather mix. Not necessarily a bad thing as it has way more friction than Nappa leather and holds you better in the spirited twisties."
309	June 20, 2019 12:16AM	ab348	"Those Peugeots look nice, but I remember seeing some other Peugeots that were nothing short of hideous in styling.

Seems to me this is an odd thing to go bad but since I didn't get the extended warranty, it's on me. Hoping nothing else goes wrong in the next 40K miles or so. Just need to keep it running into the beginning of 2020 until those other vehicles I like have been out awhile.
312	June 20, 2019 1:10PM	nyccarguy	"Sandy

The extended warranty would have cost you a lot more than this 1 repair. Yes it stinks, but you LOVE the car and haven't had any other issues thus far."
313	June 20, 2019 2:49PM	au1994	I don;t think it exists anymore either. A regular cab full size might fit the bill, but yeah its still big. Sounds to me like what he wants is a Ranger, Toyota or Nissan from the 80's.

320	June 20, 2019 5:34PM	Sandman6472	"Yep, you're right about that. Another $470 and tax today so a bit expensive but, it works they say. Have a year warranty so that's good, though should really be till I sell it. But truth is, I do love the car, best I've ever owned I think.
On another note, while at VW, stopped in to talk to one of the big guys and just asked about employment as a shuttle driver. My service advisor told me that one of their long term drivers had recently retired and it was a bit chaotic right now. So went to see the top guy. Mentioned that I've applied either 2 or 3 times in the past by filling out an application and giving it to him! I asked him outright is my using a cane a factor in their refusal to even acknowledge my previous attempts at employment. Explained that I've been a driver at Hertz for over 5 years now but the distance is starting to become an issue. Since I live not even 5 minutes from this store, it would work out better for me to work close to him. Told me to fill out another app and give it personally to him. Naturally when I was done, I did it within 20 minutes, he was gone and was told he'd stepped out of the office for ""awhile"". My vehicle was done about 0 minutes later and after I paid, walked by his office but still, he was gone.
Not surprised one bit but we'll see. I could be a pain and keep going over there every few days but don't want to look like a nut so, will just wait and see if anything happens. I know my boss will give me a great rec if they do call and I know my cane is a negative, but I really do need it to walk at this point as my left leg is very weak from the injury. I need it for balance but driving is no problem for me.
We'll just wait and see what happens."

350	June 22, 2019 6:45PM	ab348	It actually hasn't been driven yet this year except out of the garage into the driveway for a variety of reasons to date, but it will be out and about pretty soon. We have had virtually no Spring and only in the last couple of weeks have we had more than the odd day where you would want to drive with the windows down. It's been horrible here.

I love that trip! The road through that area is particularly fun, as it still has some ""last century"" character to it through there.
There's a turnout along the road near TR that has a creek running next to it with an old beaver dam through the middle. Really fun stop over the years. Back in 2007, the dam was active, and since then it has fallen to disrepair. It is fun to see how nature takes its course over the spanning years.
I hope you have a wonderful trip! We are having a reasonably nice summer up here so far!"
364	June 23, 2019 1:18PM	cdnpinhead	I did this trip 12 years ago, but had to do 600 - 800 mile days to make it fit into the two weeks I had available. My wife isn't interested in that kind of auto travel, so opted for a trip to Hawaii with her sister. I only just got into AK, then went up through Chicken to Dawson City & back down, Had planned to use the Cassiar hwy to go back down, but there was a major slide on it, so had to go down the way I came up, at least as far as the cutoff to Hudson's Hope, where I headed down to Prince George. This trip is set up for max 400 mile days, so we're both doing it this time.

369	June 23, 2019 10:18PM	qbrozen	"So I was asked what we found for the kids here in Spain.
We visited:
Gibraltar, which included the WWII caves and Ape's Den. They enjoyed this, although it was a brutal trip getting there, and it involved A LOT of walking. That place is NOT tourist friendly, which is bizarre since the activities are obviously geared toward tourism. Signage is non-existent, and parking is at a premium, with zero parking NEAR the tourist attractions.
Nerja Caves. Kids LOVED this. Instead of going with gen pop, for just a few bucks more, I opted for the guided tour with a small group that takes place after regular cave hours. We had an absolute top-notch host who was heavily involved in exploring the caves over the years. Including the 4 of us, our group was just 13 people, and the tour took nearly 2 hours.
Zoo de Castellar. Everyone thought this was the highlight of our trip. Kids got to play with a baby tiger and baby mountain lion, and hang out in the lemur habitat, goat pen, and bird sanctuary, petting and feeding them.
Today, our last day, we went into the center of Madrid and walked around the flea market they have there every Sunday. Seems to be a really nice city with (mostly) nice people. We head home tomorrow."

At 5,500 miles on the new Coopers, the rears are wearing measurably quicker than the fronts.

Same hospital, same ICU, and same health problem—sepsis. Shuffling back and forth between home and hospital. Crying and waiting for what seemed like the inevitable. On Saturday, there was a miracle. My father, a physician himself, was able to survive emergency surgery (actually on Wednesday), stop dialysis, get off the ventilator, and wake up for the first time since Wednesday. He has a long road, and is still pretty ill. But he's moving back from the cliff, and so am I.

I would assume the systems in your area are sized to maintain that much of a drop. I don't think the system in my house would maintain 73 when it's 105. At 97 or so it pretty much runs almost constantly to keep 73 in the heat of the day. It shuts off only for maybe 8-10 minutes every hour or less.

Been super hot down here, low to mid 90's. We keep our a/c at 79 when we're home as it's super cold at anything below that. There was an issue last week so they came out on Saturday to check everything out. Blowing cols air at 59 degrees which the tech said is perfect. We put in the unit in 7/18, so not even a year old. Think the wife just panicked last Friday when something blew the switch in the fuse box in the garage as it was not blowing cold air. Came home and hit the 2 a/c switches and we had cool air finally. Tech couldn't find anything wrong. Blowing very cool right now at 3:30 pm while it's showing 93 outside.
Very efficient unit also, as our power bills are less than the previous year. The old unit was unfixable last year so we had no choice but to replace it."
432	June 25, 2019 7:41PM	Sandman6472	"Incredible as it seems, still getting bills from my 2018 gall bladder situation. Like MB's dad, I ended up with sepsis and pneumonia and was very close to death according to all the doctors involved. Am paying off my share of the hospital but more bills came in the past two days and they want another couple thousand from me! Crazy!! Called my health plan earlier and of course, all the bills are wrong so she told me to do nothing and they will recalculate and get with the doctors involved. Seems like for both surgeries, they used an out of network anesthesia provider even though the hospital had all my insurance information and my wife asking them to use only in network doctors.
My insurance is going to try to get them to take the same fees as if they were in network. If so, I'd only be responsible for 15% instead of the 35% for out of network providers. My bills are around $160K all in right now so even my 15% is substantial. Can understand why folks go bankrupt with certain medical bills. Am very lucky to have decent insurance but never the less, healthcare in America is still out of whack and needs to be put under control! No one should have to lose so much when getting sick. If I were a deadbeat with nothing, it wouldn't cost me a cent. Don't get me wrong, don't mind paying a reasonable amount as my co-pay but it needs to be reasonably priced in the first place. Again, no one should be denied adequate healthcare and no one should go bankrupt after they do get it!!
Will get ff my soap box now."
433	June 25, 2019 7:46PM	Sandman6472	"The more I'm reading about the new Hyundai Venue, the more I'm liking it and think it'll be the best choice for my next vehicle. The ""Denim"" option looks to be the best one for me as I want all the safety nannies, the better audio system, a sun/moon roof and 17"" alloys. The length will be 159"" which is just perfect. A bit shorter than the Kona from what the article said. Similar to the Kia Soul which I also like but, no something I want. Also curious about the upcoming 2020 VW Golf but from the pic I saw, couldn't see a thing. VW now beats Hyundai/Kia in the warranty department, as I want a long one next time."

437	June 25, 2019 8:37PM	28firefighter	We tend to run our AC when temps are above 75 in our house - it gets stuffy, quickly after that. Combined with my kid's tendency to get Croup, cool air is the ticket.
438	June 25, 2019 8:45PM	Sandman6472	"Have decided to write to VW headquarters and see if they'd be willing to help me pay for this last repair I had with my drivers door lock. Makes no sense for what happened really and the repairs were a bit on the expensive side. Figure if I don't ask, I'll never know and hey, the worst they can say is ""no""!
This worked twice with Honda when there were a couple of issues that they eventually covered as a recall. Both times I wrote them a letter and both times they sent me a check for just over half of each issue. Should I have gotten a full refund, yes...but took what they offered because figured it was the best I could get. Sometimes things in life ain't always fair so I took the best I could and moved on.
Hopefully VW will see my point and help me pay for either all or part of the repairs. The worst they can say, again is ""no"" but ya don't get if ya don't ask! And I'm gonna ask!"
439	June 25, 2019 9:10PM	au1994	"@Sandman6472 - yes, the worst they can say is ‘no’ and after diesel-gate, maybe they’re in the customer service mood. At the least, maybe they’ll split the difference.

I should do this more. Reasonably ask for something from a service provider etc when service was subpar or an item failed earlier than normal."

451	June 26, 2019 2:45PM	nyccarguy	"That's interesting. Usually NY is grouped with NJ & CT as part of the ""tri state area.""

Similarly to the SET distribution is Subaru of New England which is a separate distributor from Subaru of America. Do they have separate mf & residuals?"

464	June 26, 2019 7:40PM	nyccarguy	"We had a decent amount of seat time in the Pilot yesterday (nothing like @cdnpinhead or @corvette). We dropped my 12 year old son off at camp in Byfield, MA. It was a 426 mile round trip. A beautiful, 3 1/2 hour drive up and a grueling 4 1/2 hour ride home with lots of rain.

My wife's parents bought some kayaks a few years ago. Due to some minor aging issues (and because they don't want to cheap sell them), they have offered the kayaks to us on numerous occasions along with the trailer. Truthfully we could use them. We go to the beach and can go out on Long Island Sound. My kids can kayak and eventually they won't like going to the beach just to build sand castles. Truth be told, I just don't want to deal with them/store them. Nor do I want to trek out to their place on Long Island (1 hr 15 min 1 way) to get these things and trailer them home with my Pilot.

We pull into a restaurant parking lot and back in right next to a TRD SPort Tacoma with 2 Kayaks sticking out of the back. I tell her that's the truck I was looking at. She looks and says, ""well you can fit the kayaks in without a trailer."" I replied: ""Yes you can!"" She then asked me at dinner ""if you really would want to drive a pickup truck instead of your Infiniti.""

""Well, no. I'd MUCH rather drive the Infiniti, but I'm going to fall out of love with it at some point. Why not get rid of it while I still have some fond memories. Plus at the price point per month compared to it's MSRP it will be hard to beat for 2 years.""

We shall see what happens"
465	June 26, 2019 7:54PM	suydam	As an Ohioan, Kentucky seems the south to me. For us more IN, OH and PA.
466	June 26, 2019 8:01PM	au1994	"Well, don’t look my way for any discouragement!

Went in to the office today but may try to go drive a Tacoma over lunch Thursday or Friday. My (very) flawed logic is rather than spend 1k on tires for a car neither of us really cares for, why not put the 1k down on the Tacoma and the last number I was quoted was 55/mo less than the X1. Outside of the gas mileage, the truck would be useful hauling stuff to the lake house which seems to be a never ending chore. Plus if the boat ever has to go in for service, I’ll have to pay the dealer to come get it or service it up there IE not at the dealer. Neither the X1 nor Crosstrek is towing a 21ft Sea Ray.

Lots of hurdles to cross though I’ll have to convince the wife though. She prefers that we be financing at least one vehicle instead of leasing both. Can’t say I blame her.

She would take the Subaru which she likes but not sure it would be her first choice if a new car is in the offing.

Plus I need to drive the Tacoma. I’ve had a Tacoma (95) and a Ram regular cab and a number of SUV’s but have not driven anything that big as a DD in close to 10 years. It may not be my cup of tea any longer."
467	June 26, 2019 8:10PM	stickguy	For such limited duty, seems like a good option would be a cheaper used one as a spare car. That’s the way I would want to do it.
468	June 26, 2019 8:18PM	kyfdx	"I think the whole point is that the three states intersect at some point. Also, that it generally is attached to a metropolitan area of some kind. At least, that is the case here in the Tri-State.

Pretty sure that OH, IN and PA don't intersect. OH, IN and MI intersect, but there is nothing there."
469	June 26, 2019 8:20PM	qbrozen	"well, NJ and CT don't intersect either, so I'm not sure what that's about.
I would think it should form a triangle, but what do I know?"
470	June 26, 2019 8:22PM	kyfdx	"That's true... I thought about that.

I'd guess there are a dozen locations in the US, at least, where the TV weatherperson says, ""It's going to be rainy today in the Tri-State area"". They definitely say that in Cincinnati.

I have some faint memory of the same thing in Huntington, WV, when I was young."
471	June 26, 2019 8:26PM	stickguy	"It’s based on metro area, usually a big city as the hub. So lower NY, N. Jersey and S Ct. for NYC trivstate.

Philly gets S jersey, eastern PA and northern Delaware."

479	June 26, 2019 10:13PM	qbrozen	So tri-half-states area?
480	June 26, 2019 10:18PM	Michaell	That's either 1.5 states or 1/6 of a state, depending on how you look at it.
481	June 26, 2019 10:18PM	kyfdx	One metro area that has suburbs in three states - pretty much the definition of a tri-state area.
482	June 26, 2019 10:19PM	pensfan83	"I've read the same. Although with msd's this is probably through Toyota Financial.

487	June 27, 2019 3:51AM	corvette	Nice! They way some of them are advertised, I thought they only applied if you lived in that region.
488	June 27, 2019 3:59AM	28firefighter	Sometimes he advertises leases through local credit unions - those do have residency restrictions. But most of the time it’s Ally or US Bank.
489	June 27, 2019 4:12AM	nyccarguy	I think the thing to do would be to lease a TRD Pro 4Runner that has (I think) the same residual (according to TFS) as the “regular” 4Runners with MSDs through a northeast broker that gives a healthy discount. Supposedly these go for StIcker Plus Out west. At pretty much any point in time you should be able to dump it for more than your payoff.
490	June 27, 2019 5:00AM	nyccarguy	"I saw that. Insane. At that price, I could ALMOST look into getting another car for the other 10K per year I drive. Or keep the Infiniti and add that to the fleet.

Property tax bills came in the mail today. Real Estate taxes up a little over 5% from last year. Crossed over the $10K per year threshold.

Personal Property Tax on the 3 cars is $1,098"

There's plenty of great CUV's out there. Glad Toyota has kept the same formula with the 4Runner."
496	June 27, 2019 12:40PM	stickguy	I’m in philly region. Dont need another car though. But if I was shopping now, I would not pass up that deal.

501	June 27, 2019 3:00PM	pensfan83	If Tacomas are still leasing like that in a year and there's no attractive lease options available at that point in time on sedans or sporty SUVs I would consider picking one up as a stop gap until something more attractive was available. Would need to be an auto though.
502	June 27, 2019 3:03PM	au1994	It would be a cool change of pace for you even if you only did a 24 mo lease. I’ve seen some strong numbers on that term, just not in my area. I’m in GA and the ad valorem tax doesn’t make for as favorable lease terms as other areas. They are there, you just have to work a little harder

505	June 27, 2019 3:47PM	pensfan83	For my daily commute of a few miles 3 days/week to the bus depot and other regular use it would be fine.

But, in the time period (‘77-‘83), it was a great car. My girlfriend bought a ‘79 in 1984, and I was in love. 😏

Since nobody asked, the E46 is the pinnacle for me. Just a beautiful, timeless design in any form. Still very much an analog drivers car. The E30 is pretty special too, it was a step up in refinement and with the lovely I6 is a blast to drive. The E36 is a nice enough successor but I have never warmed to the styling as much. E9x is pretty good to. Starting to get a little more away from the pure driver/analog experience but still good. And then there's the F30. Its a great drive train in search of a great chassis. Noticeable cheapening of the interior bits too in spots where BMW thought/hoped you wouldn't notice."

Oh my, what a difference...even with the stock stereo. Gave it a wash last night before storms rolled through and checked all the fluids, there's a very small leak developing around the distributor so I suspect the o-ring needs replaced.
We are currently childless (they are with my parents and their cousins in Ohio at Great Wolf Lodge) so we're going away to the Laurel Highlands for the weekend and taking the Prelude. Anxious to have some extended seat time on the highway."

523	June 28, 2019 3:59PM	tjc78	"Way back when, they gave a strong offer for my 09 Genesis. Autolenders ended up with the best # by almost $1,000 IIRC, otherwise it would have went to CarSense.

Good luck!"
524	June 28, 2019 4:38PM	nyccarguy	gOOD lUCK!
525	June 28, 2019 5:23PM	qbrozen	"Sold!

So we had been emailing back and forth this morn. Told him it is a drive so I'd like a ballpark. Of course, he said he couldn't, but he did ask what I was expecting. I was straightforward and explained Carvana offered $18.5k but gave me a hard time about the title situation. He said $18.5k sounds perfectly reasonable if the car is as described. And, if I could get there before noon today, they'd give me a ride home. OK, cool, I'm on my way.

It was pretty painless. BUT, the kicker, and something I dreaded hearing ... the car has had paintwork. UGH! I didn't inspect it myself and just went on the fact that my dad never mentioned anything. They said the roof, hood, and trunk were painted. No side panels, just the top of the car. But its not on carfax. So theory was hail damage at the dealership. HOWEVER, due to crazy low mileage and condition otherwise, they'd still give me $18k. GREAT! I thought that was more than generous given the finding. While waiting on paperwork, I texted my sister and she said he did have a situation where leaves had left permanent marks in the paint, so the dealership repainted it. Wow, OK, news to me. But I passed that info along to Carsense. Was back home about 2.5 hrs after I left this morn."
526	June 28, 2019 5:27PM	Michaell	Glad you were able to get a price you were comfortable with.
527	June 28, 2019 6:28PM	nyccarguy	"Awesome! You deserve SOMETHING easy during this whole process.

Don't forget to post back over on REAL WORLD TRADE IN VALUES. I'm sure the guy over there would appreciate your feedback!"
528	June 28, 2019 6:33PM	qbrozen	I don't recall asking myself the question on RWTIV. :b
529	June 28, 2019 9:20PM	marcogallo1986	@qb glad dads car is sold and all is whell!
530	June 28, 2019 10:23PM	28firefighter	In case anyone is wondering just how desperate Subaru dealers are - a local one just quoted me $9000 off MSRP on an Outback 3.6R Touring. It's for finance purchases and isn't compatible with 0%, but still...
531	June 28, 2019 10:45PM	corvette	Does $9k off make it about a $30k car? That’s pretty good.
532	June 28, 2019 11:11PM	28firefighter	$31k+ TTL
533	June 28, 2019 11:32PM	nyccarguy	You didn’t get a lease quote?
534	June 29, 2019 12:54AM	stickguy	good deal. if I was in the market, would interest me. at that price might be better than leasing. Since they still hold value really well.
535	June 29, 2019 1:03AM	28firefighter	Much higher on a lease by about $2k.
536	June 29, 2019 1:37AM	andres3	"No offense to the Outback, but the $40K sticker is outrageous, so $9K off doesn't entirely surprise me.

At $31K they make sense. Remember, the Alltrack outscored it on CR and if you don't need the extra 15% of size you can get an Alltrack out the door for that much."
537	June 29, 2019 1:43AM	28firefighter	Maybe in handling. But the 1.8T doesn’t even compare to the 3.6. At least not without a tune.
538	June 29, 2019 2:01AM	marcogallo1986	28 firefighter, that’s an awesome deal that are getting on our backs I would jump all over one if I had the need now.
539	June 29, 2019 2:02AM	marcogallo1986	Nice on everything else posted in here the past two days everybody. My favorite color of all time on our car any car looks good in it if you ask me is red. Blue’s second. Or maybe even orange.
540	June 29, 2019 2:04AM	marcogallo1986	I like the red 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe my mom had but she at least back then that’s the best car color she’s had today. Was far from blend but your other colors she’s had since. Oh growing up we had a dark blue Nissan quest 1994. That was nice too.
541	June 29, 2019 2:05AM	marcogallo1986	Happy Friday everyone, I hope that everyone had a good week. Have a good weekend. Going to be beautiful weather here in the north east,
542	June 29, 2019 2:06AM	marcogallo1986	Got out in the Thunderbird Wednesday from most three hours with my cousin, it’s him driving around and looking at cars just close we can. In my old neighborhood but are used to live, came across this nice bed 1994 Ford explore the owner happen to be there it was a four car garage and was nice, it’s a one family owner car, and only has 51,000 miles, it is kept in the garage in the winter and not driven fully loaded. Thought that was awesome because it’s a real reality these days.
543	June 29, 2019 2:07AM	marcogallo1986	Was thinking to go to the local Cruise night then, but I have said to my cousin, let’s just drive around it’s more fun, how many of the same stories can be here for the older people with their cars gets old ha ha, no offense to anyone in here. Can always go another time have a whole summer to end of September to go.
544	June 29, 2019 2:23AM	sda	So glad you’re out having fun out and about. Remind my feeble memory, what year Thunderbird do you have, color, general description. My dad is legally blind and only can see shadows. In the last 3 years he’s been suffering from Parkinson’s yet you won’t find anyone with a more positive attitude.
545	June 29, 2019 2:56AM	andres3	"True, I'll concede that, but the CVT doesn't compare to the DSG either, in my opinion, and objectively, for fuel economy. I can average as much as 27 MPG, even with the tune, and both are AWD.

The 1.8T without a tune sits solidly right between or the middle of the 2.5 and 3.6."
546	June 29, 2019 3:06AM	andres3	"How long has it been on their lot?  Maybe they paid more than they should have.

I think it's been on their lot a LONG TIME! I'm dumbfounded they haven't slashed the price again.

The 2 minor accident one in Richmond has had a birthday on that used car dealer's lot; not good!"
547	June 29, 2019 10:57AM	sda	If it can be confirmed the accidents were extremely minor, such as only a bumper cover replacement I would be very hesitant to buy. It will always be in your subconscious that the car was wrecked and possibly not right, and it becomes an issue again at resale.
548	June 29, 2019 1:09PM	qbrozen	"Well, let’s see...

A 2016 with 36k miles pulls $22k at auction. That’s 29% down from purchase price. $3k/yr. $250/mo. Tax/tags/fees... estimate $1500, or $500/yr. total $291.67/mo. Of course, that is before interest, which is about $50/mo on a good 60-mo term with $0 down. So ~$342/mo in the end. About 0.85% of MSRP per month. Pretty strong for a subaru, but can do a bit better on some German cars.

And, no, I have no idea why I just went through all of that. LOL"
549	June 29, 2019 1:12PM	stickguy	"so was it better to lease still?

one thing with this, if I was getting it now, it would be the wife's car, and something we want to keep long term (10 years probably). so the lease vs. buy equation is different. might still lease if it was an overwhelming deal, and figure out 3 years from now what to do (buy it, lease new, buy a replacement).

she does not like change much. Gets used to how everything works, and wants to stick with it. She still does not understand how to do half the stuff my car can do."
550	June 29, 2019 1:58PM	au1994	Stop. Just stop.
551	June 29, 2019 2:08PM	Michaell	"About every 2-3 weeks, my Subaru dealer sends me a post card telling me we can “upgrade” our Outback to a 2019 model and save a bunch of money each month. The offer is now down to $470/mo for a 3.6R limited.

The fine print shows the trade value, which is $1000 less than Carmax and $2000 or more less than Vrooms offer."
552	June 29, 2019 2:14PM	nyccarguy	Me too!
553	June 29, 2019 2:54PM	28firefighter	Interestingly the one dealer did tell me it is really pushing down trade values for late model outbacks. I haven’t seen that but interesting nonetheless.
554	June 29, 2019 3:47PM	marcogallo1986	@SDA it’s a 1961 Ford Thunderbird, yellow color with black interior. Eventually have to redo the dashboard and carpet, and headliner not in the best of shape, but someone redid the seats prior to me hey, I don’t want it perfect anyway perfectly fine. Have to do the weatherstripping all around eventually, just did the trunk so far. And eventually one day the paint all a work in progress little by little. That’s awesome you don’t legally blind to as well, and very positive, that’s the way to be enjoy every day to the fullest. He could see a little bit less than me I can see the sheep and color of things and every little detail, when it’s daytime nighttime outside, hair, skin color, clothes color, can read large print letters up close slowly, I know Grill too, I was taught both. But this is all lighting being really good with seeing the colors and shapes of things, if it’s dark outside like my time forget about it no way. Enjoy your Saturday, and also everyone else in here too As well, hot hot hot outside, but no complaints from me I’ll take it over the cold personally any day. Was gonna attempt to start painting the inside of the trunk of the Thunderbird of the port 15 can I tempt it on my own, but today is not the day has to be cooler out. And I have no trees around direct sunlight burn up. Got a find someone to go to the beach with, or maybe see if my aunt and uncle are around and go in they were swimming pool later on. Ha ha
555	June 29, 2019 9:43PM	benjaminh	Hey folks. With one year of my 3-year lease over, I'm still enjoying my 2018 TLX tech. The sound system is very good, the 4-wheel steering is fun, the Milano leather seats are comfortable, handling is good, and acceleration with the 2.4 is fine for me and gets in the mid to high 20s in the city and the mid to high 30s on the highway. I'm now at 13,500 miles, and so a bit above my 12k a year lease. Seems like the kind of car that with maintenance and some luck might last to 200k, and it's nice enough that I feel like might even enjoy driving it for that long. But we'll see. Anyway, I've been busy with work and other stuff the last few months, but I'd be interested in how other people are doing with their rides these days. Any new car purchases recently happen or about to happen?
556	June 29, 2019 10:42PM	28firefighter	Punch pending.
557	June 29, 2019 11:22PM	Michaell	Oh, wow.
558	June 29, 2019 11:25PM	tjc78	YES!!!!!
559	June 30, 2019 12:20AM	28firefighter	"2019 Subaru Outback 3.6 Limited in Wilderness Green.

$1k OOP (of which $600 was registration) and $298/month including 10.5% tax for 36 months and 10k a year. I didn’t expect to do a deal today but I could not walk away from that. It was my wife’s top color choice and inventory of the 3.6 is dwindling.

A new 2020 will be in the upper 3s or low 4s.

I’m very popular in my house right now.

Stelvio will likely go away as I have someone interested but will also shop the BMW."
560	June 30, 2019 12:34AM	Michaell	"Um, Forester?

Membership revoked for that error.

And, great color - same as the one in our garage.

Fully loaded, I presume?"
561	June 30, 2019 12:49AM	28firefighter	What error?
562	June 30, 2019 12:51AM	suydam	I love the Forester! I know I’m in the minority but always preferred it to the Outback. We had one for a couple of years in the early 2000s. Congratulations!
563	June 30, 2019 12:54AM	Michaell	Forester not available with the 3.6 engine - didn't you mean to say Outback?
564	June 30, 2019 12:57AM	28firefighter	It’s fixed. I was trying to be clever.
565	June 30, 2019 12:58AM	stickguy	"the old 4 hour window to fix your error and pretend it never happened!

if they had offers like that back in December we would have an outback in my driveway too. Same one I was looking at. Love that color too.

and speaking of TLX, I second that the 2.4 is plenty zippy enough, and I am getting MPG like that too. I have had runs breaking 36. Pretty impressive. and the stereo, handling, etc. are top notch. I doubt I buy it out, and might want to move to a CUV for myself, but I would have no problem owning this for an extended time. Plus, no turbo to worry about!"
566	June 30, 2019 1:13AM	pensfan83	@28firefighter nice! Congrats!
567	June 30, 2019 1:14AM	nyccarguy	@28firefighter - Mazel Tov & Congrats on the Outback!
568	June 30, 2019 2:00AM	Michaell	"Just giving you grief.

Congrats, and a great color choice. That was the only color my wife would live with. Had to wait two weeks for it to arrive from Indiana.

We love it."
569	June 30, 2019 2:03AM	Michaell	The lack of a turbo is something that appeals to me for long term ownership. But, I’ll admit I’ve been eyeing 228 coupes lately - quite a few of them with AWD for under $25k used.
570	June 30, 2019 2:32AM	fintail	Congrats @28firefighter , surprised there were any left at that price and how they sell around here.
571	June 30, 2019 3:13AM	stickguy	"I am not doing a low slung coupe. That I can guarantee.

Wife started commenting about how old the RDX is. got a big of a 'tude about my car having another 2+ years before it is done and (sticking to plan) she gets a new one and I get a hand me down. I mentioned the outback killer deals, and she answered about not know if she likes them. But she really does like the new RDX. So I have a strong suspicion that in a couple years, we will potentially be a 2 RDX family.

TLX just turned 6 months old last week, and I finally cracked 4,000 miles this week."
572	June 30, 2019 3:27AM	Michaell	You put on miles like I do. Jetta crossed the 16,000 mile threshold a couple weeks ago, and the lease is up in August.
573	June 30, 2019 3:46AM	28firefighter	"So the longer story was I had no intention of buying a car today. Truly. However, I started seeing on the Outback forums that dealers up this way were starting to really get pressure to unload the remaining inventory before the 2020 lands. Hence my post last night.

Started talking to my wife and she was on board with the idea of flipping the Stelvio (transfer it) and getting the outback, I’d drive the X1 until lease end and then see what happens. Even having her on board, I knew to make this happen would be a long shot.

I had emailed a dealer near Tacoma who gave me a screaming deal on a buy or lease. But they didn’t have the color my wife wanted (Green). Made some calls and a dealer I have a relationship with was on the verge of dealer trading his green one away when I called. I told him what I had from the other place and said I’d come over this afternoon to get it. And that was the show. Did credit online, drove over and was out in 90 minutes - wait for finance was long.

Wife got home after the 20 mile drive and said I’d need to pry it away from her. She’s said that exactly never before about any car.

The 3.6 engine is darn quick and very very smooth. Really impressed so far."
574	June 30, 2019 3:50AM	Michaell	"I think your wife will really like the Outback. Smooth and comfortable. Good road trip car, and blends in with the surrounding traffic, so you can exceed the speed limit and be inconspicuous about it. I've had ours up to 90 MPH on I-25 in Southern Colorado and New Mexico and the wife hardly notices.

Still looks good after 4+ years. A dent here, and a scrape there, which is to be expected. Cargo room, with the rear seats up or down, is more than adequate. Does yours have the rear seat rubber protectors on the back of them?"
575	June 30, 2019 3:51AM	28firefighter	It does. It seems to have come with every single accessory Subaru offered except a remote start.
576	June 30, 2019 3:53AM	Michaell	"I think ours was equipped the same way.

Yours, of course, has better headlights and CarPlay. I'll miss the latter when the Jetta goes back and I start driving the Outback more."
577	June 30, 2019 7:39AM	marcogallo1986	@ 20 firefighter very nice I didn’t see this coming you caught us all off guard, very excited your wife got a nice color choice not a bland white black silver or gray. Congratulations to your wife, and I see you have a punch soon from your above posting probably within the next couple of weeks, before the end of July. Very happy for you both, keep us updated on everything.
578	June 30, 2019 2:20PM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter glad she’s enjoying it so much already that’s awesome.
579	June 30, 2019 3:53PM	tifighter	@28firefighter congrats. Glad your wife likes it. Got to give the people what they want...
580	June 30, 2019 4:12PM	jmonroe1	"Good luck with the/her new Subie. I don't have that problem with Mrs. j. All she wants is a car she is used to. Getting a new car for her was like pulling teeth. I worked on her for at least 3 years to let me dump her 2012 Legacy Limited with the 3.6 and get an exact replacement. This past April it finally worked. In the end the way I did it was to pull up the Subie website and start changing colors. She was in the office chair watching TV. She glanced over at me on the computer and when she saw what I was doing she harshly reminded me that she didn't need another car. Needing and wanting are two entirely different things, as all of us know in here. Anyway, when she saw the Burgundy over Beige pop up she said, ""that IS a nice color. IF I wanted another car, that is the color I would want, outside and inside. Now I'm getting somewhere. I told her that her car was getting old, 7 years old to be exact, and even though the car just turned 36K miles, it wouldn't be trouble free forever. She said something like, ""even I know that 36 thousand miles is not a lot of miles for a car"". I didn't say a word, just kept zooming in on the interior and exterior pics. Finally she said, ""I don't want another car but how much does that one cost"". Now I'm REALLY getting somewhere. Long story short, I pretty much did to her what I did when I wanted to buy my '09 Genny that was Burgundy over Beige. Just kept looking at the zoomed in pics. Like I've said before about that purchase, 'by the time I was done with her, I had her believing that she's the one that wanted the car and I was just an innocent bystander'. And it worked this time too. Don't know why it took me so long to pull out that strategy again.

I've heard mention in here about getting ""punches"" for a purchase. How do I go about getting an official punch? While I might not be a chronic car buyer by the standards set in here, the way I worked her has to account for something.

Any help is appreciated.

583	June 30, 2019 5:00PM	andres3	"Yes, Subaru is popular throughout the west coast, I got sent home without Outback for an offer I know was in the reasonable range (but obviously low for my benefit range). I'd say I was offering just $500 below the ""Costco"" deal in San Diego at an Irvine Subaru dealership. Arguably, since I was using a $500 ""Ambassador"" voucher coupon, 1,000 below, but I'd argue that's the same across the board."
584	June 30, 2019 8:12PM	benjaminh	"Amazing that you can lease a $39k car for that.

Also amazing that while everyone else has abandoned station wagons, Subaru sales have been booming for more than ten years while selling maybe 90% station wagon-SUVs.

The Subaru Foresters that my parents used to own seemed a bit rough compared to the Hondas I owned at the time, but I imagine that today a top-of-the-line Outback with a big 6-cylinder engine is pretty close to being a luxury car."
585	June 30, 2019 8:27PM	marcogallo1986	@Jmonro. One punch added! To the list!
586	June 30, 2019 8:28PM	28firefighter	"I love it so far. I can see why the obsession exists.

Now to get the Stelvio flipped. Anyone interested in a $295/month payment including tax for 13 months and 15k miles?"
587	June 30, 2019 8:49PM	au1994	Congratulations @28firefighter! That was a deal too good to pass up!

589	June 30, 2019 10:22PM	kyfdx	"Is that the pre-tax payment?

Is it currently road worthy?"
590	June 30, 2019 10:44PM	laurasdada	"Congrats, FF! And, another Stelvio bites the dust...
I'm wondering if the Alfa dealer that disappeared in my hood last year may be returning in another guise? In a former dealership, that appears to be a staging area for Tesla, there are now several Alfas on the lot.

At the movies last night, a rather gorgeous red Jag F-Type in the lot. GF noticed it, said if I bought one, she'd be glad to drive it. Told her I might be able to swing a leftover '18, white/black/awd for $70k otd. She said that's way too much for a car, $ could be spent on much better things (read; certain type of ring...). She's just wonderful."
591	June 30, 2019 11:21PM	corvette	That sounds lovely, but I don’t want to get rid of either of mine. And three cars in my driveway would be a nightmare.
592	June 30, 2019 11:45PM	jmonroe1	"Nice to hear you still like it. I doubt you'll fall out of love with the 3.6 engine. Getting that engine was a MUST when I bought Mrs. j the 2012 Legacy. Even went to Columbus Ohio to get it. So there was no doubt I had to get it again. The only thing that made me even think about getting another Subie was that it had the CVT tranny but once I gave it a good test drive, I didn't have anymore concerns. Even Son #1 who is a lot more critical about this kind of stuff, liked it when he drove it home after the purchase. I'm pretty sure they have programmed in shift points. If you don't pay a lot of attention to how it accelerates, most people wouldn't even know it has a CVT.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's going to take a chisel to get that smile off you face.

jmonroe"
593	July 1, 2019 1:37AM	qbrozen	I must be the only one who is not a fan of the Subaru. Engine itself seems OK, but the trans sucks any real fun out of it for me. But I know it isn’t intended to be a sporty vehicle, so I’m not exactly its audience.
594	July 1, 2019 1:47AM	suydam	I know how you feel. Everyone I know who has an Outback loves it to death. It’s just too big for me. I did like the Legacy and the Forester in colder climates, but in California no reason to sacrifice the MPG.
595	July 1, 2019 2:45AM	28firefighter	"Regarding the Stelvio, it’s $266/month pretax. With 10.5% tax it goes to $295/month. It’s fully functional.

Re: the 3.6 in the outback. This isn’t intended to be our “fun” car - it’s the family hauler. That said, I think the CVT does an astonishingly good job of keeping the engine in the sweet spot of the power band. It’s not a sports car and doesn’t handle as such, but it’s shockingly quick."
596	July 1, 2019 2:51AM	Michaell	Agreed. I think the lack of heft as opposed to mainstream SUVs helps with acceleration
597	July 1, 2019 4:49AM	28firefighter	"This is also very true. But it still feels very substantial.

We took delivery with 5 miles and have about 60 on it now. I’m really pleased to report that it has no rattles, creaks, etc even with the cargo cover installed. Also, the infotainment (while basic) is very intuitive and carplay works seamlessly.

I really need to do some reading on eyesight to understand it."
598	July 1, 2019 11:26AM	kyfdx	Same

I know he’s looking at another Hyundai most likely again. To each his own what you like what you don’t like. But I always say in here many times. Lol
602	July 1, 2019 1:00PM	marcogallo1986	Some looking online there’s a nice 3.6 or limited and read over here at a local dealer. Sounds lovely would buy it maybe if I liked it if I was driving. Lol hey can dream right why not. One day

607	July 1, 2019 2:36PM	28firefighter	@Michaell - Do you have any recommendations for rear seat protectors for the Outback? With the ivory interior and one car seat in the back plus a dog periodically, I'm thinking we need a seat protector.
608	July 1, 2019 2:55PM	Michaell	I don't, sorry. Kids are all grown and our dogs use a kennel when we transport them.
609	July 1, 2019 3:28PM	corvette	I bought a generic rear seat protector off of Amazon for the Tahoe and it works fine, despite being slightly small for the Tahoe’s very large second row bench seat. Access to seatbelts and LATCH points may be an issue for you, though.
610	July 1, 2019 3:29PM	corvette	Did some detective work and was able to figure out that the owner of the nearby Kia store bought the former MINI dealership and opened a Mitsubishi store there.
611	July 1, 2019 4:17PM	au1994	"Our X6 had ivory seats and I was able to find a nice generic fit one from Target. It didn't stay on the seat all the time, just when we know we'd have a dirty, wet kid or dog back there so I didn't mind a loose fit.

I found one specific for the X6 and was blown away by the price. Something like 475 IIRC."
612	July 1, 2019 4:19PM	28firefighter	I'd like to find something that is more fitted (for safety) with the car seat. Sam is a bit of a tornado and so is the pooch (when she is in the car). I'll see what I can find - I can't imagine a fitted one would be more than 80-90.
613	July 1, 2019 4:32PM	au1994	I don't blame you there. Check the Subaru website, there's bound to be a form fitting one. If not I'm sure you've already discovered the Subaru and model specific forum.
614	July 1, 2019 4:35PM	suydam	They can be expensive, but the cheaper ones don’t have slits for the belts and latch points, or if they do they’re in the wrong place to be any use.
615	July 1, 2019 4:47PM	cdnpinhead	"""I really need to do some reading on eyesight to understand it.""

Generally it's okay, and the adaptive cruise control is nice, but can get intrusive sometimes. One thing to keep in mind is that getting a new windshield is a very high-dollar exercise, given the $300-400 ""recalibration"" ceremony that needs to be done, in addition to the cost of the windshield itself. In our case, the person who replaced the windshield the first time put in one for a car without eyesight, so we're now on our third windshield."
616	July 1, 2019 5:18PM	laurasdada	Perhaps the WeatherTech folks do seat covers?
617	July 1, 2019 5:29PM	stickguy	Yes, but expensive. I have a good one from Duluth trading. Well made, reasonably price. It can be used as a hammock (for dogs), or seat cover. Openings for belts, and reversible.

I'll never understand the physics of the whole movement where it is unacceptable to have a cover between the car seat and the vehicle seat.

If the seat is mounted to the latch points, level and tight why would the protector lessen the safety?

I always wanted to put one since the car seats leave serious dents in the leather, but my wife read a few articles and was nervous.

I now just rotate my daughter's seat around the car to avoid long lasting dents. She we be in a booster soon enough and we are done with the large seats.

When I turned the 2012 LaCrosse I was worried about the seat. There were large dents from the car seat, but I was able to get most of it out."

623	July 1, 2019 5:51PM	pensfan83	I ordered a seat cover from Chewy.com when we got the dog 2.5 years ago. It's universal, but sturdy and it clips in to both cars very well and allows for me to tether Teddy in to the seat. I think I paid $60-$70 for it.
624	July 1, 2019 6:01PM	Michaell	Totally forgot about Duluth Trading - I'm a big fan of their stuff.
625	July 1, 2019 6:08PM	28firefighter	I've seen the same, @tjc78 but my feeling is if it is securely installed and ratcheted down, it should be OK.
626	July 1, 2019 6:21PM	xwesx	It only becomes an issue again at resale if you paid too much to start. Otherwise, it just continues to take that knock, and the effect is smaller and smaller as it continues to depreciate.
627	July 1, 2019 6:24PM	xwesx	Wow; impressive! Congrats.
628	July 1, 2019 6:26PM	xwesx	If you haven't done it already, don't forget the obligatory introductory photos.
629	July 1, 2019 6:31PM	xwesx	No, I'm right there with you. It has nothing to do with the transmission alone, but more the heavy burden of nannies tacked on with it. I strongly suspect that our 2013 Forester is likely the newest Subaru we will own. *Maybe* consider an MT version of some other model, but likely never a newer Forester or Outback, and we own/owned three of each of them.
630	July 1, 2019 6:47PM	Michaell	It looks like this, except the wheels are slightly different:

632	July 1, 2019 7:59PM	28firefighter	It is a great deal for an Outback, but really the more important thing is my wife is happy - and keeping her happy is important given how frequently I swap cars...
633	July 1, 2019 8:12PM	stickguy	I was surprised how much I liked the OB when I test drove it. the 3.6 made all the difference. Should have gotten the wife to look at it again. she is really not enthused though. Pretty much has her mind set on a new RDX. But, that has to wait a couple years yet!

639	July 1, 2019 9:57PM	marcogallo1986	Is anyone else punching the CCBA card this week, or before the end of July? I guess it’s a good thing I don’t drive, cause I would be doing that quite often I get myself into financial trouble big time. Back into thousand 14 I went at least a dog with my sister, was gonna try to give it to my dad just cause I wanted to do it. Or year and a half L out of that one just cause the thrill of doing it and of course was a financial mess. Then have a 15 Central for maybe two years out of that lease early, and that’s where we are now with my sister having the jeep. No moving for a number of years ha ha Ha. But if I could I would never get rid of that and get something else again. Sorry this posting is a bit messed up above 22 you’ll know why. Would never do that to a dog ha ha Ha. Just made me laugh.

They'll just turn it around and sell it for $20K.

Is checking with Carvana even worth it if I know Carmax hit the nail on the head."
642	July 1, 2019 10:53PM	marcogallo1986	@ondrays3 nice! What will the new posabal ride be?

644	July 1, 2019 11:21PM	corvette	Yes! They gave me close to retail for the Mustang I sold to them.
645	July 1, 2019 11:34PM	Michaell	"My quote with Carvana on the Outback was almost $2K higher than CarMax. Vroom was higher than both.

EDIT - I was thinking about why that is. Brick and mortar costs a lot to maintain, and when I was there (weeknight early evening), there were probably 15-20 staff milling about in the showroom."

649	July 2, 2019 1:24AM	pensfan83	"Our weekend getaway could be considered a success, we came back $250 richer thanks to the onsite casino at Nemacolin We also toured Kentuck Knob which I would highly recommend if anyone ever finds themselves in Western PA...even if you aren't familiar with Frank Lloyd Wright. We spent Sunday at Yough Lake with some friends boating and relaxing, beautiful weather all around.

Since this is CCBA the Prelude averaged 30 MPG for the weekend. The short gearing means that thing is screaming 75 MPH and with an aftermarket exhaust it got a little loud. Overall it's not a bad cruiser though swallowing us, our luggage, and a set of golf clubs. It was perfect for the weekend since it was just the 2 of us."
650	July 2, 2019 1:41AM	nyccarguy	Glad you got to enjoy your Prelude. Just remember, 3rd gear tops out at 80 mph. Before we had children, my wife and I took my Prelude everywhere. Skiing, Biking, a week’s vacation to Cape Cod, a few runs to Pittsburgh, her cousin’s wedding in Baltimore. It’s a great car for 2 people. My best friend and I even took it to Hilton Head, SC once.
651	July 2, 2019 6:48AM	xwesx	"That's fantastic!

Ohiopyle is a beautiful little town, too. We stayed five days at the campground that is just across the intersection from Kentuck Knob (well, the drive for it... the structure itself is a little further over the crest of the hill). Wonderful experience at the campground and hiking the hills around the ""Yough."" We were supposed to raft the river, but the trip was cancelled on us, so we just tooled around, enjoyed the peace and quiet, and the excellent... CHEAP... food!

Falling Water is just down the road (about 4-5 miles, IIRC) from Kentuck Knob. Have you been there, or just not on the agenda for this quick weekender?"
652	July 2, 2019 6:49AM	xwesx	A friend of mine had an '88 Prelude. He put over 400,000 miles on it!
653	July 2, 2019 12:20PM	graphicguy	Nice punch on a nice car @28firefighter.....big congrats!
654	July 2, 2019 12:21PM	pensfan83	"We have done Fallingwater on a past trip, that too is worth a stop if you're in the area. When the kids are older we'll probably do one of the whitewater excursions.

We absolutely love it up there....the lake, river, trails, etc. And yes, the food is plentiful, good, and as you noted cheap. There was a place that made fantastic homemade pies not far from Ohiopyle. Unfortunately it closed a few years ago, supposedly the kids of the owners didn't want any parts of running the restaurant. It's a shame because their lemon meringue was delicious. The entire area is close enough to be convenient but far enough to make you feel like the city is hundreds of miles away."
655	July 2, 2019 12:38PM	corvette	@pensfan83 I loved Kentuck Knob. Fallingwater is the showpiece, and isn’t far away. Way more crowded, though.
656	July 2, 2019 12:56PM	marcogallo1986	@ pants man 83, glad you and the wife had a nice little getaway this past weekend, and enjoying the prelude. I’ve never been to those parts of the US a just yet. But it sounds lovely, one day I’m going to go just to experience it.
657	July 2, 2019 1:00PM	marcogallo1986	@ Andres 3, yes we get a quote from her van up to, even room if you have it you are you can’t hurt. Even though Carmax give you an awesome offer.
658	July 2, 2019 4:42PM	xwesx	"Very true! We came from the north side when we stopped in there, and it seemed fairly rural (for that part of the country, anyway) for a good many miles. However, we left from the south end and headed to Baltimore to catch our flight home, and I was shocked at how quickly that rural feel vanished.

It is probably one of the few towns in America that doesn't even have a fueling station."
659	July 2, 2019 5:39PM	28firefighter	"Someone submitted an app on the Stelvio, so we'll see how that goes. I'll take over driving the BMW for 5 more months. Then we need to figure out what comes next.

For the life of me, I have no idea what I want - except another GTI of course, which is not a viable option at this point for size reasons."
660	July 2, 2019 5:51PM	pensfan83	With family hauling duties taken over by the Outback, what about a GLI?
661	July 2, 2019 5:53PM	28firefighter	It is high on the list. My one serious concern about it is that, wait for it, it has no rear air conditioning vents. I have no idea what clown came up with that cost cutting measure but the importance of cool air flowing to the back of a car with kids is crucial in avoiding motion sickness...
662	July 2, 2019 5:55PM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter good luck I hope it goes through readable to swap the lease to new person with no issues. What site are you using? You have five months to decide what you want, man eventually you’ll be able to get another GTI again when the kids are a bit older I guess. Anyone in here have any suggestions on what he should get, I’m guessing best to be an SUV?
663	July 2, 2019 6:08PM	pensfan83	"Let me also add that as your son gets older having more than one USB port is a must if he has any electronic devices. If there's one gripe about the Acura it's that it only has one USB port in the front console. We're pretty regimented when it comes to ""technology"" as its known in our house but over a 4-5 hour drive things eventually die. Which means when devices need charged I need to unplug from Waze for example.

And that is a bizarre omission, I thought that was pretty much standard fare now."
664	July 2, 2019 6:10PM	laurasdada	"Much against my better judgement, I'll be on the Cape this 4th weekend, with the GF and her family. Visiting such natural wonders as ice cream stands and mini-golf courses. Perhaps a trip to Martha's Vineyard on her uncle's boat for lunch (actually, I hope we do that, he does it somewhat regularly).

Likely, she'll be driving us down in the CX-5, easier for her mother to ingress/egress than my car.

The urge to new car grows stronger, perhaps I don't trust entering year 7 in the XF. Although, it's given me no signs of impending doom... In the realm of reality replacements, looking to go smaller, on my radar:

'20 Jag XE (I've read good reviews of the updates. And, well, Jag)
Volvo S60
Porsche Macan, likely used. Really, the only SUV/CUV whatever that interests me, not even the Jag SUV's pique my interest.
BMW M235/M240
MB C43
Audi A5 Coupe or SportBack.

But, it's so nice not having car payments and minimal property taxes on the 5.5 yo XF.

665	July 2, 2019 6:21PM	corvette	I’d invest in a 12v USB charger that plugs into the lighter socket (and a splitter for the socket if it’s otherwise occupied). I have chargers like that in both cars.

But plenty of leftover 2019 if anyone’s interested in a large SUV like that. I get my dad to start looking soon but he would need anything big like the two I mentioned. Need something mid size or smaller depending what he likes.
677	July 2, 2019 8:58PM	marcogallo1986	Something tells me my dad will go with another Hyundai, he was already talking about a Santa Fe or Tucson.
678	July 2, 2019 8:58PM	marcogallo1986	So I will see if my contact at the local Hyundai dealer and even 2 miles away if she still works there from a couple of years ago.
679	July 2, 2019 9:01PM	stickguy	I just now got an email from dealer that palisades arrived. Looks nice, good revues, but way too big for us.

If we were looking now, I would also show her the V60 and XC60 Volvos, BMW X3, and Subaru OB (new one). along with the Passport and RDX. Might throw in a Santa Fe just for kicks.
684	July 2, 2019 11:16PM	28firefighter	First day of rain here in Seattle. The outback definitely isn't new anymore now, though somehow I feel as though it will feel more at home in the rain and looking a little dirty than it will in shiny new condition.
685	July 2, 2019 11:24PM	stickguy	I had to chase after VW. they finally sent something maybe a month before. All the info was online though. Need to call to schedule someone to come out and inspect it at your house. Then just drop it at a dealer and go.
686	July 2, 2019 11:31PM	tjc78	Palisade will be on the list to replace the Enclave next year. I’m on the other side I wish it was the same size as the Enclave. I’m not sure what the numbers say, but it certainly seemed a little smaller (especially behind the third row) when I looked at it during the Philly car show.
687	July 2, 2019 11:31PM	tjc78	Hyundai hasn’t said a peep and mine goes back 11/7.
688	July 3, 2019 12:10AM	corvette	The CR-V is closer in size to the Q5, IMO. Can’t really comment on reliability, as my parents’ ‘18 only has about 10,000 miles.
689	July 3, 2019 12:35AM	sda	Though we’ve had a CR-V in the past, a good vehicle that only required regular maintenance, my wife isn’t interested in another one. I won’t rule it out.
690	July 3, 2019 1:35AM	Michaell	Thanks for the update. I make my last payment on the 17th, so if I haven't heard anything by then, I'll chase after them.
691	July 3, 2019 1:41AM	stickguy	you can go to VW credit website and log into your account. there is a tab for lease ending. I think you can request the inspection right from there. Or it has the number to call. you really don't need VW at all. Once the inspector comes out, he submits the eval to VWC and all you need to do is show up at a dealer and hand it over.
692	July 3, 2019 3:32AM	Michaell	"Done!

Inspection set for 7/18, one month and one day before the return date."
693	July 3, 2019 3:35AM	stickguy	if you wanted a replacement they would take care of it all together. but even if you just hand it back, they bill you later and you have some time (60 days I think) to get a new VW and they cancel the disposition fee. That is what we did.
694	July 3, 2019 3:57AM	Michaell	"I read through the end of lease process. I may have to attend to the dent on the front passenger door, depending on the size, and I know there will be a disposition fee, which I'll get billed for.

Still no plans to replace it, at this point. I drive it maybe once or twice a week at this point."
695	July 3, 2019 12:03PM	tjc78	"I still have to get my wife's Uh Oh taken care of the passenger door of the Enclave. That's going to ding me $1,000 for sure. Ugh

Elantra should be good to go as usual. No dents or curb rash on the wheels. Interior is perfect except for two 1"" light scratches on a door panel from me carrying a metal fixture that slid and hit the panel."
696	July 3, 2019 12:19PM	stickguy	Michael, let them look first. they waive up to a certain size, and somewhat depends on the inspector's mood. if they are going to hit you for it you know up front, and have the option to just eat it or get it fixed yourself (though I believe that requires having someone come back out?) The couple of small items on my 2 leases I was worried about got noted in the inspection, but were both N/C.
697	July 3, 2019 12:26PM	tjc78	"I really think the overall condition of the car plays into it.

I'm sure when they inspect the car if it's clearly been through hell you'll get charged for something that is a little beyond the specs. OTOH if the car is otherwise perfect and cared for I can see the inspector letting the one thing go.

For example... I'm sure a smokers car that was never cleaned in three years would cost the same to make right than one ding that PDR could fix."
698	July 3, 2019 12:58PM	stickguy	Hyundai sent a kit in the mail that included a measuring tool. if you could hide a ding or scratch under it, it was free.
699	July 3, 2019 1:00PM	tjc78	Good to know. Where do you return the car, dealer?

701	July 3, 2019 1:10PM	stickguy	yup. once the inspection is done (at your house, or work, whereever) it is in the computer, and you just show up at a dealer and they finish up. Takes about 15 minutes for them to do a quick visual (comparing to the inspection report I assume) and check the miles, have you sign a turn in form, and you are good to go.

I had someone ask if I was having hard times... they thought it was being repossessed. I asked why they would think that and the response was it happened to them."

TLX would be in the running too, a lot of car for the money."
710	July 3, 2019 5:37PM	28firefighter	I'm putting the TLX on my list for the fall/early winter as well. I'm worried it won't be quick enough for me, but I love the look of the A-Spec and I don't see many of them around here.
711	July 3, 2019 5:39PM	Michaell	I, too, like the TLX. I've test driven both the 2.4 and 3.5 - either would be fine, if equipped correctly.
712	July 3, 2019 5:47PM	stickguy	I find the 2.4 pretty zippy. But you can get same models with the V6. That is definitely fast.

There were 5 of us in the car when I tested the V6, and it still had more than enough power for me."
714	July 3, 2019 6:55PM	pensfan83	That's a lot of car for the money. At $57K it has to have almost every option.

716	July 3, 2019 7:05PM	qbrozen	yeah, its pretty good. I calculated it to about 0.75% of MSRP per month. My bimmer is at 0.725. If the volvo was something crazy like 0.66, I might make the change and risk sleeping on the couch. But, then again, its a 3-yr lease, and Volvo does not allow transfers.

720	July 3, 2019 8:18PM	stickguy	a 3 year lease does not bother me at all.
721	July 3, 2019 8:53PM	pensfan83	One benefit to a 2 year lease is the need to replace tires is diminished significantly if not altogether.
722	July 3, 2019 8:56PM	stickguy	offset by paying fees more often. Plus I tend to put lower miles on, so have a good shot not having to do that anyway.
723	July 3, 2019 8:58PM	nyccarguy	YES. Especially if you drive 20K per year. The prospect of a 2 year lease is very attractive.
724	July 3, 2019 8:59PM	stickguy	maybe, but I assume at those miles terms will stink. I do (so far) less than 10K a year, so don't have the same issues!
725	July 3, 2019 9:11PM	marcogallo1986	When my mom turned in her Hyundai SUV Specking 2003, they came to do the inspection at the house also, and a truck came to get it later the same day. It was through Hans financial I believe two as well.
726	July 3, 2019 9:12PM	marcogallo1986	That was the best color car she had to this day and my favorite, was a nice bright red.
727	July 3, 2019 9:14PM	marcogallo1986	@ stick guy, yes would be too big for my dad needs to, but seems nice from what I read. I also did like the Telluride it’s sister car just looks so different. From what the policy looks like, nice interior quality set in that one at the New York auto show the Telluride.
728	July 3, 2019 9:22PM	28firefighter	"So here is my initial list of cars to consider:
Acura TLX V6 A-Spec (New Lease)
BMW 4 series GC (preferably 440 lease or CPO 435)
Audi A4 (new lease or CPO 2017)
VW Jetta GLI (New)
Subaru Legacy XT
Honda Accord Sport 2.0T

None of them really gets me excited though - the 440 definitely would be fun to drive and I love the look/style of the GLI, but the interior may really bother me. The S60 isn't on the list because the styling just doesn't do it for me."
729	July 3, 2019 9:22PM	qbrozen	But if you do a sign & drive every time, the fees really mean nothing. I wouldn't do 24-mo if it wasn't favorable. Seems to be the way to go with big discounts, though.
730	July 3, 2019 10:27PM	andres3	Not a done deal by any means, but I have first right of refusal to a 2015 Audi S4 in Misano Red with DSG with under 30K miles on the clock. I was eyeing luxury beige interior '15 A4's, but the red 333+ HP S4 just speaks to me in ways where I can forgive an all black interior.

Fan motor on the 29 year old, extremely rusted outside unit gave up the ghost yesterday afternoon. $775 for a new fan motor or $4,175 for a new unit and new A-coil inside. Since I'm using the same company that installed my ductless mini split unit upstairs, they gave me a ""frequent flier"" discount. Also, I'm very grateful that I did not sell the window A/C unit that I used to use upstairs before I got the mini-split. I pulled it out of attic storage and put it in my bedroom window. Between running that in my downstairs bedroom and leaving the upstairs door open to allow the upstairs mini split to cool the entire house as much as it can, the house is relatively comfortable in spite of the main A/C being out of commission. I have the central HVAC blower running to circulate air, and the entire first floor has managed to stay in the low 70s today. It's a small house, but I'm still impressed.

I had a surplus I was planning on using to pay down the G37 loan, but looks like this will put me at least a couple of months out on making any extra payment on the G."

Amazing that you can lease a $39k car for that.

Also amazing that while everyone else has abandoned station wagons, Subaru sales have been booming for more than ten years while selling maybe 90% station wagon-SUVs.

The Subaru Foresters that my parents used to own seemed a bit rough compared to the Hondas I owned at the time, but I imagine that today a top-of-the-line Outback with a big 6-cylinder engine is pretty close to being a luxury car.
The big uptick in Subie sales came when the 2010 Outback debuted as the most SUV-looking wagon that ever was."
739	July 5, 2019 2:25AM	stickguy	"I think the wife is not happy I got the TLX last winter. She likes it, but yesterday made a random comment when we got into the RDX that ""it smells old"". Could be a long 2 years until it is time for a new one, that is definitely going to be for her."
740	July 5, 2019 3:05AM	fintail	"Now at about 3 months and a week with the wagon. Payment still makes me cringe a little, but it sure is nice to drive, really an ideal car. The most recent C&D has a blurb about their long term test example, nothing but positives.

Had a fun chat about it today when browsing a special interest used car lot - an employee and his father (apparently) were chatting, and noticed I drove the wagon. The father was really taken by it - car people ""get it"" (he had a same color W212 parked near me)."
741	July 5, 2019 3:18AM	Michaell	Can you infuse some new car scent into the RDX? Perhaps some leather treatment?
742	July 5, 2019 3:31AM	jmonroe1	"I know what that feels like. My condenser fan motor stopped working 2 years ago but my Lenox unit was only 9 years old when it happened. Nowhere near your 29 year old unit. However, it only cost me around $160 for a new fan motor via the internet. I was surprised it was delivered in 2 days even though I did not pay extra for shipping. I guess you can say I lucked out on that but I think the AC gods owed me that for the original early motor failure. Changing that motor was very easy. I think it took me about an hour to do it after I thought about how to go about doing it. I sure as hell wouldn't want that to happen with the heat and humidity we have had the last couple of days here in the Burgh. I don't think Ohio has been any better the last few days either. I admit that I'm a wimp when it comes to the heat of summers. To be honest, I don't know how I lived without AC when I was growing up.

She uses mine sometimes but prefers hers, since she knows how everything works, and it sits higher. So a new CUV when the time comes, with some good lessons on how the tech works.

I checked today. currently at 54,550 miles on it. I think it might last a while longer."
754	July 5, 2019 7:50PM	corvette	"I briefly thought about going the DIY route and looking for the part online, but for a nearly 30 year old unit, something else is bound to go soon anyway. It's also an eyesore, and then I'd have to be outside in the heat working on it.

Since I'm trying to get my house to the point that it's as low-maintenance as the one I had before, it made sense to replace it. Once I replace the deck with Trex and install gutter guards, exterior maintenance should consist of pressure washing, occasionally painting the front porch, and having the driveway sealed every couple of years."
755	July 5, 2019 8:39PM	ab348	"I've lived in this place for almost 22 years. One of the reasons I bought it was that it had a detached garage. It was only a small single-car, 12'x20', but seemed well built and did the job.

The problem was that it was probably as old as the house (built mid-'50s) and was sheathed only with ""ranch board"" plywood (I think it's also called T1-11). It had been painted a couple of times during my ownership but was really at the end of its life and was looking shabby. I also had accumulated a bunch of home and garden stuff that really was too much to handle inside the garage along with the Cutlass. So I am right now in the middle of having what amounts to an 8""x12"" garden shed extension added to it, along with new roof shingles and new vinyl siding in a color that matches the house. It should be very useful once it's finished and will allow the car space to be used just for car stuff.

As is always the case, now that the garage is looking good, the actual driveway is now looking not so hot. I don't know how old the asphalt is but it has wheel depressions in it and is also probably due for replacement. I will have to add that to my list of improvements."
756	July 5, 2019 9:25PM	sda	"Home ownership can be a real drain on the check book, yet I prefer it to renting. At least there is the potential for appreciation and we can make modifications to it as we like.

Does your ATS have to stay outside, or is there a garage attached to your house?"
757	July 5, 2019 9:58PM	ab348	"No, it lives in the driveway. From time to time I think of having a carport of some sort built, but the snow and wind here might make that problematic. The other thought I have at times of weakness is to excavate a second driveway that would allow it to be parked underneath a new non-permeable deck, but it might be cheaper just to relocate.

Really, the list of projects is never ending - a new kitchen is likely next, then perhaps new siding on the house to replace the dated aluminum, the list goes on. Like you, having lived in rental apartments from 1982 until 1997, I would be reluctant to go back to that. I like the quiet and privacy here, and enjoy the yard and garden even if it is a lot of work at times."

760	July 6, 2019 11:59AM	carnaught	"Greetings from Barcelona. Prior, spent time in Italy, Cannes, Nice and Monte Carlo (to keep it car related.)

Main reason for the post is a new punch to report. It’s a 2019 Avalon Hybrid Limited. It’s loaded with heads-up display, nav., 360 degree camera, crash mitigation and most of the other safety nannies. My work has me traveling over a considerable amount of city travel, and I wanted all the toys and great efficiency and gas mileage. Why, you ask, with it’s uh, “prominent” grill and CVT? Because I can, and surprisingly, the grill doesn’t bother me. The Prius is staying in the driveway till the GLC is sold, now resting in my son’s garage next to his ‘18 A4, till the wife and I are back from Europe.

The Avalon is wind chill pearl white with Cognac leather. I’ve had it for over three weeks with city mileage in excess of 46 mpg with RUG. It’s very comfortable and quiet, and surprisingly not boring, very good ergonomics, great JBL audio and 12 way seats, which to me are more comfortable and supportive than my GLC. I like the lack of delay, compared to the Benz, in switching audio stations or to and from Bluetooth, among some other things. The CVT seems, like what many have observed with the Outback, to be very non-CVT like, and the fake sound makes it sound good. I’m not saying it’s better than the GLC, just different.

Well, I know, it’s not many/most of your’s cup of tea, but....different strokes... Also, it doesn’t hurt that I got over $7k off MSRP, with ceramic window tint and all weather and carpeted mats thrown in, probably because of slow sales. Toyota care service is included, with free service for 24 mos.

That’s it for now...the naysaying may now commence. Cheers !"

775	July 6, 2019 5:37PM	sda	With the wife and daughter visiting relatives in Ga, I took the opportunity to do some car lot canvassing. The larger CarMax in town must have a dozen 2016 Audi Q5s and also Q3s. I guess they got a deal, I assume lease returns. Anyhow, my wife keeps mentioning she likes the Q5, so I thought I'd take a peek. The Premium Plus would be a nice one to get. I think everyone had a black interior, hot. They were 2016s with 25-45k on them priced from the low to mid 20s. I then stopped at the Audi dealership, about 2 miles from CarMax. They had a full showroom of people looking and all but me seemed to have a sales person talking to them. So I peeked in several cars, went outside to look at several CPOs, then came back inside hoping someone would approach me so I could ask questions about pricing, etc. I guess I'm invisible, no one even said hello. No matter, I wasn't buying anyway, just a little surprised no effort was made to greet me. I do think we would both enjoy the Q5.
776	July 6, 2019 5:43PM	28firefighter	"The Q5 is very nice. My MIL has a 2012 Q5 2.0T Prestige with 60k miles that they bought new. Even today, it doesn’t feel dated. Engine is very peppy and moves it along nicely.

Aside from a couple small things under warranty and a failed turbo that Audi repaired under goodwill, it has been very reliable. Just routine oil changes and brakes."

Speaking of 2-series (a few posts back), I had the daughter's MINI in for service (oil, filter, plugs and cabin air filter), so I took the opportunity to go check out a Valencia Orange 228xi that the local Acura dealer has had on their lot for some time. @breld has been tracking it - started out priced at $25K, now down to $23.2K. 21,000 miles on it, and decently equipped, but no Sport package. No matter.

I enjoyed driving it. Was just the right size - not too big, not too small. Punchy engine, and, playing around with the settings, it can be either comfortable or sporty, as you desire. Nice interior - black, which isn't my first choice - and everything makes sense.

Would be nice to have, but just not in the market at the moment. I'm sure I could find one in grey/silver/white/black in a heartbeat if I got serious."

787	July 7, 2019 3:04AM	marcogallo1986	He says next year hopefully his car will last till then then he’ll look, I’m trying to get him to do something a lot sooner, because that’s what we do in here, and I know I have the support encouragement from everyone else in here too as well. What the heck can’t hurt to look on cars.com or wherever else any other sites, for all you stop why not. Even looking at grand Cherokees for him since you like stores. And key is to your name I’m looking. Could we play spent most of today and probably will spend later on tonight open till knows what time tomorrow morning looking, during the week to why not.
788	July 7, 2019 3:04AM	marcogallo1986	And got a text from my sister-in-law asking about some cars, I think she might want to trade in her 2016 Pathfinder and get something a little newer. That’s what she does keep the car for two and even three years and get another one. She likes buying used to it helps tremendously.
789	July 7, 2019 3:07AM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter, how about a nice used five series for you, or maybe even a three series, or is that too small? Which Mercedes was it or you bought used or at least or whatever the deal was last year that you didn’t like, I can’t remember.
790	July 7, 2019 3:12AM	nyccarguy	@fezo ! Hey! Welcome back (even though we know you never left)! Congrats on all the goodness in your world! Way to go on 2 punches!
791	July 7, 2019 3:12AM	nyccarguy	@carnaught - congrats on the Avalon Hybrid!
792	July 7, 2019 3:53AM	stickguy	looks like a nice one. they tend to fit better if you don't get the hammock style (though those cover more of the floor if you want them to.
793	July 7, 2019 3:55AM	28firefighter	It came with the heavy duty all weather mats from Subaru, so the floor is well protected.

795	July 7, 2019 2:18PM	roadburner	I saw a Sunset Orange M2C this weekend. Three pedals and no hole in the roof. Also saw a 2009 Silverstone M3; the V8 is tempting.

797	July 7, 2019 4:48PM	28firefighter	Braintrust - thinking about getting my dad one of those high speed exotic car driving experiences. Do any of you have any experience in the northeast or with providers that you’d recommend?
798	July 7, 2019 7:30PM	Michaell	I've used Xtreme Xperience for my drives here in CO. They travel to tracks around the country, and I have enjoyed every one.
799	July 8, 2019 12:00AM	qbrozen	Wife got me into a Ferrari one once. It was a small course set up in a parking lot (Meadowlands) with cones. I believe it was like $99 for 5 laps. Car was well beat up. It was fun but not worth it, IMHO. Wish I could remember the host company.
800	July 8, 2019 12:00AM	nyccarguy	Plus 1 - I’ve done XTreme Xoerience as well. Very well run & the cars are awesome! I did it in Englishtown, NJ
801	July 8, 2019 12:01AM	28firefighter	Thanks guys!
802	July 8, 2019 12:02AM	nyccarguy	That was the one I recently did. The wife and kids bought it for me for my birthday. Not as much fun as the real track!
803	July 8, 2019 2:18AM	corvette	"I guess there's a butt for every seat, but what exactly does the company do with a ""beat up"" Ferrari once they're done with it? Send it to auction? Or send it to the dealer for tens of thousands of dollars of recon first?"
804	July 8, 2019 2:55AM	marcogallo1986	Would be cool to go to the above mentioned, except someone else obviously would drive I’ll be in the passenger seat, only way for me to do it. I will stay let me drive one of those slowly around the track with someone next to me, which I doubt they would do due to legal reasons ha ha Ha.
805	July 8, 2019 3:17AM	nyccarguy	Marco - you can go and pay to get driven a few laps in a pace car (a modded Mitsubishi Evo).
806	July 8, 2019 3:55AM	andres3	"So I didn't refuse my first right of refusal, but I made a mistake; car's going back within the 7-day return policy (no punch officially).

Main reason: both bumpers were poorly repainted with bad color matching, surprised I overlooked this but I did notice a blemish that indicated the rear bumper had been repainted.
Side reasons: death by a hundred nails (aesthetic blemishes; even the resprayed back bumper is slightly scuffed/scratched). Car looks like it's worn and torn 75K, not 28.5K.

At Carmax price, needed to be a 9 out of 10 or better, and this isn't the car. Mechanically, and drive-wise, it's a 10 though."
807	July 8, 2019 4:04AM	28firefighter	See if you can get CarMax to make it right. Just bumpers...
808	July 8, 2019 4:13AM	Michaell	"I've done that, as well, on my last trip there.

I rode in the back seat - that was not a good choice.

I'd much prefer to be the driver, at those speeds."
809	July 8, 2019 4:29AM	andres3	"Yeah, but I'm figuring $1k PER BUMPER, for a total of $2K to make it right to Audi standards, if I'm lucky at CA rates.

Still, your idea of Carmax making it ""right"" rather than lowering the price (which they are loathe to do), is a good idea. If not, goes back, no big deal.

The big deal with bumpers is if it was a standard color (white/grey/black) then it wouldn't be a big deal. The purpose of Misano Red is to seek out a rare and beautiful color, but if the condition is crap, well then, what's the point?

The fact they've both been resprayed also tells me that Carfax/Autocheck are barely worth the web-space they take up.
Might as well get the one with a dirty car fax for $4K less."
810	July 8, 2019 4:50AM	28firefighter	"Completely understand the line of thinking, particularly given the CarMax premium. But they aren’t going to want to unwind this deal, and my guess is if you notice it, someone else will, too.

No harm asking."
811	July 8, 2019 11:57AM	nyccarguy	For all of us, I agree. I don't think they'll let @marcogallo1986 drive for obvious reasons.
812	July 8, 2019 12:27PM	kyfdx	"Cool thing this weekend..

Local general aviation airport had vintage aircraft in, starting on July 4th, offering flight rides, etc. They had three Huey copters from the Vietnam era. On Saturday, the helicopters did a flyover of the Reds stadium, and went right over my house, on the way. I'm about three miles from the stadium, so it was pretty cool, but not that low. (also, I'm three miles from the airport, as the Huey flies).

Yesterday, I was on the back porch, and they came over the ridge... all three of them. Doors open. Circled over the house twice, low enough that I could wave to the people inside. So loud, I couldn't hear my wife speak. It was like being in Apocalypse now."
813	July 8, 2019 4:30PM	andres3	"Yes, it's very noticeable, and the average Audi buyer will ""probably"" notice it. There's a lot of money floating around out there, and the way the car drives can make you overlook things, at least for a few minutes (it did to me).

They told me returns were simple fast, no questions asked! 4 documents to be signed is what they said, completely unwinding the deal fast and EASY, with the only fee being days of interest if you keep it more than 3 days which is the contract buyout period (but the limit is 7 days anyway on returns). Part of the Carmax premium covers this 7 day return period without hassles/fees (or so I hope, and will test out soon).

Even if they agree to fix the two bumpers (and some silver paint on the door), they'd have to unwind the deal and have me rebuy it AS IF for the first time, or:
1) extend the warranties from the day I get the car back after repairs
2) extend the return period for 7 days after I get the car back from repairs.
3) Probably lower the price $1,000 unless they do a stellar job (unlikely with CA body shops).
4) Potentially use a body shop of my choice which may mean 1-month delay since they are busy.

In light of the above, I'm thinking it's better if we just unwind and redo at a later date. That way I'm not on the hook for insurance, fees, taxes, costs, and running timelines with expirations while the car sits in a body shop for what could be a long time (especially since body shops in CA are known to not get it ""right"" on the first try).

I'm thinking they take it back, fix it, and I'll give them a first right of refusal again, as I am interested in the car if it was in 9 out of 10 or better condition. Restart the timelines, pretend I just did the right thing Sunday and told them to do the above without signing paperwork. Heck, we could use the same paperwork, just redate it , remile it, and initial the changes.

Carvana offering $1,624 more than Carmax on the Alltrack put me in TOO GOOD Of a mood! Vroom came in in the middle of Carmax and Carvana. Carvana has the BEST business model by far in my review of the two companies, though I may be biased by 1,624 reasons."

His son bought on my engine and transmission combo but are you won’t tell me what you paid creed engine for his Dodge dart that he has he’s like I would’ve been happy just to keep an original engine and transmission getting it running good but my son surprised me so he’s all happy so I said me and you gonna drive it one day.
824	July 9, 2019 2:35AM	28firefighter	"@qbrozen - you’ve had your 3er for a while now. What are your thoughts on having the 4 vs the 6 cylinder?

A 430 GC popped in my area with M sport, Adaptive Suspension, and HK stereo. Looks interesting but not initially something I was targeting."
825	July 9, 2019 9:15AM	qbrozen	"Hmmm... which 6-cyl? It definitely does not have the punch of the 135i or CTS V Sport. It feels a bit better than the VQ35. The Alfa’s 4-pot was a little more responsive and flexible, I think. But I am pretty satisfied with the bimmer. It comes alive in Sport+, and I never find myself wishing for more. And I certainly have never gotten this kind of mileage from any boosted engine before.

I think it only lacks in the handling department, and just slightly. Less body lean and more responsive steering would be welcome.

The overall package is still top notch. I mean, here I am 6 mos in and still think another BMW lease after this will be one of my top choices."
826	July 9, 2019 1:22PM	28firefighter	This answered my question. I meant the Bimmer 6 cylinder you’d find in the 440.
827	July 9, 2019 6:17PM	breld	FWIW, I really enjoyed by 428 GC for the time I had it. It's a great overall package. That adaptive suspension (which I did not have) would be an impressive addition, I would think.
828	July 9, 2019 6:18PM	tjc78	"I shouldn't be shopping yet, but this is tempting.

2019 Volvo S60 T6 Momentum AWD
MSRP: $46540

36/10K - $407 w/ $2300 OOP."
829	July 9, 2019 6:29PM	Michaell	"That's a lot of car for the money.

How easy would it be to exit the Elantra lease early?"
830	July 9, 2019 6:32PM	tjc78	"It goes back November 7th, so that's 4 payments @ 210.

Do I pull the trigger now and pay $840 to get the deal or wait until Oct and see if the deals are the same?

Truth be told I haven't driven an S60, but absolutely loved everything about the current gen S90 I drove and that was the smaller engine."
831	July 9, 2019 6:38PM	tjc78	Edit.. it's due back Nov 7th so that should only be Aug, Sept and October's payment ($630) I haven't kept a lease full term in so long...

$630 over 36 months would be an extra $17.50 added onto the Volvo payment.

Can't tell you what the S60 programs will look like then, But $425/mo for a $46K car is still a darn good payment."
833	July 9, 2019 6:56PM	stickguy	That a real offer or Volvo ad one? I assume that doesn’t include all DMV, tax, etc. but seriously nice car, if it’s big enough for you.
834	July 9, 2019 6:57PM	28firefighter	Worth exploring for sure, @tjc78. I'm sure you have been seeing what is being posted out of New England for Volvo - may be worth chasing.
835	July 9, 2019 7:04PM	tjc78	"This is a broker over on LH. It's all in, doesn't have broker fee in post so that's a few bucks I missed.

$38740 selling price or almost 17% off."
836	July 9, 2019 7:40PM	stickguy	Troll locally for a service loaner. Can sometimes get a killer lease on those.
837	July 9, 2019 7:53PM	marcogallo1986	@ TJC, go for it you’re so close the end of the lease why not, and you know what all encourage you in here.
838	July 9, 2019 8:02PM	tjc78	"First things first I need to test drive one!

Going to see if I can sneak away either tomorrow or Thursday night.

The last few payments aren’t really the issue, it’s just a really busy time for us and we have vacation in a few weeks etc."
839	July 9, 2019 8:21PM	28firefighter	I inquired, negotiated, and picked up a car in the span of 90 minutes last week. It goes fast when you aren't doing the dance and you know what you want.
840	July 9, 2019 8:29PM	tjc78	"Yes sounds like how I bought Enclave #2. Few emails, one phone call and a drive to the dealer.

I *think* the S60 is what I want but wanted to test drive some stuff. That’s where it is hard to find the time."
841	July 9, 2019 8:38PM	xwesx	It's only a few months either way, and the Volvo deals will still be around in a few months, so it really comes down to what you feel is best for you!
842	July 9, 2019 8:53PM	Michaell	The deals may still be there (you hope), but inventory will certainly shrink as we get closer to the end of the model year. May not be able to find the right combination of trim, color and options.
843	July 9, 2019 9:05PM	kyfdx	They just started throwing incentives on the S60. If I had four months to go on my lease, I'd wait until the end of next month, at least.
844	July 9, 2019 9:08PM	stickguy	"He's a lease shopper. the right combo is ""cheap"".

I agree with Ky. circle back after vacation and a couple more lease payments."

846	July 9, 2019 9:15PM	stickguy	T, shouldn't your wife be test driving this, since it will end up being her daily driver to the speedline?
847	July 9, 2019 9:35PM	kyfdx	No extra charge for the marriage counseling...
848	July 9, 2019 10:16PM	tjc78	"I think I’m gonna roll the dice and wait until at least after I make the Aug payment.

Called HF definitely only 3 payments left and due back within 10 days of Nov 7th

@stickguy
She wants zero to do with it. All we agreed upon was the budget. I told her she is getting the Enclave back as soon as the Hyundai is replaced and she said that’s fine.

849	July 9, 2019 10:31PM	andres3	"Just so you know I'm not nuts, I believe Carmax quality control personel must be completely color blind, oh nevermind, it won't let me attach photos.

What a shame because I forgot how effortlessly great the Audi S4 drives! Love the car, but $31K for a shoddy front and rear end car is not right, even if under 28K miles."
850	July 9, 2019 10:42PM	benjaminh	A friend took me in a ride in his brand new custom-ordered Porsche 911 yesterday. Wow. Great car. Accelerates like the Millennium Falcon going into hyperspace.
851	July 9, 2019 10:48PM	corvette	My Zen game was apparently on one afternoon, and some guy who was talking to me on a cold call said he really appreciated my patience and advice, and by the way, did I do short-term loans or marriage counseling?
852	July 9, 2019 11:14PM	qbrozen	Where are you located? There is a broker in the NE with a $55k Inscription loaner for $349+tax and $2500 DAS. And a NEW $51k R design for $369+tax and $2500 DAS.
853	July 9, 2019 11:50PM	tjc78	"I’m in South Jersey right near @stickguy

Those look tempting too!

Trying to get a test drive in this week to at least know if I like it as much as the S90"
854	July 9, 2019 11:54PM	stickguy	I think it is very much going to be an S90 with a shorter back seat and trunk.
855	July 10, 2019 12:09AM	qbrozen	$7k incentives, 62% RV for 24/12, and .00145 MF. Good god that could be a cheap lease! Not really sure I would jump from my 330 to this outgoing 430. Think I gotta hold out for an X2 35i or a 2019+ 330 or 2020 430 (I’m assuming that is the one getting the 2019 330 upgrades). But, then again, if I could cut $100/mo, why not? I’d have to swap mine, which probably wouldn’t be a problem.
856	July 10, 2019 12:29AM	pensfan83	For as much as I love the Acura I could probably be just as happy in one of these 3 series deals with a payment that's $100 to $125 cheaper.
857	July 10, 2019 12:40AM	stickguy	same here Pens.
858	July 10, 2019 1:04AM	tjc78	Without loyalty those BMW leases aren’t quite as attractive, especially on the 24 month terms.
859	July 10, 2019 1:10AM	Michaell	Exactly
860	July 10, 2019 1:34AM	stickguy	"At this point, pretty sure the next car will be a buy. so if it is a nicer CUV but not an RDX, most likely will be a loaner. Even then the price can be pretty steep. Would have to compare to a 1 year older CPO. from what I saw in the past, sometimes the loaners (without extra warranty coverage) can be cheaper even if current MY.

also possible it gets leased if I can make the #s work better, but by that point, should not be any cash flow reason to do a lease to buy. Only if incentives drive it that way.

wife should be excited for the next round of test drives, since whatever we get is intended to be her DD for the next 10 years. which depressingly enough, if we can make it last that long (the current RDX should) it could end up carrying us into retirement, and our 70s!"
861	July 10, 2019 1:39AM	28firefighter	Only $6500 incentives here for 430 GC with loyalty. $7500 for 440 GC.
862	July 10, 2019 3:00AM	andres3	"So Carmax says the color mismatch is due to plastic vs. metal and that it met their ""standards""

Still, pretty smooth process making the ""free"" return, but they do take a while to help you, so plan on half an hour, at least, and they want a full tank in the car (that wasted 15 minutes extra)."
863	July 10, 2019 3:40AM	stickguy	so keep following it. at intervals they will drop the price if it doesn't sell. Eventually maybe even enough for you to get your bumpers sprayed!
864	July 10, 2019 3:44AM	andres3	"Yeah, I don't think it'll sell to someone that isn't blind or at least color blind, not at the current price.

I think the Richmond, CA S4 with slightly more miles and the dirty carfax is the better way to go though. Save the money up front, and probably get a better ""restoration"" than the clean Carfax car. I'm not planning on selling anytime soon once I find the right S4, though maybe I'm in the wrong forum to mention that.

It's a damn great car."
865	July 10, 2019 11:58AM	nyccarguy	"You should really watch what you say around here. Saying things like: ""I'm not planning on selling anytime soon"" give people anxiety around here. I've taken the liberty to correct your post

In all seriousness, IF the ""Richmond, CA S4"" is the one you want, then I would pay to have the PPI done at an Audi specialist. Like many of us, you are very picky about your vehicle (as should be, these things ain't cheap). This is turning into one of those ""buy a beach house"" shows on HGTV. Cue the off screen announcer voice:

S4 #1 comes in his desired color with a clean carfax, but has had some questionable paint work and is at the top of his budget.

S4 #2..."
866	July 10, 2019 12:45PM	tjc78	"The way to do it with BMW is to grab a transfer (that was leased well with loyalty or large CCR) and then you'll have loyalty for the next one.

That $2000 hit on the 24 month lease is just too much"
867	July 10, 2019 1:57PM	28firefighter	Absolutely correct. Or find a BMW to lease where loyalty is less of a hit.
868	July 10, 2019 2:07PM	nyccarguy	Or try to find a dealer that will take an extra $2K off so they can punch a sale
869	July 10, 2019 2:19PM	pensfan83	"I was thinking of that last night too and my curiosity was piqued so I browsed swaplease. We are seriously spoiled by the LH deals because my goodness there is nothing I would take even on a short term lease to get loyalty (330xi for $670/month with 650 miles for 15 months, lol).

I then went on some of the spreadsheets listed and as @28firefighter noted the impact can vary so maybe an aggressive dealer will close the gap with more discount."
870	July 10, 2019 2:28PM	28firefighter	What you have going for you, @pensfan83, is that you live close to the Ohio broker and dealers who are willing to dance a little. The dealers up my way seem to have stopped.
871	July 10, 2019 4:21PM	pensfan83	"100% agree. He had some damn good 340xi deals earlier in the year.

875	July 10, 2019 7:35PM	28firefighter	I'm starting to realize that going out of state to save thousands is probably worthwhile. Unless you're buying a Subaru (and to a lesser extent Honda and Toyota), the market here just is not super competitive. Even the few dealers I've done hacks with in the past are throwing in the towel because they simply don't have to take that big of a haircut to move metal.
876	July 10, 2019 8:03PM	pensfan83	Yep. The only reason I didn't go beyond state borders the past 2 times is because I hit the trifecta on the Audi (right place, right time, right unit) and no one out of state undercut my Acura dealer by more than a few bucks/month so no point in travelling to save $100 over 3 years.
877	July 10, 2019 9:55PM	stickguy	"here is one i like. Pretty good discount for a 2019. I guess the miles are a little steep. But not that many more than a service loaner. Equipped with everything I want, and nice colors.

878	July 11, 2019 1:18AM	qbrozen	BUT, I could get a similar service loaner with 4k miles for $33k-$34k. Loyalty needed.

Is it a great job of the captains chairs they had an old one because I saw a bunch of them left parked next to the new one actually see it in person where the clothes in my face I like the new one better you can only tell the difference from The front end, and it looks higher up to me and the old one, and the gas tank is on the driver side now for the first time in Ford explore history, and not the passenger side anymore, but I discovered that at the auto show wants to go when I saw them there or you were able to go up close and personal with them. No keys in them so couldn’t start him I wish they had keys. Nothing is listed online locally I guess they just didn’t list them yet they must’ve arrived last week or something. Or maybe they just want to clear up one of the 2019‘s before they get listed, the search nationwide nothing was listed online just yet but they’re clearly on there Dealer lot now when I saw today.

This has been driving me nuts. Last night, driving home at dusk, we approached an SUV on the highway. I kept thinking to myself “that thing is BIG.” We got up to the back of it and it was clearly a Jeep product. I wasn’t really thinking too much about it right then, but I kept staring at it, not really understanding what I was looking at. It was like a grand cherokee, but bigger and squarer. Reminded me of a Dodge Nitro in shape. It moved over and as I was passing, I could see on a chrome strip between the taillights, where a Grand Cherokee reads JEEP, it said Grand ....something. I couldn’t see it clearly on the shiny fake chrome in the fading sun."

Think she got the Pathfinder in 2017. So having issues on what they’re going to give her on the trade for the Pathfinder. She still hasn’t told me what that was what they offered her just yet. It’s a silver color forget the interior color. Have no clue how to post stuff on here. I told her is the one in only Carmax in New York in Albany That I read about couple of years back if you were opening, bring it there and see what they’ll give her for it’s more than the Acura dealer she went to is willing to give her on the trade-in.

893	July 11, 2019 11:15PM	28firefighter	"I took an hour today and shot over to my local VW dealer to test drive a GLI. It was a Black 2019 GLI Autobahn 6 speed. To be respectful I made an appointment at an off time and off day of the week mid month. The guy was thrilled to have some company and something to do and i didn’t feel bad about taking his time.

Initial impressions from the exterior are that it’s very conservative looking with just enough flare to remind you it’s a sport model. It is very much reminiscent of an A4. Its also a perfect size for me - not a boat but also plenty of room, mostly in the backseat where it’s most important for a young family to be able to fit large car seats.

The interior is a bit of a mixed bag. From the driver’s seat, it’s perfect. Everything you touch is soft touch materials and the plastic points are well disguised. The heated and cooled seats are well bolstered and very easy to comfortable in. All of the controls are within easy reach and very familiar VW fare. The digital cockpit is a nice high-end touch and easy on the eyes, though given that the top trim doesn’t have navigation in the US, it feels a little unnecessary. The backseat is spacious and plenty roomy, but that’s about as good as it gets. Every surface in the back is hard plastic and as previously mentioned, no rear air vents. Just weird cost cutting.

I’ll give my thoughts on the drive a little later (it’s almost time for school pick up). It will come as no surprise that I loved it - it feels just like my GTI.

To be continued."
894	July 12, 2019 2:46AM	qbrozen	Nah, not that Commander. I can't seem to find any pics that match up. The chrome strip is the defining feature. The Grand Commander would have been a possibility, too, but that chrome strip is missing.
895	July 12, 2019 2:55AM	qbrozen	"I suppose its possible someone could swap out the chrome shown here for on that says ""Grand ..."" although I don't know why they would. And I definitely don't recall seeing handles on the C pillars."
896	July 12, 2019 3:26AM	28firefighter	"Ok. So driving impressions.

It drives and handles almost exactly the same as my GTI did, except a tiny bit quicker. Very little turbo lag, great pull through the rev range, and a responsive throttle. The fake noise from the soundaktor is annoying.

The suspension is stiff but well balanced in sport mode. In a baffling choice, DCC is not available in the 2019 Autobahn but not in the 35th anniversary edition. Something I hope they rectify in the 2020 Autobahn. Steering is responsive and tight. Plus the steering wheel just feels nice.

The manual is a dream relative to the Viggen. Very light clutch with a nice spring action to it - you can barely feel it engage. The shifter has throws a bit longer than I expected but still shorter than the Viggen and it shifts like butter.

My biggest complaint with the GTI DSG is that in “normal” mode, it felt like it was upshifting just too quickly and in sport mode it would hold the gears too long. Being able to do it myself in a proper manual was quite nice. Yes, the DSG is technically faster but...

Overall, despite its shortcomings in cost cutting, it felt like coming home. Is it a BMW or Acura? No. But at $4500 off plus my $500 partner rebate, it makes a $30k Autobahn $25k + TTL. A bargain, IMO. Sets a very high bar."
897	July 12, 2019 3:56AM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter nice on your impressions of the new Jetta.
898	July 12, 2019 11:04AM	ab348	You see that frequently in mainstream brands. To be fair, how often does the rear seat get used, and by whom? Answers would typically be rarely, and by kids, so there is little to be gained by trimming it and adding features that match the front. Rear vents are nice but in reality it isn't a minivan and cold or hot air will get back there pretty quick.
899	July 12, 2019 11:48AM	sda	I understand though don’t prefer the back seat area being trimmed out significantly cheaper with less soft touch touch surfaces than the front. It doesn’t take too much to provide ac vents to the rear. Extend a tube from the front heat/ac ducting through the center console and provide a vent. The rear ac vent makes a nice difference, especially for us in warmer climates. Front passengers don’t have to redirect their vents to the rear. Rear ac vents and a sunroof were the deciding factor when I bought the EX over the Sport Accord.
900	July 12, 2019 1:49PM	ab348	All those things are possible if you want to pay a bit more for a more premium vehicle. You just need to decide if it is worth it or more of a nice-to-have. There is no free lunch.

912	July 12, 2019 9:13PM	xwesx	"While on the topic of maintenance, I had this brilliant idea that I would replace the transmission fluid in my Q7.

The manual claims ""lifetime"" for it, no servicing, but it seems like an awfully big gamble to pit a $10,000 transmission against a $300 fluid change. With 85,000 miles on the vehicle, I figured it was a good time.

The problem is, with the unit not intended for service, it was a hella-PITA to do the job without specialized equipment. The good news is that I'm rather creative, so I was able to cobble together about $20 worth of parts and pieces to fashion my own fluid pump to quickly, securely, and cleanly add the new fluid to the transmission. All told, I probably spent four hours on the job, but I think it was worth it considering the amount of metallic goo in the bottom of the pan. VAG built it with a large perimeter magnetic area to hold that stuff, but I'm not sure it could have gone more than another 20-30,000 miles worth of accumulation before the magnetic field was weak enough on new material to allow it to start circulating through the fluid. Now that it is reset to zero miles, it should be ""lifetime"" for all practical purposes THIS time around!"

Nice I’m doing the transmission fluid change on your to seven, question flush right and it has the ball where you could insert the new fluid in the bowl we could remove the old fluid right this is supposedly not serviceable which is not good you did it for $300 fluid change beats a $10,000 transmission anytime. A lot of them today or in surgeon supposedly serviceable anymore but they really are in reality. Just a lot of people don’t know any better just to just be like OK this lifetime on poor people like us all in here.

But he is the son of a local big Bakery chain around here, well they used to be bigger, one location burn down about two months ago and they’re finally starting to rebuild that, I have one other location so they’re not as big as they used to be. And he’s told me he’s finishing up business school. Roads good actually liked it better than I thought I would and I was in it for over a little over 20 minutes even on the highways and stuff too.

But even better, electrician came and finished the big projects (main line into the house to a new meter), and put in new box for the new light and cleaned up an outlet in the bathroom, and installed a new dining room light (that wiring was odd). Also replaced a few switches while he was at it. so the place is slowly being modernized. and smelling way less stinky!

930	July 13, 2019 9:59PM	xwesx	I did not flush, I simply did drain/fill including dropping the pan and replacing the filter and seals. Everything I read specifically stated to NOT flush the 8ZF transmission. Happily, the fluid in there looked very nice; a little dark, but still distinctly red with no hint of burn. I think the primary need for changing is just to clear out the accumulation of normal wear metals to ensure continued effectiveness of both the magnetic pan and the filter.
931	July 13, 2019 11:18PM	ab348	"From the ""Angry Transformers"" School of Automotive Design."
932	July 13, 2019 11:45PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest. Nice I’m just dropping the pan and changing the fluid in it and the filter only, that’s a think most of them now so they don’t flush anymore. That’s what I told him to do for me on my 61 Thunderbird I said don’t will flush and the guys like it doesn’t matter could do both I said no so we did that for me I hope I wasn’t there. Back in December also last year or two years ago I just drain the coolant and put fresh in no flush anything like that and it’s green and fine from what people tell me. Have to do a oil change again soon, last one was done In December due again. There’s always been a few oil leaks I’ve had another got worse since the car is actually being used probably for change transmission lines to, there’s some fluid leaking out to not severe yet but will have to be addressed soon.
933	July 13, 2019 11:46PM	marcogallo1986	Only thing I haven’t touched is the brake fluid it’s black so go to change that to no flush. Just drain it out of the reservoir and put fresh what do you think about that. And then it will circulate new system to new fluid.
934	July 14, 2019 1:01AM	corvette	@marcogallo1986, unlike other automotive fluids, brake fluid does not naturally recirculate since brake lines do not loop. I’d recommend flushing the system.
935	July 14, 2019 1:59AM	xwesx	"Agreed with Corvette. This is not a recirculating system, so the only way new fluid is getting down there is through a leak, plus natural osmosis of contaminants (such as water) through the lines. I have a MityVac tool (similar to this: https://www.amazon.com/MV8000-Automotive-Tune-up-Brake-Bleeding/dp/B00265M9SS) that makes the work fast and simple. I just connect the vacuum system up to the first wheel bleeder, put some vacuum on it, open the bleeder, then draw out about half a cup (4oz). Once I have this much out, reservoir is usually fairly low, so I take the new fluid bottle, put an adapter cap on it (comes with kit), invert it in the reservoir, then go back to bleeding. Once the fluid runs clear, I shut the bleeder and move on to the next wheel. My order is longest to shortest, which in most vehicles is: Rear Right, Rear Left, Front Right, Front Left. ABS systems can change the order of length somewhat, but really it is just a matter of preference. Once fluid runs clear in all wheels (much faster for last three than for first), you have fully flushed it and ready to go for next three years (or less, depending on environment).

For most of my auto transmissions, I flush the fluid by pulling the return hose from the radiator, adding a clear stub hose and place that in an empty gallon container, then place the return line in a gallon container with fresh fluid. Start the car and let it pump as you run it through the gears. I have to stop for each gallon swap out (it's fairly fast), but usually 2-3 gallons and you flushed the old stuff out (which is noticeable as dark red or brown fluid vs. bright red fluid). Again, the only reason I did not do this exact technique on the Q7 was because of its design (I had to pull the pan as noted previously) and universal advice to not flush the 8ZF or 6ZF VAG transmissions.

Another fluid often overlooked is power steering. This is another easy one to do: Pull the low pressure return hose off the reservoir (usually it comes in at upper end of reservoir, which is desirable; if you have a design that puts it in at the bottom, take a small section of hose, pinch the end by folding and securing with tape, hose clamp, zip tie, etc, and put it over the connector for the low pressure return). Then, add a stub of hose to the end of this (if needed) and route it to an empty container. Get a new container of fluid ready, turn the key to an unlocked position (acc or on, depending on vehicle, but do not start the engine), and turn the wheel from lock to lock (slowly) while another person adds fluid to the reservoir as it drains out. Once the fluid is bright red / clear/ etc. depending on required PS fluid, you're fully flushed and then just put it back together and top off the tank per indicators.

Finally, differential and transfer case: Again, often overlooked but easy to change. Usually there will be a fill hole and a drain hole. Always pull the plug on the FILL hole first (as they can often be a real PITA to remove, and you don't want to drain without knowing you can fill later). If an older model, like your T-Bird, it probably does not have a drain hole, so you need to remove the cover and replace the gasket afterward. Still easy, just be ready for more of a mess on the drain end of things. For re-fill, I HIGHLY recommend easy-fill pouches. Amsoil came out with these a couple years ago or so, so I don't know if other manufacturers are using them yet, but they make the job so simple I have to wonder why... WHY were these not in use decades ago?!"

951	July 14, 2019 5:51PM	28firefighter	"Parenting achievement unlocked. Sam has been helping me wash the cars recently on the weekend.

Today when we finished he came up to me and said “I like washing cars with you, Daddy.” Cue heart melting."
952	July 14, 2019 6:12PM	andres3	"It's no S4, but it's still a quick car; back in '15 they have the GTI tune of current model GTI's still to today (220 HP but feels like more). The 8-speed transmission makes if a very relaxed high speed cruiser. I do like the effortless lazy fast acceleration of a bigger engine with more cylinders though!!! Windy 4-cylinders are fun, but I like blasting around just loafing a larger engine too. The S4 reminded me of that fact. There was an S6 in Calabasas, but it was $37K and an extra 2 hours of traffic. South of LA (Costa Mesa Fletcher Jones Audi is doable from San Diego), but Calabasas was a lot more to ask due to the malfunction of LA traffic, even on Saturday.

So.... I saved a lot of money today, and will continue to save via lower insurance, maintenance, and gas usage as a daily commuter for the next 2 to 3 years, and then I'll hopefully be able to get something extra special (delayed full gratification). And I finally got my first beige interior car in my lifetime that I've long desired from Audi since my A3 (got it in gray but would have preferred beige). My Dad's Lexus ES300H was making me jealous of the interior color!

I also miss a DSG transmission somewhat; I just love them for their more natural feel. A more mechanical and aggressive feel, with snappy/sporty shifts, whereas the 8-speed tiptronic is buttery smooth, but just not as snappy, different personality. I believe the B9 generation A4's get the upgraded transmission, whereas the new S4 doesn't, in a opposite reversal of roles from the B8 generation ('09-'16).

Edmund's is making pics difficult. Can no longer attach them easily. Advise on setting an easy hub for photos without cost for a ""URL?""

Carvana was cool smooth and fast!!! Their business model seems to fit this forum thread to a T. They are like CCBA adrenaline. I liked trading a VW w/ black interior for an Audi with half the mileage for about $6,500 all in all out the door."
953	July 14, 2019 6:19PM	andres3	"Speaking of which, Audi Mission Viego is 15 miles from Fletcher Jones Audi in Costa Mesa.
They had a VIRTUALLY identical car!!!!

Differences were limited to only the list below as follows:

Mine:

'15 16K miles, aluminum accents condition solid 9.5 out of 10 $21,890 (lowered multiple times on the lot over 50 days!) .

Mission Viejo's:

'16 28K miles, wood accents (nice!), condition 9 out of 10, rear windows tinted darker (seemed like a good job), but asking $25,000 and didn't seem very interested or motivated in going lower (talked about dealers in area going to Carmax price model). Only on the lot less than 2 weeks.

My balancing act intuitively said the mileage and model year difference effectively cancelled out as a tie. Do you all agree? So it came down to price and condition. Of course, the '16 also gets about another 10 months of warranty I think (not quite a year due to sale date).

LOL... in my sick twisted mind I know where to go to replace my A4 if someone totals it on my way home.... fortunately, no collisions to report"

Would like to see this fixed.

My wife and I took the TLX on a trip to Dayton, Ohio, to see the Dayton Institute of Art, the National US Air Force Museum, and America's Packard Museum. All fascinating! Stayed at a B & B and went out for some nice meals. On the drive back the TLX got 39 mpg with the AC on going c.60-75."

961	July 14, 2019 11:53PM	jmonroe1	"Congrats on seeing the end of the job coming up. Just remember what I said in the other Edmunds forum about you now being ""The Guy"" in your family from this point on. It's not as bad as it could be. Do you really want to hear your daughter and son tell you about how badly they were gouged when they had to call ""A Guy"" that they found in the Yellow Pages or on Angies or Craig's List?

Just curious, how much of a workout did you give that multitool that you just recently bought? Doing work on floors in the corners and at the edge of the floors at the walls had to make you glad you sprung for that beauty. More than likely you feel it has already paid for itself without making another spec of saw dust again.

jmonroe"
962	July 15, 2019 1:20AM	stickguy	TJC, the couple of times I test drove an Escape (before getting the RDX, and before leasing the daughter's 2015 Jetta) I remember enjoying it much more than I expected. If your baseline is a prior generation RAV4, should be just fine. Mom sounds like someone that won't appreciate the fine dynamics, but if she likes how it looks, and rides, go for it. I can walk to the place you were looking at, but never had any luck getting decent offers there.
963	July 15, 2019 1:36AM	stickguy	"well, I did not end up pulling out the multi tool, though I probably should have figured out if it would have been good for cutting the vinyl tiles! Turns out that when the last floor was put in, they undercut all the jambs. so did not need it for that. the only cutting was the tiles, and that was mostly done by scoring and snapping, and little trimming with knife and nippers. Took longer than I expected because of the detail work (angled cabinet, support pieces to notch around, and doors to pull transitions, etc.). Plus had to move the fridge to the DR and get the range pulled out to get underneath it. Probably should have pulled out the various tools but really didn't have a good place to use them. Oh well.

good news, even though took most of the afternoon too, got it done. Around 100 SF total laid down, and once we got the ""feel of the vinyl"" we could fly in the open field! And it came our really well. I need to get a picture of it to go with the before. Looks 1000x times better. and thank goodness, after peeling back a few layers of old stuff in the bad corner, a few products like natures miracle, and a lot of oil based Kilz spray cans, the cat pee smell is basically eradicated. Nice to be able to actually go in the kitchen without a breathing apparatus!

daughter is very excited by the result. She wanted to stop back this evening when we were out running errands to see it in a different light!

and due to time (as in, not enough left), and the fact that a guy that sits at a desk for a living and is pushing 60 can only be beaten so hard before he wears out, and the kitchen floor was not even supposed to be on the list, I waved the white flag on installing the vanity and faucet in the bathroom. I am not big on plumbing, and the existing pipes/valves are pretty old and crappy, so if something breaks or doesn't work as expected, I stop and call in the pros. so they are just having the plumber friend of his do it (getting new shower controls at the same time). at least if he snaps off the shutoff valve, he can replace it!"
964	July 15, 2019 1:39AM	stickguy	"I think the wife really wants a new car. had hers today (hauling stuff to the construction zone!) we got in at the end of the day when it had been sitting outside in the heat, and she said ""this car smells old"". So we compromised with promising to get a vent mounted air freshener. Cheaper than a new one!"
965	July 15, 2019 1:56AM	nyccarguy	"@andres3

I completely misread your post! You got an A4, not an S4. Seems like you got a sweet deal on a car you are going to thoroughly enjoy!"
966	July 15, 2019 12:03PM	sda	I think my wife is starting to get the itch as well. Took the Pilot for service, needed rear brake pads replaced and I went ahead and had the oil changed a little early at 4700mi. Saves me a trip in the next few weeks. She cautioned if they find anything wrong that will cost $$, I think we need discuss its replacement.
967	July 15, 2019 12:10PM	stickguy	"she would love it I think. But would not want to spend the money now. so it will have to wait. We take my car whenever we go someplace together and on trips, other than stuff like vacation to the beach.

only way it would happen is if one of these lease deals of the century fell into my lap, and Carvana decided they desperately wanted my RDX at the same time. Even then, probably not.

2 years from now,will be into Acura pull ahead territory so all bets are off! Plus, even though it turns 7 in 2 months, we still have not cracked 55,000 miles on it."
968	July 15, 2019 12:12PM	sda	Speaking of replacement my wife has taken a liking to the Audi Q5. I drove a very nice 16 Premium Plus yesterday, white with beige interior and wood trim, 21000 mi. I think it is a bit overpriced at $26.8k. I liked it but had a constant vibration above 50 mph. Not sure if it was tire related or worse. Quick question as I didn’t get to demo it, is the Bang &Olufsen stereo that much better than the standard Audi stereo? The B&O, as I understand it is an option on the Premium Plus. I will include that in my search if it makes a nice difference. I think I may have a punch later this year.
969	July 15, 2019 12:16PM	tjc78	"I was talking to my wife about the Enclave. If we get a GM pull ahead again I think if the deal is right I may do one more Enclave for the family truckster. At least this one is a new design.

Reason being is that part of the pull ahead included a $1500 damage waiver plus obviously no disposition fee. This should nearly wash out the uh-oh my wife did to the passenger door.

Obviously is the lease on Enclave is stupid (which is very possible as the one I have isn’t that great) all bets would be off.

Still have plenty of time for that one, have to deal with replacing the Hyundai first."
970	July 15, 2019 1:14PM	sda	Have you had an estimate made for the uh oh damage? I was floored when a minor scrape on the driver rear quarter and bumper caused by a hit and run parking lot bump up ended up costing near $3k. The only part replaced with the tail light which only had a minor scratch and was not broken in anyway. This was on the Pilot almost 3 years ago.

973	July 15, 2019 2:46PM	tjc78	No, but it’s really just one door and a little ding. I know body work is crazy but I can’t see it being more than 2k.
974	July 15, 2019 2:54PM	Michaell	Now you've got me thinking about the ding on the Jetta.
975	July 15, 2019 3:21PM	28firefighter	"I doubt they're going to hit you for a small ding on it's own. Now, a multi-inch ding with missing paint or a large scratch? Yes.

Also, I think it was @sda who asked about B&O stereo - it was a relatively inexpensive option back when they first started offering it (I want to say $875) and it is money well spent. It is that good."
976	July 15, 2019 3:26PM	pensfan83	Will do. If you see a gray Equinox driven by someone with a scowl give him a look of pity.
977	July 15, 2019 3:28PM	pensfan83	I remember my lease end packet from Audi came with a credit card type device that allowed you to measure for dings/dents and tread wear to see if they were within allowances.
978	July 15, 2019 3:40PM	Michaell	I've got my inspection on Thursday afternoon; I did receive correspondence from VW credit, but nothing to help measure dings, etc.
979	July 15, 2019 4:07PM	andres3	"I can attest to this with recent experience driving the faulty colored bumpers S4 around that had the ""base"" audio system. It wasn't bad, certainly much better than Kia's ""base"" sound system in the Optima, and I have high sound quality standards. The B&O is significantly better though, and I do believe there are more speakers and probably more amperage to power them as well. I'm glad my A4 has the B&O. It wasn't an expensive option when new, kind of silly to not select it at the time."
980	July 15, 2019 4:19PM	28firefighter	Do any of you have any experience with Ceramic Pro? I've heard some great things about it and thinking it might make sense to protect the Subaru from its primary driver...
981	July 15, 2019 4:25PM	andres3	"So no one commented on my question to the group before; it was buried in a bigger post, so I'll extract it here:

If you have one car at 16,500 miles, and another at 28,500 miles, but the lower miles is a '15 and the higher miles is a '16, would you consider that a tie and base your decision solely on price and condition if they are otherwise equal cars?

Note, the '16 would have 10-11 months more warranty (unlimited mileage in Audi CPO)."
982	July 15, 2019 4:28PM	nyccarguy	"Yes. I'd consider those equal cars. The dealer with the '15 might dig it's heels in on the price due to the ""low miles."""

984	July 15, 2019 4:43PM	coldinohio	"i looked into ceramic pro (nanotech) at an indie shop as dealer used LLumar and was quite expensive; also looked at PPF; my new CPO has some paint swirls and windscreen issues...

I think on a new car ceramic pro will make finish last for 5-10 y; you will still get road rash that PPF may prevent; on a dark color, the nanotechnology is really fantastic in appearance....

both PPF and ceramic pro will require car washing etc; not maintenance free

most ceramic pro, etc have yearly 'require' maintenance to keep warranty for the 5-10 years...

hope that helps"
985	July 15, 2019 4:48PM	xwesx	None. What is the coating supposed to do? Just generally protect the paint underneath, or does it have more tangible benefits, such as better ding/chip/etc. resistance?
986	July 15, 2019 4:50PM	xwesx	"I gave the 2008 Focus to my friend yesterday, and I now have my 2008 Forester back. He took great care of it. Two years later, and it looks/feels/smells exactly like it did when I gave him the keys. Only 16,000 miles over that time, too, including a trip to Idaho and back. Almost makes me wonder why he needs a car!

The only issue is a light pulsing in the brake pedal when I slow, so I'm thinking the front rotors are warping. People often say that Subaru rotors are ""prone"" to that, but funny how I have never had it happen on my watch. That said, the 2013 Forester had that issue when I purchased it two years ago (less than 55K miles at the time), and they were bad enough that taking a major grade in BC was somewhat scary. I ended up swapping them out as soon as I got home."

How did you decide to go with Carvana? Did any of us in here talk you into it. I know I sure liked them. Don't know how they beat my dealer by more than $2200 but I'm glad I gave them a try. I damn near gave myself a bald spot trying to figure that out.

1002	July 16, 2019 3:08PM	qbrozen	The ‘16 is worth a little more. 1 yr newer at this age/pricepoint is worth about $2k-$2500. The 12k extra miles is about a $1500 deduct. Add in the extra warranty, and there is a clear winner.

But they charged me $138 and change on both visits which I found to be obsessive. I questioned my service advisor about the duplicate charge and she said it's correct.

Congrats @andres3 on the A4 - the S4 is certainly intoxicating, but given you have the TTS, I'd say the A4 is a perfect complimenting daily driver.

For my rental up in WA/OR, I went with pretty much the cheapest rental deal I could find - ended up with a Sentra. And one with over 30k miles and naturally a stripped model. That was not worth saving the money given all the driving I did over the 5 days I had it.

I have an upcoming trip to San Diego for another baseball tournament, and made a reservation for a ""premium"" car (like a Maxima). That should be much better."

1014	July 16, 2019 10:42PM	andres3	"Can't afford any more tickets right now, as I have one pending ""nasty"" one where the CHP caught me during a momentary burst of acceleration zooming away from the clog of a left lane camper (think Mel Gibson screaming ""Freedom!!!!!"" in Braveheart). Apparently the Alltrack's tune got me into big trouble as I was told I was going faster than I thought. Fast enough where the State wants me to appear the 25th in front of a Judge, and not just take my money over the internet or phone.

I also need to do traffic school for the minor sign violation the cheap $99 lawyer lost. $325 already paid to the State on that one.

The plan for the ""Nasty"" ticket is to plead to the lesser charge at arraignment. For some reason the Officer wasn't confident in his spurious radar reading, only 2 MPH over a threshold, so he wrote me up for exceeding 65 MPH MAX (standard max speeding ticket VC as a 2nd code violation on the same ticket), in addition to the higher charge/speed. Good (not cheap) lawyer's great advice is to plead not guilty to the higher charge, and plead guilty on the lower charge to adjudicate the matter that same day, and get it over with, and offer to pay off the State without a trial. The judge might be hip to the plan right off the bat, because if he accepts, I cannot be tried on the higher charge any longer as I was already found ""guilty"" for the crime due to his acceptance of my guilty plea on the lower charge. Double Jeopardy and all that jazz. Therefore, by accepting my guilty plea, he has to throw out the higher charge that I plead ""not guilty"" to.

So the judge might say he doesn't accept my guilty plea on the lower charge, so that'll force me to dig in and set both for trial with a not guilty plea. That's when I'd have to officially hire my lawyer, who will go all-out full-tilt and try a Keller precedent defense which indicates being charged two codes/violations for the same crime is improper and unacceptable. Given the ridiculous nature of the Court's rumored attitude regarding speeders, the full-tilt defense has been decided by me to be absolutely necessary.

I'm told my CHP Officer is ""TOUGH"" and likely won't plea deal much. I'm told Kearny Mesa isn't the Court it used to be 10 years ago or more when I used to fight my own cases. Their reputation is now that of the Courts where I've had the worst experiences. They want their money, and they don't care how many rules, regulations, or laws they have to break to get it (remember the ignored letters case?). Funny, when I fought so hard for my change of venue in that ""ignored letter"" case, I did so under the stale belief that the Kearny Mesa Court was much better than El Cajon. Things change, and my anecdotal data is outdated by those in the ""know."" Can't believe it's been so long since I got my ""motion"" granted in that Court. The only Court I've succcessfully gotten any Motion to the Court granted while defending myself in a Traffic Case. The same EXACT motion that other Courts would deny for what I consider frivolous reasoning with the same circumstances."

I didn't get 2,200 more, but I'll take 1,624 more anyday of the week. It was so easy. Even the pick-up process was amazingly simple and streamlined."
1017	July 16, 2019 11:01PM	andres3	"Certainly in hindsight and retrospect, it would be better not to attract the attention of those at the CHP that view speeding as ""pissing on them.""

Still, I would have liked for him to actually have been observing traffic rather than hiding behind a curvature in a concrete wall in the fasttrak lanes that means he couldn't see me, and I couldn't see him until he had his radar gun right on me, and by then, it's too late, and he didn't have the ""context"" of the speed. Nor did he ""observe"" and estimate the speed before turning on his radar gun, the way it is supposed to work.

FYI - I didn't have my radar detector installed that day for various reasons. I don't think it would have mattered at the range he was at though.

I also got burned by the fact I didn't think there could be ""2 of them"" within a mile or two, and let my speed get carried away after passing another one that had already pulled someone over."
1018	July 16, 2019 11:06PM	andres3	"He mentioned that about KBB valuing a model year at about $2K, but the problem was they were asking for $3K more! Also, the '16 had some minor blemishes that made it a 9 out of 10 condition wise in my book, whereas the one I got is a solid 9.5 out of 10. Distinguishably less cosmetic flaws, but both were ""buyable."""
1019	July 16, 2019 11:14PM	andres3	Funny, I had the opposite experience mainly due the lower miles car being on the lot for over 50 days, and the dealership does the Carmax model of one low price (supposedly no haggle), but they do lower the price 3 times in those 50+ days. The higher mile one was new on the lot (no more than 14 days), so they didn't' seem as eager or as hungry. I definitely noticed a difference in motivation; I mean, lowering the price 3 times in 50 days is a motivated seller. There was either going to be something WRONG with the car, or I got lucky no one bought it up before me. I think the latter happened.
1020	July 17, 2019 12:53AM	jmonroe1	"C'mon man, that was a mouthful for sure. If I were you in addition to slowing down, I'd be all over your cars looking for a signal beeper that the CHP is homing in on as soon as you start your cars. With your driving record your DMV probably has them installed when you register your cars. Now you know why it takes so long for you to get your cars registered.

1022	July 17, 2019 1:27AM	qbrozen	Decent deal if you want one now. I’m going to hold out, personally. I do have 18 mos in mine, after all. Lol. But if a screaming deal materializes ... we’ll see. My goal should seriously be getting the Dodge done to give me something else to play with, but I have zero free time right now. Hopefully I’ll have my mom settled by early fall and start getting back toward somewhat normal.
1023	July 17, 2019 1:33AM	28firefighter	I’m not in a rush. I have 5 months left as of today on the X1. While another BMW would certainly be easy, I seriously am thinking about the GLI and the new Legacy XT.

No idea where to get those Ally and US Bank numbers, though.
1037	July 17, 2019 2:28PM	tjc78	I saw that, even without the MSD it’s a solid deal
1038	July 17, 2019 2:34PM	kyfdx	"I have a friend with a Passat coming due in three months.

He is in the compact sedan market (3-Series, Alfa Guilia,Volvo S60), or possibly a compact SUV (X1, Stelvio, Tiguan).

Willing and able to travel from Greater Cincinnati to anywhere within a one day drive (NE, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest).

He likes the toys, though, so no strippers. If you hack anything like that, let me know. (something around $50K MSRP for under $400/mo?). 6% tax on the payment, here. Guessing a service loaner would be the best bet.

Thanks for your attention!"
1039	July 17, 2019 2:38PM	28firefighter	Sure - there is a broker in Northeast Ohio that gets some great deals. If I were there, I'd probably save myself the hassle and work with him. Hopefully in 3 months the X1 will be off stop-sale.

Looks like for SXT the MF is equivalent to .00304 (!!) and 56% residual for 36/10.

For RT the MF is also .00304 and 61% residual for 36/10.

For Scat Pack it looks like .00304 and 66% residual for 36/10.

65% for 36/12 is damned strong, though.
If there is $7k IDL money (tough to tell with the way things are labeled), and I managed 10% off before the incentive, I'd be at $440 (440ci is the engine in my current Dodge. LOL) sign and drive on a $49k Scat Pack. Still pretty good in the grand scheme, but not a great deal.

1044	July 17, 2019 3:36PM	pensfan83	I'd love to hack my own deals but there's a lot of good brokers on the east coast whose rates can be paid and I could probably still come out ahead in terms of cost savings relative to what I can get in Pittsburgh or on my own elsewhere. I suppose it comes down to how much time/effort I want to invest. The BMW broker in Ohio is one to definitely keep an eye on.
1045	July 17, 2019 3:45PM	qbrozen	If only BMWs could sound like that, I wouldn't give the Dodge a second thought.
1046	July 17, 2019 3:45PM	nyccarguy	Agreed. Some of the brokers make it too easy and they are extremely great guys to deal with as well. Even if you could hack a deal that could come close, the time they save you will almost certainly make their fee worth it.

1048	July 17, 2019 4:25PM	Michaell	"Sorry to divert the conversation away from lease deals, but I've got a situation I could use some help with. Hoping someone can provide that nugget of information to move forward.

My mom's car is an '03 Sonata with the 2.7L V6. Bought new, and now has a whopping 34,000 miles on it. She is in CA, and the car won't pass the smog testing. We've had friends take it in twice in the last few weeks, and it's failed both times. The feedback we get is that the car simply isn't driven enough, but I don't know how to rectify that. Mom has been instructed not to drive, so friends and family have taken the car out.

What could be the problem, mechanically, that is causing this? I don't have a copy of the report - yet - so I don't know which part of the test is the problem. I'll be going to CA next month for a visit and can get the car into the shop for repair, but it would be good to know what to focus on? Catalytic converter?"
1049	July 17, 2019 4:45PM	28firefighter	That seems strange - no CELs or anything? I'd certainly be focusing on the exhaust/catalytic converter. Though I have to wonder if a full tank of premium and a bottle of techron to clean things out wouldn't fix it...

Did some research on the CA DMV website - they have a program where a ""referee"" will review the situation and try to help get the car passed.

1091	July 18, 2019 1:27AM	stickguy	"top picture is the 1958 vintage bathroom. We put vinyl down over the tired blue mini tile floor. The big hole was uncovered when I took down the nasty medicine cabinet (surface mount). Turns out it originally had a recessed one, and when they ""upgraded"" they just slapped a bigger one over the hole. I will be covering that shortly with plywood and hanging a mirror over it! New vanity waiting to go in until that project is done.

bottom 2 are the kitchen. Shot of the ""archaeological dig"" excavating to the subfloor. That corner was covered by a built in table of some sort (that they took with them) and apparently the cats liked to pee under it. That top brown layer is engineered wood. The corner pieces came up like soggy bread, and stank. had to peel back that much to get to ""solid ground"" A really stupid idea putting that product in a kitchen, even without cats.

Under the wood was sheet vinyl (we had the same exact pattern in our house when we got it in the early 90s). much of it discolored and separated from the paper backing. Under that was the original tile squares (the yellow). Was careful with that, not knowing what it was. The white is Kilz oil based that we sprayed on after treating the subfloor and everything left to get rid of all traces of cat pee. We used some left over peel and stick tiles from the bathroom to fill in the gaps to make it all level, then pulled the rest of the brown wood, scrubbed it all down, but down waterproof underlayment, then snap together vinyl planks. Bottom picture through the door shows the end product. I need to get a better picture of the full field. Looks 1000 times better. Smells better too!"
1092	July 18, 2019 1:44AM	Sandman6472	"We had an electrician come over this weekend and install a new kitchen fixture over the table that blew up about 6 months ago. Changed out the laundry room lighting as only one bulb worked. Got a fixture with l e d lights and it's amazingly bright, but in a good way. Also replaced the outside coach lights on each side of the garage with motion activated ones that will stay on for 10 minutes which is long enough to light up the driveway when pulling in/out of the garage or taking out the garbage. We still are the only house on the block that parks any car in the garage, we park both. The old fixtures were too complicated to swap out bulbs. Had to take out 4 little screws on the top piece, take it off, then go in from the top to change each bulb. Fine when we moved in 32 years ago when I was younger but worsening eye sight and the inability to climb a big ladder made changing these fixtures a no brainer. The new ones are open on the bottom so to change a bulb, just need to reach up and screw them out/in...easy peasy. Not as fancy but so much easier. Let the next owners change them if they so choose. Emotionally, I'm gone from here. Give me $400K, and it's yours, lol!!

1103	July 18, 2019 2:07PM	fintail	I seem to see mostly grey, black, white here - the most common colors for all cars I guess. Maybe a blue one here and there. Saturation sure is true though, sometimes it seems like every other car in the workplace garage is an Outback or maybe Forester of some type. Half with a roof/ski rack on all year for outdoorsy cosplay, which has become a PNW stereotype now.
1104	July 18, 2019 4:48PM	stickguy	Great feature of my TLX. The red makes it really easy to find in a crowd!
1105	July 18, 2019 8:23PM	marcogallo1986	@MB enthusiast, thank you for giving us an update on your dad, praying that all goes well with him, and praying for you and your family.
1106	July 18, 2019 8:26PM	marcogallo1986	Hopefully will go with the neighbor a lot the next couple of weeks to look at a bunch of different cars, police on their CRV is up in September sometime I think, they were talking about getting a pilot I said let’s go look at things don’t just settle on one car go look at a bunch of different models I think they’re looking for something bigger even though they only have one child but whatever that’s their business and I’m good friends with him not going to persuade him but I said let’s go look at a bunch of different makes and models before you go with the pilot. But the husband is very stubborn and you probably do his own thing no matter what I say, well don’t most people ha ha. I know this topic is been discussed in here, but the wife’s more open for listening so I have a chance there. And also to go sit in things just cause I can. I said don’t talk numbers until you find a car that you like to waste your time if you don’t like a car just walk away and that’s it. Am I wrong for saying that?
1107	July 18, 2019 8:27PM	marcogallo1986	The neighbors are in Indian couple by the way, they’re known to be stubborn specially the man.
1108	July 18, 2019 10:06PM	Michaell	"Inspector for the Jetta has come and gone. No issues that were big enough to charge me over - the ding in the right front door wasn't big enough to warrant repair.

The inspector was driving a Focus - he didn't like it at all. 86,000 miles and he's up for a new company car soon. His choices were:

Focus
Escape
Fusion
Altima
Sentra
Kicks

Any guesses as to what he picked?

(BTW, his personal car is a MINI Cooper S with a stick shift)"
1109	July 18, 2019 10:09PM	28firefighter	I'll guess an Escape.
1110	July 18, 2019 10:10PM	roadburner	Assisted suicide?
1111	July 18, 2019 10:18PM	stickguy	my guess was Escape too.
1112	July 18, 2019 10:19PM	xwesx	I suspect he opted for the Kicks, assuming he likes his Cooper.
1113	July 18, 2019 10:22PM	xwesx	"My mother is up for a new tractor at her company. Her current one is a 2014 model year, if I recall correctly, and has about 650,000 miles on it. It's the last of its breed, with a manual transmission, and she is not looking forward to the replacement unit. However, the business metrics say the truck is past due (by about 150,000 miles) for replacement, so she has no choice in the matter.

Apparently, the company went through a rough patch a couple years back, so fleet refresh has a backlog of deferred replacements. She simply told them, ""I don't mind if you just put my name last on the list, but either you get me into a new truck soon enough that I can get used to it before winter, or wait until spring."" She's hoping for the latter!"
1114	July 18, 2019 10:32PM	stickguy	"they running automatics now on big rigs? I rented a lot of Freightliner Ryder trucks (26' box, 26,000# GVW) and they were always Allison ATs. Worked just fine, but I also never had much weight in it.

I did once get an International (before the new freightliner models came out) with a stick. Had to return it. Either the clutch or gearbox was shot, because it was complete guesswork what gear (if any) you were in, and slipping the clutch seemed to be required."
1115	July 18, 2019 10:42PM	qbrozen	If it were me, I’d have no choice but the Fusion. So I’ll go with that for the appraiser.
1116	July 18, 2019 11:03PM	corvette	There was a big expose in the Detroit paper a few days back about the defective dry-clutch DSG transmissions Ford used on the Focus and Fiesta. Seems like there are a lot of unhappy owners.
1117	July 18, 2019 11:05PM	Michaell	"I read that whole article. Almost like the Pinto situation, all over again.

Mullaly must be furious, given everything he did to change the culture."
1118	July 18, 2019 11:21PM	nyccarguy	+1 on the Fusion
1119	July 18, 2019 11:23PM	Michaell	"Bzzzzzzt.

Altima.

I did not comment on his choice."
1120	July 18, 2019 11:24PM	nyccarguy	Didn’t somebody’s sister have one of these cars with a lot of transmission problems?
1121	July 18, 2019 11:59PM	jmonroe1	"I'm not surprised and he probably wanted a black one too.

1122	July 19, 2019 12:06AM	tjc78	Does she drive in Alaska on the ice roads like on the TV show?
1123	July 19, 2019 12:09AM	ab348	"Funny you should mention that. I posted the link to the Detroit newspaper article either here or in Cars & Conversations last week. Then tonight Automotive News sends out a bulletin saying that Ford had announced to its dealers that all of those Fiesta and Focus transmissions are to be fixed for free:

https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/ford-tells-us-dealers-repair-small-car-transmissions-free"
1124	July 19, 2019 12:31AM	andres3	I've realized I prefer the S4 seats to the A4's...significantly.
1125	July 19, 2019 12:36AM	andres3	"Both! hahaha.

I'd say the main fault lies with the CHP officer that didn't let me off with a warning by offering sympathy for his lack of left lane camping enforcement that ""forced me to speed up."""
1126	July 19, 2019 12:41AM	andres3	"Actually, my DMV record is pristine. Like crystal clear. I know because my team checked. Looking into 1-year insurance policies to ""game"" the system should the need arise, from companies that don't check driving records upon renewals. Lock in rates while my record remains pristine. The traffic violator's school is incentive for exactly that purpose, if you didn't know! By doing traffic school, it ""erases"" the record.

My only blemish is that parking lot incident that wasn't my fault that got blamed on me even though I was moving 0.5 MPH vs. the other parties 20+ while watching my rear camera feed, while in reverse."
1127	July 19, 2019 12:43AM	andres3	Really haven't paid much for speeding tickets over the years. Most of the revenue generation has come from my lawyers winning the case ($0 to the State/People), or for red light violation that runs $555, while the sign violation was $290 but ended up being $325 due to my cheap lawyer (but he did delay the payment a good half year or more).
1128	July 19, 2019 12:58AM	marcogallo1986	It’s a common Jen problem with the current generation last generation focus yes, cleared for stepping up to the plate and fixing them for free. I have a friend of mine who is had one since 2012 as well over 100,000 miles has had no issues as far as I know, he’s the type of person that would complain if he did but he has it he loves it. I’ve been in the car a couple of times maybe three seems good to me too. But I own one no just a car overall it’s OK brother have a scape or age or even current generation new Ultima with another friend of mine has numerous times she got it back in February drives good they tuned free tea well the best one they’ve told yet better than the one in my moms room just as good as the one that was in her Maxima.
1129	July 19, 2019 12:59AM	marcogallo1986	Hi Michael, I’m going to guess that your inspector will get either the new generation Ultima, or escape potentially fusion, I know you’re supposed to only have one guess but definitely the kicks his out, even I don’t think I’d want that movie inside but so slow from what I read. And the focus he doesn’t like it so why would he get another one.
1130	July 19, 2019 1:01AM	28firefighter	Mine. Still has it. It’s been fine since its 2nd transmission replacement.
1131	July 19, 2019 1:02AM	andres3	"You expect CA to have common sense legislation, regulation, and laws? Hahahahhah!

There was a stabbing and home defense near me where a gun came in handy (in the news yesterday). I'm no gun fanatic, but apparently some idiot made a ""lock it in a safe so it takes you forever to use it when you need it in an emergency"" rule that would have prevented the right thing from happening yesterday.

Anyway, how about exempting all cars once they reach 25 years old? Instead of the static date CA uses."
1132	July 19, 2019 1:03AM	nyccarguy	See, I do pay attention
1133	July 19, 2019 1:59AM	xwesx	Oh, no. She has it way tougher than that. She rolls the I-5 corridor between Salem and Tacoma, round trip, five days a week! Oh, the stories she tells....
1134	July 19, 2019 2:14AM	stickguy	nice 400 miles a day, probably with lousy traffic for much of it. But must be nice scenery, though doing it every day, probably have every tree memorized.
1135	July 19, 2019 2:38AM	xwesx	"Yeah, I think it would get real old, real fast. When the loads are ready on schedule, she doesn't have too bad a time of it. She typically leaves the yard, just north of Salem, at about 0300, so she gets through Portland before things get crazy. On the way home, if on schedule, she is back at the yard by about 1500, again keeping traffic reasonable. However, the real trick is getting through Portland without there being crashes. If there are, all bets are off. She has sat in traffic so long that her allowable time ran out, and then she ends up spending the night in the truck and cannot finish the trip until after midnight.

That sort of thing can snowball, too, because she's now low on time for the next day's trip, which means it has to go hiccup-free to make it back that day.

Not my idea of a fun job, tbh. I like to drive, but I don't think I would like to do it as a living."
1136	July 19, 2019 4:34AM	mb_enthusiast	I test drove a BMW X7 xDrive40i today...yawn...
1137	July 19, 2019 5:52AM	qbrozen	Were you expecting to be excited driving something that large? Pretty sure cruiseship captains aren’t exactly on the edge of their seats. ;b
1138	July 19, 2019 6:19AM	mb_enthusiast	"I wasn't expecting to be excited. I thought the driving dynamics were unremarkable compared to my 2010 GL450, frankly. I had been anticipating an improvement over a 9-10-year-old car. It handled like a pig and felt every bit as big as it is.

I hope the 2020 GLS with E-Active Body is as good as everyone is saying it is. They don't have any demos with it on the 2020 GLE in my area, so I'm not hopeful that I'll have a chance to see if it's worth it before placing an order, unfortunately."
1139	July 19, 2019 11:36AM	nyccarguy	That C8 Corvette is incredible!
1140	July 19, 2019 12:00PM	nyccarguy	"@andres3 - I see why you were hung up on a red S4. Waze re-routed me through 12 (ish) miles of back roads last night due to the insanely heavy Thursday night summer ""getaway"" traffic. Now these aren't the sweeping canyon back roads like you have out west. They are local, residential streets with low speed limits, lots of turns, curves, ups, & downs. Excellent place to test out what a car's steering and suspension are really made of. My Infiniti Q40 doesn't exactly shine. Anyway, the stunning, red S4 intentionally blew a stop sign (he didn't roll through it or even attempt to slow down) and was in front of me. Luckily I ALWAYS leave room in front of me. The roads were wet. My Infiniti was all over the road when I pushed it. Body roll. Squealing tires. Stability control light flickering. That S4 stayed flat and completely composed. He wasn't going slow either."
1141	July 19, 2019 12:09PM	tjc78	What tires are you running ?
1142	July 19, 2019 12:10PM	tjc78	Doesn’t sound like fun at all!
1143	July 19, 2019 12:13PM	tjc78	"I’m going through something similar with Long Island. I have a job going up there and need a lot of backhaul off the Island. No trucker will touch a pickup after 5AM because they are afraid with traffic getting caught and timing out.

My PM up there is having trouble getting help that early. Fun times."
1144	July 19, 2019 1:29PM	graphicguy	"My son had a Fiesta with that wonky DSG trans. It was bad....very bad. I wanted him to file a lemon law claim. He wasn't up for the fight after seeing what I went through with the Cadillac.

1146	July 19, 2019 3:08PM	28firefighter	Minor rear end collision in the X1 today. We were at a red light and some younger guy drove his Jetta into us. Minor damage but still really annoying.
1147	July 19, 2019 3:17PM	tjc78	That's brutal... near the end of the lease too which makes it worse!
1148	July 19, 2019 3:18PM	tjc78	HMM, that's a good tire so I guess it's not that!
1149	July 19, 2019 3:33PM	nyccarguy	"Glad everyone is OK. Hopefully his insurance will cover everything. The best part of leasing, get it fixed & the ""hit"" is now BMW's problem."
1150	July 19, 2019 3:36PM	fintail	"The C8 does look impressive, GM has a hit on its hands, I think. Nice to see they still have it in them,

Yesterday in stop and go I5 traffic, a distracted Ram driver missed rear ending me by a couple inches, not a fun feeling seeing him approach too fast. I had the Distronic on, which is most useful in either a crawling slog or open roads."

1156	July 19, 2019 4:18PM	pensfan83	Yep, I was irritated last year when the Acura had the hit & run but once it was repaired I realized the car looked like it did prior AND any dings on its Carfax are the problem of AFS.
1157	July 19, 2019 4:35PM	28firefighter	"I went ahead and, as a precaution, filed a report with WSP so I could have a report number. It was a kid and the parents want to handle it outside of insurance which is fine - I have their info if they choose not to. Headed over to a BMW collision center this afternoon to get an estimate.

I'm guessing $500 or less..."
1158	July 19, 2019 4:37PM	xwesx	"Gotta love texting, eh?

Glad it is just a fender bender and no injuries included!"
1159	July 19, 2019 4:42PM	28firefighter	He swears he wasn't texting and to some extent, I don't care. Thankfully Sam wasn't in the car and thankful it wasn't the Subaru...
1160	July 19, 2019 5:47PM	graphicguy	Thanks, Marco. It's all in the past. We both now have a car we both love. So, all's good.

I'll streetlight to streetlight race anyone in the wet, LOL. It's sort of like your average dude trying to race Ussain Bolt during his prime in a 100 meter dash.
1168	July 19, 2019 7:34PM	au1994	"Crab cakes all the way. Did a bucket of steamed crabs once and the only reason I finished it was b/c I was a poor college student on spring break. The rest of the table got to enjoy copious amounts of beer waiting on me to finish.

I can do crawdads for some reason. Pinch the head and squeeze the tail. But as a snack or appetizer only."
1169	July 19, 2019 7:36PM	andres3	"But what happens if the ""fix"" forces you to return 30 to 60 days after the lease expires? Who pays for that, and how much?"
1170	July 19, 2019 7:38PM	28firefighter	You talk to the leasing company. My guess is they'll let you ground it while it is being repaired.
1171	July 19, 2019 7:39PM	andres3	Guarantee if he wasn't texting he was changing the radio, dialing a number, or otherwise somehow distracted.
1172	July 19, 2019 7:39PM	kyfdx	Looks like work...
1173	July 19, 2019 7:40PM	au1994	Hate to hear that. Sounds like its minor and everyone is ok. Royal PITA to have to deal with this on a car that’s on its way out. The upside is maybe you’ll get a cool loaner from the dealer.
1174	July 19, 2019 7:43PM	28firefighter	The BMW CCRC up this way isn't officially associated with the dealer, so I'm sure there won't be a loaner car.
1175	July 19, 2019 7:58PM	tjc78	So worth it... I don’t do those out. Cook them home if I’m going to eat them
1176	July 19, 2019 8:15PM	kyfdx	We’ll see. Of course, we’ll be at a crab shack, if we do it
1177	July 19, 2019 8:25PM	ab348	A quarter-century ago I was part of a group of 8 guys on a week long golf trip to Myrtle Beach. We went to a seafood place one night for dinner and a few of us ordered soft-shell crab. When it arrived we were befuddled because there was a whole bunch of them piled high and they had a batter all over. It took a while before someone took pity and told us that you were supposed to eat the entire thing, soft shells and all. We didn’t make a big dent in them. I think we stopped at Wendy’s on the way home.
1178	July 19, 2019 8:28PM	Davercee	Man, that would be a bummer. Good thing you found a Wendy's on the way home.

1180	July 19, 2019 8:31PM	qbrozen	"So the A pillars didn't spontaneously explode?

Actually, I have a related question. Is the X1 stop sale only on certain years or vin numbers? Saw a broker just posted one, so it made me curious."

I saw that same post with the X1 and I'm not sure, but I did read elsewhere that the stop sale component was lifted. Not sure how or why."
1184	July 19, 2019 8:57PM	sda	Unacceptable, looks really bad. Did you lose any money returning it? This was some years ago, IIRC, if you return a car within the allowed timeframe, with the exception of sales tax, you are made whole.
1185	July 19, 2019 10:18PM	andres3	"No money lost. Just had to fill the gas tank (was given to me full). I suppose I lost my own interest on my down payment, but since I did it within the Carmax return period, they really did live up to the ""NO OBLIGATION"" model for 7-days.

I returned within 3 days.

After 3 days, your buyout option expires for financing, so if you financed, you'd be responsible for interest charges for up to 7 days. No other fees. They simply unwind the deal.

CA law allows used cars to be sold without a return clause only if the buyer SIGNS IT OFF. However, Audi dealerships charge $500 for the priviledge, so everyone signs off on the return rights! They are allowed to charge, but by law, they have to at least offer a cooling off period. On new car sales no cooling off period requried at any price."
1186	July 19, 2019 10:43PM	andres3	"Since pictures are fixed, on the bright side, it's the interior of my new A4 that sold it, so here are some interior shots of the new car (new to me) punch:

1200	July 20, 2019 8:10PM	28firefighter	I don’t know. Didn’t spend any time looking.

My wife said we smell like fish and sweat. (Only 97)

I think we are going to skip the steamed crabs."
1202	July 20, 2019 8:17PM	nyccarguy	"Every year we close our family plumbing supply business at the end of July for 2 weeks. Today was officially my last day of work until August 5. As the great detective Axel Foley once said: “I’m on vacation!”

With the bar mitzvah getting closer by the day (11/9/2019), we didn’t plan anything too crazy. Doing anything with 5 people gets expensive even when you are on a limited budget. So we decided to head up to Canada. Leaving Monday, we are going to drive to Niagra Falls then head to Toronto on Wednesday and then back home on a Friday. The 2nd week we will just hang around and do local stuff (beach, pool, beach, rinse & repeat)."
1203	July 20, 2019 8:23PM	Michaell	Sounds like a great trip. I was lucky to see the falls, from the Canadian side, years ago on a business trip.
1204	July 20, 2019 11:17PM	andres3	did you offer to waive the rental car? I'd pay up to 1K in a heartbeat, but a rental car might make me balk.
1205	July 21, 2019 1:58AM	marcogallo1986	@ 20 firefighter, yes at least the car will get fixed not too bad and the damage estimate. And the main thing is no one was hurt you or Sam your wife or anyone.
1206	July 21, 2019 1:59AM	marcogallo1986	@ New York car guy, thank you for describing the picture above I was going to ask about it. And enjoy your vacation to Canada, that’s exactly where I went over to years ago in Niagara Falls and Toronto I personally loved it. And driving is fun I enjoyed when I went being in the passenger seat even though driving one day is going to happen. And it’s good to weeks away from the business little break well needed.
1207	July 21, 2019 2:03AM	sda	Unless things unravel, punch tomorrow.
1208	July 21, 2019 2:13AM	thebean	@nyccarguy, hopefully the weather will cool down a mite up there. We’re used to it, but you guys up there suffer.

1210	July 21, 2019 2:46AM	nyccarguy	Keeping us in suspense @sda ? Are you going to be the 1st one in the group to register a punch on your card with a Passport?
1211	July 21, 2019 3:54AM	xwesx	that's so bad... it's incredible!
1212	July 21, 2019 1:42PM	graphicguy	"Marco....it’s steamy here....mid to high 90º with 70%-80% humidity...supposedly it feels like 105º+. We have had excessive heat warnings for about a week.

I took my dog to the local dog park yesterday. He usually likes running around for a ½ hour or so. Yesterday, he walked around for about 15 minutes and came back to my side and just sat. We came back home to the A/C.

I bought a new grill on line and it was delivered yesterday (www.fuegoliving.com). Was going to put it together, but decided to wait for a little cool down.

CBS Sunday Morning just had Cincinnati mentioned about the heat wave.....how animals at the Cincinnati Zoo are staying cool and the heat buckling some of our roads. They suggest to keep out of the heat (reciting the obvious)

Stay cool."
1213	July 21, 2019 1:50PM	xwesx	I saw a Passport in the wild on Friday. I had to do a double-take to make sure I saw the nameplate correctly. Otherwise, it is not all that memorable of a design.
1214	July 21, 2019 1:57PM	marcogallo1986	@XDA we need to know details, is the pilot going or accord? Suspense is killing me ha ha Ha
1215	July 21, 2019 2:00PM	marcogallo1986	@GG same temperatures here, I think tomorrow supposed to cool down here little bit of rain too, but I think by the middle of the week and to be in the 80s again. Yes best to wait and put your barbecue together when there’s cooler weather, thanks for sharing the site we got your new grill from. Yeah the dogs really don’t like it probably more so more than us, my dog stays inside 99% of the time was all for not even five minutes and comes in when the weather is like this. And usually she just likes sitting outside in the sun for hours, Or at night just sitting on the deck in the back staring around and who knows what but she hasn’t done that all week. Due to it being too hot.
1216	July 21, 2019 3:01PM	tjc78	"Yes everyone stay cool!

We have a 14’ soft sided pool for the kids (well we use it too) and the water must be 90"
1217	July 21, 2019 3:31PM	pensfan83	We were going to go to the annual Vintage Grand Prix that's held downtown but we got an invite to spend the day poolside at my parents neighbors. The GP is great but I have a feeling the heat would have everyone wanting to leave within 20 minutes so swimming it is.
1218	July 21, 2019 4:04PM	28firefighter	Some folks I know through school friends are showing cars at the GP. Such a great event when it’s not 103...

Ordered a 30-yd dumpster thinking it would be more than enough. Turns out we filled it past the top, and that does not even include some of the bigger jobs I was looking to do. SIGH. I just hope they take it the way it is without a fuss."

And now that she's gotten a dream car, by any chance do you get an upgrade as well?"
1238	July 22, 2019 12:10PM	sda	Thanks all. We were down to zero car payments so I couldn’t have that! My wife drove the Pilot daily and frequently long distances. She was starting to get anxious, thinking it might break down or need expensive repair due to the age and miles on the Pilot. My arm was twisted to the point of ‘uncle’ and she’s a happy girl. The Accord will remain in the stable for a while.

If you ever wanted to know how to damage $1100 worth of plastic, just tap a late model BMW..."
1249	July 22, 2019 10:31PM	Michaell	"Hey, you lease hackers, any chance of scoring a deal on a GT3? Just had a guy get a quote of almost $3400/mo.

MF is marked up .00100, and the dealer tacked on an extra $15k to the sticker."
1250	July 22, 2019 10:32PM	28firefighter	HAHA. A Porsche GT3? Not a chance. They should buy it.

Saw one deal of an Audi R8 of $30k plus, on a one pay deal."
1254	July 23, 2019 12:24AM	qbrozen	"The ""deal"" is to buy one. A 2016 is worth $120k now. A new 2019 is $145k.

$3400/mo is $122k over 36 mos. That makes absolutely no sense on a $145k car. Was it one that was loaded up with a full other 911 worth of options?"
1255	July 23, 2019 12:56AM	28firefighter	Probably...it’s a Porsche...
1256	July 23, 2019 1:10AM	jmonroe1	"Then where are you going to live.

FWIW, I'd be willing to bet that the guy that wants that GT3 couldn't afford the payments on a Vega. I could be wrong about that but probably not. And next year he'll fall out of love with it and be even more upside down on his next love thing.

1258	July 23, 2019 1:54AM	Michaell	Actually, I may have screwed up the math. MSRP was $145k, marked up to $171k. So, $25k plus

1272	July 23, 2019 7:29PM	28firefighter	To USAA's major credit, they're handling this swiftly. Opened claim on Saturday, saw their adjuster yesterday, and they're issuing payment today along with setting me up with a rental. No argument yet, though I'm waiting to hear from my preferred shop what they'll do the work for.
1273	July 24, 2019 5:27AM	mb_enthusiast	"I was really happy with how my Q8 had no problems...

Now, 2000k miles on the odometer, something is loose in the left B pillar. I hear a clicking and squeaking noise while I am driving. That is very irritating. I have to blast the stereo to not hear it.

The MMI system froze yesterday, and I had to restart the car three times in order for it to work. Audi has set up the system so that basically nothing with the car works without those two screens working.

Today, I noticed that the tailgate latch does not always let go completely, so it gets stuck until you pull it by hand a little.

The first available appointment at my dealer is over two weeks out."
1274	July 24, 2019 5:32AM	mb_enthusiast	They talk a good game at the Semersky dealerships a.k.a. The Exchange Audi and Porsche in Highland Park, Illinois. Might try them. They are the biggest in the Midwest, and they have some in stock. Napleton Porsche Westmont (Illinois) goes down to buy rate easy. Didn't even have to negotiate. Asked them what it was, the salesman said, 'There is a markup here, but we are willing to go to the buy rate.'
1275	July 24, 2019 12:16PM	tjc78	"Thoughts on this deal?

Q50 Signature Edition which has the styling of the Sport 400 with the 300 HP motor.

MSRP $44645 / sell $36250
$396 39/10 all in with nothing DAS (not even first month) except a $499 broker fee.

I know the infotainment is antiquated with no CarPlay but it does have NAV."
1276	July 24, 2019 12:33PM	kyfdx	"Seems like a good deal, relative to MSRP

300 HP is nothing to sneeze at."

1281	July 24, 2019 1:11PM	au1994	"Seems to be a pretty good deal to me, good value for the money. 300hp is fine in everyday driving. We'd all like to have more but...

CarPlay is nice but I don't use it everyday in the Subaru and even then I just use it for Google maps. The X1 doesn't have it, didn't come out till the 18's. I'm less concerned with the infotainment but would want to make sure there some safety nannies aboard. I've become so used to blind spot and a good camera now."
1282	July 24, 2019 1:25PM	kyfdx	Our AWD G37 was a fat pig with 328 HP, and it was fast enough to make your eyes water..
1283	July 24, 2019 1:53PM	graphicguy	"Sounds like a great deal. But, do yourself a favor and drive one in a spirited way (is there any other way?) to see what you think of the steering. I found it extremely “wonky” and at times, I had no idea what the car was doing (nor the steering wheel).

They may have fixed that. But, drive it to confirm.

Said it before, if an Infiniti is your want. Get the G/M...or anything with the 3.7 drivetrain and switchgear."
1284	July 24, 2019 2:12PM	28firefighter	"I’d say drive it to make sure you can tolerate the infotainment. It is pretty horrendous.

Also there is a trim of the 3.0t running around that has no carplay and no Nav. Just triple check it isn’t this trim."
1285	July 24, 2019 2:29PM	tjc78	"Not rushing into anything. Vacation next week, and then the following week two nights away (one business/one pleasure) so not much time to car shop.

I’ve driven that car when it was still a “G”. I really liked it.

The Signature does have Nav, the nicer seats and most of the safety nannies except BLiS. Not sure why that’s omitted."
1286	July 24, 2019 2:32PM	tjc78	"Considering both my cars are slow, 300 HP in the Infiniti will feel like a rocket.

The 2012 LaCrosse I had was 300HP but it such a porker it didn’t feel like it"

1290	July 24, 2019 3:09PM	28firefighter	"The offer on the X1 is ~$21k. My residual is $26k in 5 months. And now, with a smack to the rear and the original damage on it from when it was a loaner, this thing has to be worth in the high teens.

A lot of car for that money though for whomever gets it."

I believe it will be paid off in the next few months."
1297	July 24, 2019 5:16PM	xwesx	"If I could find a buyer for the Q7, I would be free and clear again. As it is, lots of equity in that one, despite the fact that it has suffered about 50% depreciation since I bought it. I should probably just keep it at this point, but I would really like to send it on down the highway.

After driving the 08 Forester and Focus for most of the summer (when not riding my bicycle), I can certainly say that the Q7 is buttery smooth and wonderfully quiet, though. You lose sight of those qualities when you use a vehicle every day.

I get about 500 mile a tank, and I filled it up on May 19.... then not until June 30, and I don't think I have put a hundred miles on it since then. I have more miles on my bicycle (about 650 as of this morning) during that same period."

It felt oppressing. This morning's ride, with temp around 65 and AQI at about 90 (still moderate, but more smoke than last night), was much more comfortable.

I had to skip two weeks ago altogether, though, because we had really thick smoke and temps that were about 90 all that week. I could handle the temp, but I still need to breathe!"

Wife's BMW has a 72 month, 0% note, and with $9400 trade-in, might be even. (after 22 months).

I suspect his resale hits are like a lease payment in themselves. I give it 2 years tops.

I just make sure I like the car before I sign, then no worries about red ink as I won't want to sell. Maybe next time I'll get off the lease carousel."

1304	July 24, 2019 9:28PM	stickguy	RDX is our little nest egg! I assume upside down in TLX but that’s not an issue until lease end and I decide to buy out or return. Likely return, or I will be buying 2 cars!
1305	July 24, 2019 9:36PM	sda	"I hope what I experienced today is not indicative of future interactions. When I was in the process of buying the Audi, I asked if it had two keys. I also noticed someone swiped the volume knob from the console. They indicated the car had two keys and would replace the knob. As I was getting ready to commit to buying the Audi I asked that they confirm it had two keys. It didn’t. Knowing they can be expensive I asked that they provide it. We came to an impasse and I walked. Well, who knew, on my drive home, after disappointing my wife telling her the deal fell thru, they called back and said they would get a second key. The rest of the transaction went well and they have been good to the agreement.

Today the salesman called and said the key and volume knob were received and they confirmed with the Audi dealer that they will pay for the programming cost when I take the car to them on Saturday. All good, my experience with the selling dealer is positive.

I call the Audi dealer to confirm my appointment and that the selling dealer is paying for the key programming. The attitude by the service advisor was somewhat condescending but confirmed the appointment. I asked if they could confirm all recalls were completed which they said the would and also asked that they reset the Service reminder as VW did the service but don’t have the tool to reset the reminder. I got a curt, that will be $70 as we didn’t do the service and you are taking up a technician’s time. Now that’s a good way to impress a potential repeat service customer. We’ll see how it goes.

By the way, if I had to pay for the key, it is $252 for the transmitter, $75 for the internal key and $140 to program plus tax, about $500!"
1306	July 24, 2019 9:44PM	corvette	"Sometimes a local locksmith can do that type of work cheaper but that may not be an option with VW/Audi since I think they have laser cut keys.

Can you reset the service reminder yourself without a tool?

The cool thing about the Nissan/Infiniti smart keys is that you can get a used one and reprogram it to a different car. They just have to cut a key blank for the emergency key. I think it was around $150 to do that on my G37."
1307	July 25, 2019 1:20AM	nyccarguy	That’s a fair assessment
1308	July 25, 2019 1:24AM	nyccarguy	"“The first available appointment at my dealer is over two weeks out.”

Welcome to Audi ownership. I see things haven’t changed much since my parents leased an ‘02 A6 3.0 Quattro back in the day."
1309	July 25, 2019 1:59AM	pensfan83	I suppose it's hit or miss. In 3 years with my Audi I visited 4 times, 3 for an oil change & state inspection and 1 for a recall. A loaner was always ready and the car was done within a few hours each time.
1310	July 25, 2019 2:00AM	xwesx	"Yeah, it's nuts, which is why I have not picked up a second key for mine.

I also do not have the service reminder reset on mine. I think it's been on for about 15,000 miles now. The last time I had it at the Audi dealer in Anchorage for the TDI modification, I requested they reset it. It is asinine that it cannot be reset from the menu system like the oil reminder, so there's no way in h-e-double-hockey-sticks that I would pay a dealer to reset it."
1311	July 25, 2019 3:04AM	andres3	"That must be a regional thing. I've always able to schedule appointments 2 to 3 days out. Pretty sure it's a question on the survey if you felt the time required to wait for or schedule an appointment was acceptable(rated 1 to 10).

That being said, my CPO may have a couple issues. The selling Audi dealership dealers said they'd take care of everything, and to let the Escondido people know my sales managers name and that he'd take care of me (I guess in case something like wheel balance/alignment isn't warranted).

My two issues are as follows:

1) A very slight vibration at super legal CA speeds on the freeway coming through the steering wheel. I suspect it's the OLD OEM P7's (tires) that look like they sat in the desert sun 24/7 for over 4 years. The vibration actually seems to have improved/lessened with miles.

2) I think the AC is blowing 10 degrees hotter than it should be, which is a problem at temperatures over 90. Maybe it just needs a recharge of eco friendly refrigerant......my TTS was welcome as a diversion today as the AC blows nice and cold despite the high temps."

1314	July 25, 2019 6:12AM	28firefighter	Out of curiosity, did you sell it to them with the tune? Any issues with the VW dealer flagging the car TD1?
1315	July 25, 2019 1:30PM	breld	@sda - I certainly hope your future experiences with the Audi dealership are more positive, or you're able to find an alternative that is. That attitude is horrible - it's certainly enough to turn someone off of a brand, as was my experience with my local Land Rover dealer. My experiences with multiple Audi dealerships in the Denver area have all been excellent, FWIW.
1316	July 25, 2019 3:17PM	sda	I am hoping that was an exception. It certainly gave me a guarded first impression. My visit to their service department Saturday will be telling. My wife loves her Q5. She isn't one to say too much, but has come home each night to sing its praises. She says the B&O rocks and really appreciates how quiet the Q5 is.

1322	July 25, 2019 5:49PM	tifighter	This is something that the 3 does well. If you need to replace the key card (even though you'll mostly just use your phone), you can get another pair for $35 and can program/pair it from the central screen in the car yourself. If you lose one, you can just unauthorize it from the car as well. No dealer required.

I got tired looking for it so I didn't look for a couple days. Wouldn't you know it, that's when they must have advertised it. Anyway, when I finally saw it they had it shown as SOLD. They paid me $12,751 for it and it was sold for $16,000 even.

1329	July 26, 2019 12:28AM	sda	Our first week with the Audi Q5 is off to a rough start. On the fourth day of ownership my wife calls me to say a message light lit up showing low oil level. I looked it up and told her it was safe to drive and when she got home I would check it. This car does not have a traditional dipstick, it monitors it by sensors. I followed the instructions how to check oil level and it showed full, plus the message light disappeared. I drove it and all seemed fine. Her 25 mile drive to work this morning was uneventful. When she left work this evening, in less than 5 minutes the oil level light glowed brightly. Again, once home, the oil level said full and the message disappeared. I suspect a bad sensor, but what a pain and an effective way to dampen the enthusiasm of getting a new ride.
1330	July 26, 2019 12:41AM	cdnpinhead	"Shades of the first BMWs with the ""new and improved"" (relative to the stone-reliable dipstick) oil level sensors -- the answer to a question no one ever asked. How often is the oil low relative to how often the sensor is (let's say fouled) up? And, why oh why was the dipstick eliminated? It would be a definite tie-breaker in cases like these."
1331	July 26, 2019 1:16AM	qbrozen	I ain't sayin nothin
1332	July 26, 2019 1:28AM	sda	Thank you sir. A little humor, very little. Lol
1333	July 26, 2019 4:06AM	xwesx	"Makes me appreciate the dipstick on my one-year-older Q7. I spoke with a man who is a retired Audi technician,, and he asked me how I changed the oil. I told him that I drain the pan, and he said that the ""suck it up through the dipstick tube"" method is actually better because the design results in more thorough draining that way....!

I still drained it from the pan this year (as I had to remove the shields anyway since I was doing the transmission), but maybe I'll try it through the tube next summer. If I still have the car. Which I hope I don't, but who knows."
1334	July 26, 2019 12:34PM	benjaminh	My guess is that Audi/VW reliability and durability are still below that of Acura/Honda. My ownership of a VW Jetta long, long ago forever soured me on the engineering and quality VW. But I hope things get better for you and your wife's Q5!
1335	July 26, 2019 12:51PM	sda	I’ve had one Audi in the past and 8 VWs. With the exception of my last VW, a 2006 Passat 2.0t, all were decent cars that were enjoyable to drive and though not as trouble free as the Hondas we’ve owned, were ok. The Passat soured me. A beautiful car, drove great, used oil 600-800 mi/qt, frequent check engine lights, sensors failing and more. It has taken 10 years to jump back in. CU gives the 16 Audi Q5 a better than average repair record. I hope that’s the case!
1336	July 26, 2019 1:10PM	kyfdx	"I always had a chuckle when others would tell me that their XYZ car was just as reliable as a Honda. Then, proceed to tell you the ""small"" list of repairs they had over 5 years, or so..

My 2002 CR-V? 6.5 years, 106K miles. Had to replace screws in the glovebox latch, that had loosened and fallen out. (around 55K) Other than that, regularly scheduled maintenance.

That was our 8th (and last) Honda product. It was a good run."
1337	July 26, 2019 1:39PM	tjc78	"used oil 600-800 mi/qt

That's a very common thing with them. I know three people that have them and they all complain about oil usage.

Thank goodness my cars don't use oil, because I have never opened the hood of the Elantra in nearly 3 years and only a few times on the Enclave to add washer fluid."
1338	July 26, 2019 2:16PM	corvette	Had a dream last night that I sold the G37 and took a cheap lease on a BMW service loaner. It’s been almost a year since I bought a car, so maybe my subconscious is getting antsy.
1339	July 26, 2019 2:27PM	28firefighter	Ah, yes. The dreams of car nuts. My wife tells me it's better than me dreaming about other women.
1340	July 26, 2019 3:11PM	pensfan83	"I took the Nissan to the dealer early this morning for an oil change and other services. It's located on a ""campus"" with other standalone stores part of the same group, Hyundai among them. I started wandering the lot since none of the stores were open. On the back lot were G70's that look like they were waiting to be PDI'd. Among them was a 3.3 AWD Sport, sticker at ~$52K, white over black with black 19"" wheels and summer tires. I'm not a fan of the black wheels but the rest of the car looked really good, first one I've seen anywhere. It's more rounded than the Acura (which looks chunky from some angles) and about a half foot shorter which puts it on par with the A4/330i size wise. I'd love to get behind the wheel of one at some point."

1343	July 26, 2019 3:58PM	Michaell	"Sadly, no.

We're going to try life as a one car family for the time being. Wife and daughter have also been working from home lately, and when the new business finally opens its doors (9/2 is the projected date), they will commute together and I'll have the Outback for any errands I need to run.

MINI is at 38K and the Outback is almost at 32K; plenty of life left in both of them."
1344	July 26, 2019 4:00PM	pensfan83	I think we've become addicted to being a 1 payment family to the point where we want, and will soon need, a replacement for the Nissan but have become accustomed to the extra $$$ every month. That extra $$$ has helped with home improvements and allowed for extra deposits to college accounts.

1352	July 26, 2019 6:23PM	28firefighter	"So I thought I would give a 1 month ownership report on the Outback, though technically that isn't until tomorrow. We have put about 550 miles on it since delivery, which is mostly comprised of our weekend family outings around Seattle as well as my wife's commute to the park and ride.

First, we have zero issues to report. Car is tight as can be with no rattles, squeaks, etc. There was no damage of any kind from when the car was on the lot, so nothing to report there either.

We continue to be thrilled with our acquisition.

The 3.6R is smooth and powerful, albeit not the most fuel efficient vehicle we've ever owned. Average fuel economy with mixed driving is landing in the low-mid 20s. On the upshot, it does run on regular fuel. I know folks are quite opinionated about CVTs, but in this particular application I continue to feel that this one is well matched to the engine and does a nice job of keeping the car in the meat of its power band.

Inside feels like you're sitting in a roomy studio apartment (at least relative to the X1). Dash and gauges are super intuitive and I particularly like how well lit up everything is at night. My wife loves the CarPlay capability and basically doesn't use anything else. The infotainment system seems a bit outdated (though not terribly), but is very responsive and easy to use which mitigates a lot of the outdated feeling. The HK stereo is ""meh"" - better than the stock system for sure but nothing to write home about.

The EyeSight nannies seem to work well, though admittedly I do not use the big stuff. So far I've had the car yelling at me for leaving my lane, trying to change lanes with another car too closely for the car's comfort (but not close enough to actually be a problem), etc. If it were my DD I'd probably dial back some of the sensitivity but my wife doesn't seem to mind.

The last thing I'll say is that I have never seen my wife so attached to a car before. She truly loves it and so do I - it fits our family needs absolutely perfectly. Is it a unique car? Decidedly not. Is it sporty? Nope. But it does everything I want it to and then some and everything it does do, it does very well."
1353	July 26, 2019 7:03PM	tjc78	"Your comments kind of echo how I feel about our Enclave. It just does everything well, they are everywhere and my wife loves it. I like it as well for hauling the family around, loading it up for trips etc.

I asked my wife what she wanted next and it looks like we may be on Enclave #3 next year. They just don't lease that well, but you know what they say..."
1354	July 26, 2019 7:20PM	au1994	"Great write up on the Outback. I really wish I could convince my wife to pull the trigger on a 19 Limited before they are all gone. She's four square against a truck so my pipe dream of the Tacoma is gone.

The bang for the buck on the Subaru's across the model line just astonishes me. I'm also very surprised by how much I love my little Crosstrek. After years of zipping around in one BMW after another the Subie is the right car for the time. No worries throwing dirty and wet things in it (we got all the seat protectors etc) when up at the lake, nor thrashing about dirt roads up there to get to a hiking spot. Yeah, its bog slow but makes up for it in so many other ways."
1355	July 26, 2019 7:20PM	nyccarguy	"@28firefighter - glad you guys are enjoying the outback. It’s one thing to triumphantly park a car in your driveway that you got a stellar deal on. It’s a whole different ball game if your wife is thrilled with said car and it’s color (colour since I’m still in Canada).

Mid 20s isn’t terrible for that H6. I averaged 26 mpg in my underpowered 4cyl Legacy.

The Pilot has been a champ on this road trip so far. We went to Niagra Falls (US, then Canadian Side), Niagra On The Lake (beautiful wineries), then to Toronto. We are now at the Toronto Zoo. Heading to Corning, NY tonight (about 5 hours). Then home tomorrow. I was able to change the digital speedo to KPH. Trip has been fantastic so far."
1356	July 26, 2019 7:43PM	xwesx	"@28firefighter You know you're spoiled when an HK audio system is ""meh.""

I remember when I first did a test drive of the 2010 Forester... The audio system was simply AMAZING to my ears! Both the combination of the vehicle's quietness and the crispness of the sound were just difficult to fathom in a moving vehicle. Our daily drivers at the time? 1998 Ford Escort, 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan.

Now.... (after using my Q7 as a daily) I get in the Forester and cringe at how tinny the audio sounds and how much road noise pushes through."
1357	July 26, 2019 10:02PM	andres3	I find it's hard to go backwards on quality after you've experienced the real thing. No more Kia's for me, not for a while. They've come a long way since the Sephia rental days, but they still got a long ways to go.
1358	July 26, 2019 10:04PM	andres3	"I always thought it a bad trade-off to get rid of the dipstick like they did in prior generation A4/S4's. My TTS has a dipstick, and I prefer that. Having a dipstick doesn't mean they can't have a ""dummy light"" or dummy beep beeping at you for those that never ever check the oil level."
1359	July 26, 2019 10:11PM	greg128	"Have not posted in 3 years since I leased a 2016 Malibu Premier 2.0....it just went back and now have a punch.
The Malibu was a good car..More than ample power from the 2.0 turbo...quiet and comfortable and great tech with all of the options. No reliability issues but only put on 17K miles which was half of what I paid for in the lease. (Mostly driven by wife as I drive a company truck). My 2 main gripes with it were 1: 19"" low profile tires which did not take major road imperfections very well. In fact my wife popped 2 tires during the lease period and
with no spare had to have it towed to the dealer both times resulting in 2 new tires @ $300 each. I was not very happy about that. Gripe 2: Manual says it requires premium gas which I mostly used, but while I saw a 25 mile average of 41 mpg on a road trip, around town in the winter was barely 15 mpg which was worse than the mileage I saw from my 2008 V-6 Saturn Aura which used regular

When replacing the leased Malibu I decided my requirements were:
1: Must have a spare
2: Must use regular gas
3: Must have ample power
4: Must have a NA engine..no turbo which I do not think will not be reliable long term
5: No low profile tires

I decided to purchase a 1 year old vehicle that has already had a major depreciation hit. I also decided on a NA V-6 engine. My choices narrowed to: Toyota Camry V-6, Nissan Maxima, Chevy Impala, Buick Lacrosse, Toyota Avalon and Kia/Hyundai larger cars. I did not consider the Koreans. The 1 year old Toyota V-6 cars are rare and expensive (around 30K) The Maximas look great, are reasonably priced but I ruled out because of the required premium gas, the smallish interior and the Nissan CVT. A 2018 Avalon is reasonably priced, But the V-6 is undeerpowered compared to the new Camry and the tech is outdated (No Apple CarPlay) The Chevy Impala is a bit too big at 204"" length compared to the Malibu 194"". That left the Lacrosse (197"" length) and knowing that it was being discontinued I knew that I could obtain a 2018 for a good price.

I purchased a 2018 Buick Lacrosse Premium FWD with an original MSRP of $42 with 14K miles for $24K and change. It has a 310 HP V-6 and feels quicker than the 2.0T Malibu. Car and Driver has the 0-60 time of 5.6 sec.
In addition the around town mileage now in the summer is in the 17 MPG range on regular gas. The 25 mile best mileage in the computer memory reads 43 mpg. If I get anywhere near that on a trip I will be very happy. The ride with the 18"" tires is smooth and compliant. The interior is luxurious and the tech is very good, in addition to Memory. heated, venitlated and massaging seats, articulating HID headlights, HUD, Lane Keep Assist, Rear Sensors. It does not have a panoramic sunroof which I would have liked, or the Navigation system (which is not needed with Apple CarPlay) It also does not have the Bose sound system which I had in the Malibu but to me the base system sounds at least as good. Annother bonus is that when you buy a 1 year old Buick with the original 4 year/50K warranty it still has the remaining 3 years left...as much as a newly purchased non premium brand. I brought it in to the dealer and had them do an oil change/filter and tire rotation and was pleasantly surprised when they told me there was no charge...and that I get one more service free...Overall very happy with the car."

But here is the aftermath. I made sure to highlight to geico how the damage obviously flows from rear to front, showing the truck plowed into me, because he was claiming innocence.

...sigh... no photo day once again on Edmunds. Sorry, folks. The damage is ugly, though. Punched a hole in the quarter panel and ripped off one side of the bumper. It is going to be expensive."

1370	July 27, 2019 1:42AM	xwesx	"Major bummer. As others noted, though... glad you're okay!

Edmunds, you really let us down on this one!"
1371	July 27, 2019 1:50AM	ab348	"@greg128 , nicely done! A very nice car and a step up from the Malibu for sure.

@qbrozen , sorry to hear about the accident. Glad it sounds like you're OK. Hopefully this system will let you post some pics soon so we can see what happened."
1372	July 27, 2019 2:24AM	laurasdada	"Greg, congrats! QB, sorry, hope you're ok.

So, a couple of weeks after a check engine, ""Evap"" code scare (CEL extinguished after about 72 hours; guessing the old gas cap trick), today a ""brake pad replacement"" warning light came on. Replaced the rears last year, maybe the fronts now? I mean, it can't be an electrical gremlin as I drive a British car...

Wonder if the XF is trying to tell me something?"
1373	July 27, 2019 2:31AM	28firefighter	“I’m bloody British”
1374	July 27, 2019 3:12AM	qbrozen	Oh yeah we’re fine. Thanks. Extremely low speed but of course a big rig does A LOT of damage. Not totaled, no, but I’m guessing an easy $5k. Really depends if they try to fix the metal, but I don’t think they can reasonably do that. And that quarter panel is the entire rear side of the car and extends all the way above both doors and includes the A pillar. That’s a big piece to replace. Plus of course the whole rear bumper plus bumper supports, etc. Dude really dug his bumper in deep.

I recall the long term C&D E wagon test car was totaled because a trailer scraped up against the length of the car, and damaged the pillars. Sounds like a case to defend dashcams, too.

Nice looking Buick there, great colors, no doubt a used bargain and much better looking than a modern Toyota."
1378	July 27, 2019 3:52AM	andres3	"I had a near miss where a few cars decided to slow way down in the fastest lane for no good reason so I just emergency avoidance maneuvered into the adjacent lane to the right to pass on the right.

It was wide open in that lane."
1379	July 27, 2019 3:53AM	stickguy	ouch. Good thing for preset residuals and gap insurance.
1380	July 27, 2019 4:05AM	Michaell	$5k? I'll go on record and estimate the repairs will be double that. I tapped someone in the post office parking lot when I had the Elantra GT and it cost almost $5k to put right.
1381	July 27, 2019 4:14AM	28firefighter	The love tap on the X1 is $1100. I agree with @michaell - closer to $10k.
1382	July 27, 2019 12:18PM	qbrozen	Could be. I have no clue what the body parts cost. Probably... what... $3k in paint? 15 hrs labor is another $2500? So, yeah, you guys are probably closer. Ok, I’ll guess $8500. That’s $3k for parts. I could still be way off of course. We’ll find out on Monday.
1383	July 27, 2019 12:57PM	laurasdada	When I made service appointments for my TL, I always asked for the loaner NSX. Given my usual luck, it was always just given out to the prior service client. Every time! ;-)
1384	July 27, 2019 1:00PM	laurasdada	I had a near miss with a postman yesterday. Made a right hand turn onto Rt.27, a line of cars in the left land stopped for the red light. Suddenly, from between an SUV and box van, a postman is running across 27. Thankfully, both of our brakes worked! And there was no car on my donkey...
1385	July 27, 2019 1:14PM	ronsteve	I'm thinking that 26 in a 2.5 Legacy is either mostly city driving, or back in the pre-CVT days, whereas mid-20s in the H6 Outback is a lot of sensible highway driving.

1392	July 27, 2019 4:51PM	xwesx	"Agreed; going to be a lot! It was $7,600 or so to fix our Forester last year after the ""canoe incident."" That includes Alaska ""tax,"" but mostly that was glass (at first sight). Ultimately, the ended up replacing both passenger doors (fairly cheap in terms of parts), which of course meant paint... and paint is major money."
1393	July 27, 2019 5:10PM	jmonroe1	"@qbrozen, the important thing is that you are OK. As for the dollar value for the repair, I'd say at least 10 grand. When a guy across the street from the flip house barely tapped the lower right rear quarter panel between the bumper cover and the wheel well on my Genny, it cost $1,350. No metal replacement but painting up to and including the roof rail to ensure a perfect paint match. Then when the girl across the street from our house hit Mrs. j's new Subie, when it wasn't even a week old, the cost for that whack was almost 8 grand but the bumper cover, trunk, right rear light assembly and backup sensors needed replaced along with a whole lot of painting.

To me it looks like the whole side of your car will need painting. That's where a lot of the expense will be. I hope I'm wrong with my guesstimate but I'm sure you'll let us know the final number which is usually more than the estimate. You've heard the words, ""we won't really know until we get in there"".

Again, glad to hear you are OK.

1394	July 27, 2019 6:32PM	sda	"Good news. My service visit at the Audi dealership was better than my experience with them when I called for an appointment. They programmed the keys and reduced the oil level a bit. It was slightly overfilled and this was triggering the warning message/light. I requested the Service Soon light be reset, agreeing to the cost. When the car was completed I was pleasantly surprised there was no cost. Without me having to ask and I think VW felt bad about

overfilling the oil, they also picked up the cost to reset the Service Soon reminder. Better yet, I was told that the car had prepaid maintenance that transferred over to us and is good thru the 45k service which represents about $750. I am delighted!"
1395	July 27, 2019 6:43PM	qbrozen	"Thanks for all the well wishes, folks.

Worst part is nobody will want to take over the lease now. Lol"
1396	July 27, 2019 6:50PM	28firefighter	Not true at all. If it’s fixed i wouldn’t care. After all, we aren’t buying...

1398	July 27, 2019 8:13PM	marcogallo1986	@SDA glad it went a lot better than originally thought it possibly could go, how do they go about checking the oil level is there a way you could do it at home I know there’s no dipstick.

@greg128, congrats on the punch. Looks nice and should be reliable and comfortable."
1400	July 27, 2019 9:39PM	corvette	This might have been because the car is still under prepaid maintenance.
1401	July 27, 2019 10:39PM	sda	Good point. Originally they were going to charge $70 to reset the light. I was going to ignore it as I keep up with maintenance but my wife found the message annoying. It was a pleasant surprise not owing anything and finding out prepaid maintenance was transferred to us. A very nice bonus.

those trucks on the turnpike, especially in heavy traffic or tight quarters, always make me nervous. especially when you need to make a quick stop, and they can't. most semi drivers are careful and courteous, but some, are just in a hurry (or worse).

at least it is a lease. Might just have to ride this one to the end though."

I’m out in the San Diego area for a baseball tournament. After having the Sentra rental a couple weeks ago in Portland, I made sure I had a better experience and secured a Maxima for this trip.

It’s pretty impressive. Nice materials on the inside and I almost forgot how great a naturally aspirated V6 can be. And I have to say, the CVT is not bad at all."
1408	July 28, 2019 8:46PM	au1994	"Sorry to hear/see about the accident @qbrozen. It ain’t gonna be cheap! Here’s to hoping the insurance company doesn’t give you the runaround.

@breld - I had a Maxima for a rental about a year ago and was instantly smitten. The cockpit and drivers seat were amazing and the V-6 perfect for the car. I just think it is good looking too."
1409	July 28, 2019 9:11PM	qbrozen	I have yet to talk to anyone. I entered the accident on the Geico app, it asked me a series of questions, I gave a writeup of what happened and uploaded pics (optional), and then it asked me if I wanted Geico to fix it and they’ll go after the other insurance company and try to get my deductible back. I said yes, so then it gave me choices if I wanted to use one of their approved places or choose my own. I opted for theirs because then it gives you to option of one-stop resolution. Tomorrow morn at 7:45, I meet with an adjuster at the shop, they assess, then keep the car for repair and I drive away in a rental. So, fingers crossed it really is that easy.

1414	July 28, 2019 11:15PM	qbrozen	Did it say Tahoe/Expedition? Or is this going to be like their cars where they call a Fusion a “premium full-size” or some such nonsense?

Edit: Never mind, the better rate is through Fox, who has a terrible reputation. Looks like an Explorer or similar, which would be fine, except for the fact that it's through Fox. So, yeah, $100 is still okay for an upgrade."

I don't get why people defend this vehicle so vehemently. It is pretty awful. It is like being a drum with as much noise as it makes over every little pavement imperfection. They took a page out of Subaru's book and added shift points to the CVT. I have no idea why. And, even at full tilt, the thing slurs to the next ""gear"" at just 6k rpms ... so why have a redline marked if you aren't going to approach it?? I thought maybe the turbo version would be a GLI competitor, but now having driven a lesser version, there is no way it can hold a candle to the VW except in straight-line acceleration. The only thing it has going for it is the tech."

1425	July 29, 2019 4:06PM	nyccarguy	"Got back from our trip north of the border on Saturday. From what we saw in the Province of Ontario, Canada is a beautiful country. The roads are in fantastic shape and the drivers are disciplined & courteous.

Niagra falls is just beautiful. We stayed in a falls view room at The Sheraton. I never pay extra to book a room with a view, because we don’t spend time hanging out at the hotel. This was completely worth it. Lots of Tourist Traps, but we used Trip Advisor and found some very good restaurants. We took the Hornblower boat (Canadian Maid of The Mist) which was fantastic.

We took an afternoon and drove out to Niagra on The Lake which. There are so many beautiful wineries. It is what I imagine Nappa is like. Since we drove & had the kiddos in tow, we didn’t take full advantage of what the town has to offer but still had fun. Looks like an amazing place to have a weekend with just my wife. We bought some delicious ice wine and incredible craft cider."
1426	July 29, 2019 4:08PM	suydam	Not just the tech. I have friends who have driven them for 12+ years without a hitch. Reliability is key for a whole lotta people. For me I thought it was too noisy.

1428	July 29, 2019 4:11PM	graphicguy	"Because of UBER and Lyft, I don't rent nearly as many cars as I used to. I think I had an Altima rental about 4 months ago. And, I 2nd everything you said @qbrozen.

Matter of fact, between the recent Altima and the Sentras I've rented, it's no wonder Nissan is dramatically losing ground. Even their premium sedan (Maxima) elicits yawns. The 370ZX hasn't been updated in so long, I almost forgot they still make them. Trucks? Do the still make one? SUVs? Pathfinder? When was the last time that thing was competitive?

Traveling....I'm still flying ~100K miles/year. Trying to frame an exit strategy in the next couple of years, though."
1429	July 29, 2019 4:15PM	qbrozen	oh I think i goofed above. Its the Sentra you can get as a turbo now, right? well, I'm sure it isn't any improvement over the Altima.
1430	July 29, 2019 4:17PM	kyfdx	Altima has a turbo version, as well
1431	July 29, 2019 4:31PM	pensfan83	Most of my travel is short hops and usually on the east coast. It's dipped in the last year so I'll probably be a tier lower with AA. I can access Priority Pass lounges with one of my credit cards so as long as I have that benefit I'm happy.

Anyhoo, they have already disassembled, assessed the damage, and reported an estimate to Geico. First off, when I was there chatting with him, he said they would repair the quarter panel. I asked how that is even possible and he said they have these crazy machines these days that pretty much do it all. In his words, ""body repairs are far easier these days."" hmmm... He is also refurbing one wheel for a small scuff he noted, and then performing an alignment to make sure its all in spec. Replacing bumper, the bumper support, and all associated hardware.

SOOO... are y'all still sticking to the $10k guess?"
1441	July 29, 2019 7:23PM	pensfan83	"I wonder if they are going to repair yours in the same way mine was. They kept ""working"" the metal gouge back into place.

1442	July 29, 2019 7:30PM	qbrozen	My metal is actually torn, so I don't get it, really. I mean, they'll have to weld it and smooth it. No way a machine could do it all.

Best cars ever, as they were free to me (co. cars)! Marriott was primary choice, but with recession times, Holiday Inn and Ramada... Collected points for all, still have a few Marriott to spend!

Ended up buying the Dodge when I was suddenly (along with another sales rep) downsized, needed wheels quick and it was the enemy I knew. It was reliable, but poorly screwed together and a bit loud, yet nothing fell off or failed. But, once I was back on my feet, and as the miles built up, it was time to ""upgrade."" Because the Intrepid experience wasn't bad, I decided to purchase my first domestic car ever, a '99 Chrysler 300M. Similar to the Intrepid, handsome, reliable but not built to exact tolerances. And, large. As I approached 70k miles, I anticipated a tranny failure (as well as a strange noise coming from the front suspension) and traded for the '05 Acura TL.

1452	July 30, 2019 12:46AM	nyccarguy	"We got home late Saturday night. After unpacking the car, my wife realized she left her purse at the diner we ate at in Roscoe, NY for dinner (about 2 hours from our house). I called the diner and they had her purse. I got up Sunday and left at about 5:45 am to go get it. I got used to driving the Pilot over the last 1100 miles or so. I thought Maybe I should take it and set the adaptive cruise just to have an easy ride. What if my wife wanted to go somewhere with the kids before I got back? I hopped in the Infiniti and fired it up. I did the round trip to Roscoe in 3 hrs 45 minutes. I really got to spend some time thinking about cars (what else).

While it’s not perfect, I really do enjoy driving the Q40. I shouldn’t go and lease a Tacoma just because it’s cheap. An Accord 2.0 would be nice, but wouldn’t give me the “kick in the pants” acceleration that I love so much about the Q40. A Q50 Signature seems like it would be a “cheap” lease, but even that (at say $400 per month) would still end up costing somewhere around $15K over the next 39 months.

I took the car in to the dealer for service. With 52,500 miles (going on my 7,500 mile synthetic OCI) it got fresh synthetic oil and a tire rotation. $84 all in. I dropped it off as we had errands to run in the area where the dealer is located.

They gave me the rundown after their “complimentary multi point inspection.” Most of it confirmed what I already knew.

Rear pads down to 3 mm. Need to be replaced & rotors need to be resurfaced: $410.95 plus tax

Front pads still holding steady at 5 mm.

Front tires (now on the back I think) down to 5/32”. Rear tires (now on the front I think) down to 4/32”. $682.95 plus tax for (4) of the Hankook Ventus Noble S1 tires mounted & balanced. They said the tires should be ok until my next service. At that point, I’ll probably be ready to have the snow shoes mounted.

Getting close to “the point” where I decide to keep the car for the long haul or dump it for a lease and cash out with the equity I have in it.

I only owe about $5400 on it. My payments are $612.27/month. The rear pads/rotor resurfacing and the tires equate to about 2 months worth of payments."
1453	July 30, 2019 1:30AM	qbrozen	"Well, I waited long enough...

Here goes...

$3016.

Yup, believe it or not. Less than $1k in parts, and 40.5 hrs labor at $49/hr."
1454	July 30, 2019 1:54AM	tjc78	Wow, so much less than I thought
1455	July 30, 2019 1:55AM	sda	Incredible. I had a light scrape down the side of the Pilot that could have been ignored and it cost close to that amount to repair. It was a parking lot hit and run. The only part replaced was the tail light that wasn’t cracked only scratched and not badly.
1456	July 30, 2019 1:56AM	andres3	I blasted an Altima rental a few years ago and stand by my negative review of it. Poor acceleration, and poor fuel economy trying to avoid poor acceleration unsuccessfully I might add.
1457	July 30, 2019 2:12AM	xwesx	Shocking. I think optimistic, too, if they are truly putting it right. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that the smoothness of this experience will give way to a little turbulence, and you'll come in closer to $6K than $3K.
1458	July 30, 2019 2:20AM	andres3	"So the ancient 2015 Audi A4 quattro 2.0T was diagnosed at my favorite Audi dealer this morning:
1) Recommend new tires first and foremost. Current tires are dry-rotted; not passing CPO muster. Someone missed point 1 in the 300 point CPO inspection at Fletcher Jones Audi. I saw the cracking/weathering on the outside shoulder, but didn't look closely to see how bad it might be. Fletcher Jones needs to pay for new tires.

2) Recommend a recharge and dye test on the AC system. If the dye test reveals a leak, that's covered by CPO warranty. However, Fletcher Jones needs to pay for the recharge.
Called the sales manager at Fletcher Jones Audi to let him know the problems, and he still stuck to his story that I'd be well taken care of, not a problem; no issue.

He just needs to communicate the promise to Audi Escondido as they'll want to be compensated directly!

In the meantime I have a loaner Q3, not my favorite Audi, not by a long shot.

Lastly, I'm starting to remember why I like hassle-free problem-free new cars. Used cars just have too many variables, and you can't catch them all. It seems only the factories can do good quality control; haven't seen that from any used car dealers in the USA yet."
1459	July 30, 2019 2:42AM	qbrozen	We’ll see, but this place is literally a body shop, geico office, and enterprise office all under one roof. Quite an interesting operation. I’d imagine they’ve got this process dialed in.
1460	July 30, 2019 2:44AM	qbrozen	Oh! You know what is funny, though? I asked about a little dime-sized parking lot ding on my driver’s door that has been bugging me. He said that would be $500-$600 to put right. WHA??!
1461	July 30, 2019 6:30AM	marcogallo1986	Saw the review on the new 2020 outback, sad news everyone, they got rid of the six cylinder engine no more, just a turbo 2.4 with similar horsepower and torque, and better fuel economy supposedly, and a standard 2.5 engine also that I have.
1462	July 30, 2019 6:36AM	marcogallo1986	@QB not bad on the amount to fix it a lot less than we all thought in here.
1463	July 30, 2019 6:36AM	marcogallo1986	@ in your car guy, glad you had a nice vacation, time to dump the infinity soon ha ha, but would you lease to replace it? A lot to think about.
1464	July 30, 2019 12:59PM	marcogallo1986	@28FF good thing you lease your power pack when you did you didn’t get the 2020 model year coming out soon.
1465	July 30, 2019 1:24PM	au1994	Thats an incredible price to fix even after the inevitable add ons they will need.
1466	July 30, 2019 1:36PM	corvette	"That’s a lot cheaper than I expected, and I don’t know how the body shop can be profitable at that price.

A new bumper alone on my Infiniti was over $1,000."
1467	July 30, 2019 2:00PM	nyccarguy	I paid $1,500 for a new OEM Infiniti Bumper, paint, & installation. That rogue sport I hit at less than 5mph cost over $3K to fix.
1468	July 30, 2019 2:10PM	corvette	"My neighbor just got a new RAV4 Hybrid (or maybe it’s a RAV2, as I didn’t see a pumpkin on the rear axle). The warning sound it makes in reverse when the engine isn’t running sounds like a squealing fan belt, lol.

Edit: looks like all RAV4 Hybrids have AWD."
1469	July 30, 2019 2:27PM	28firefighter	We purposely jumped on the previous generation Outback (the 2019) because of how the discounts on them ahead of the 2020. I also wanted the H6 engine because I'd like to see another year or so of the 2.4 Turbo before I jump on it.
1470	July 30, 2019 2:34PM	jmonroe1	"WOW, that is an incredibly low price. Are you sure that isn't a typo; like there should be a 1 before the 3. Maybe even a zero after it. If that is truly the correct price, you should make sure they are spraying on factory spec paint and not lathering on water color with a brush.

Man, was I ever wrong.

jmonroe"
1471	July 30, 2019 2:35PM	nyccarguy	Smart move. Old “tech” is tried & true. Part of the reason I bought my Infiniti. It’s a 2015. The car has basically been in production as the G35/G37 since what 2006? 2007?
1472	July 30, 2019 2:55PM	marcogallo1986	@28ff I know those discounts you couldn’t pass up they were awesome, it’s a lease if I’m remembering correctly right, so three years you turn it in and then see what’s what I don’t have to really fix anything which is the plus the leasing, just as long as you stay under or around the miles you’re supposed to put on it totally in the three years. I’m bored during Ha ha ha that a lot of you in here, if I like something I’d buy it even if it’s the first year take my chances ha ha I guess it’s good I don’t drive ha ha
1473	July 30, 2019 2:56PM	marcogallo1986	@ New York car guy, yes that was around since 2007 Your Dr. train and car. When you get the chance to start doing some test drives give us some entertainment in here, and let us know eventually we are looking at replacing affinity with.
1474	July 30, 2019 5:20PM	xwesx	"Agreed on the Q3. I had one of those for a week (and 1,200 miles) when my Q7 was having its emissions modifications done. Worse fuel economy, a third the size, and about the same performance (from what I could tell). Part of that was probably the all-season tires in subarctic January, and the rest was just a meh vehicle.

As for used cars.... they always have some sorting to do up front. You went the right route on this, and you are likely to incur little cost in the sorting. Just bear with it and keep in mind the motivation for going this route.

Oh and thanks for the laugh.... Ancient. Hah!"
1475	July 30, 2019 5:22PM	xwesx	Possibly! I have yet to get out of a body shop for anything closely resembling the initial estimate. If they have it dialed in on first go, then I'm envious of your good fortune.
1476	July 30, 2019 5:27PM	xwesx	"It's a smart move for them. The H6 is too low in volume to warrant a modernization that will eek out better fuel economy. The fact that they did not adopt it in the Ascent put the writing on the wall, for me; as soon as they announced the 2.4 turbo in that vehicle as the one and only engine, it was clear that this was their path forward. And, given the substantial update and warm welcome of that model, it only makes sense for them to move ahead with it.

Subaru has long been about efficiency and scalability in their manufacturing."
1477	July 30, 2019 7:37PM	nyccarguy	I still cannot post pictures here from my iPhone.
1478	July 30, 2019 8:26PM	corvette	@qbrozen I wonder whether their repair cost estimates cut out some of the profit margin that a non-affiliated shop would have. Regardless, they should have access to the latest repair technology.
1479	July 30, 2019 9:57PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest agreed. I had a feeling they wouldn’t upgrade the 3.6 V6 with modern technology myself, and yes when I put that engine in the sent the 2.4 turbo, I figured that would be the way forward to as well with all other Subaru models in the future. The way of the future it is what it is.

As to the CPO Audi, I think your right, and this is exactly why I went CPO. Free loaners and have things taken care of (that should have already been taken care of). It sounds like the work was authorized and Fletcher Jones Audi from up North is doing right by me!

I told them don't buy the Pirelli P7's as a replacement tire. The fact they were dry rotted is just another bad review for an OEM tire known for bad reviews. I suggested Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3+'s, like my Alltrack had (which by the way, those wheels and tires from the Alltrack in my garage should fit the A4... but I don't know about reducing handling by going from 245/40R18 to 225/50R17, but diameter wise, a very close match.

Giving what amounts to a couple free oil changes and tire rotations is pretty skimpy in exchange for reducing the B2B warranty by two years."

1486	August 1, 2019 2:05AM	thebean	VW hasn’t even had the 6 yr warranty in effect long enough to see what the year 5 & 6 costs were going to be. I think this is going to hurt their sales. The extended warranty was supposed to gain back some of the trust lost by the diesel fiasco. Short term thinking.
1487	August 1, 2019 2:14AM	xwesx	"True, but a B2B for six years?! There's a ton of wear-and-tear stuff (particularly internal components) that can break during that time-frame, at no fault of the manufacturing, that would be at the cost of the manufacturer, and it is just too much liability for them. I don't think it plays heavily with buyer decision (particularly given that most new-car buyers don't keep them beyond five years). Frankly, even at the revised numbers it is still a generous bumper-to-bumper warranty.

This change is more value to the (new car) consumer and less risk to the company."
1488	August 1, 2019 3:07AM	corvette	They can extrapolate the historical 5 and 6 year costs from parts orders and other data. I agree that a lot of new car buyers aren’t going to see it as a selling point.
1489	August 1, 2019 3:13AM	28firefighter	"I spoke with my sales guy at VW about the warranty when I drove the GLI. He said it was absolutely killing dealer revenue on the backend because it was cannibalizing extended warranty sales.

Low conversion rate for sales combined with an annoyed channel is not a recipe for success."
1490	August 1, 2019 3:45AM	nyccarguy	"That Virtual Cockpit will go kaput literally at 12:01 am when the warranty runs out or at 72,001 miles (whichever comes 1st).

A lot of dealers seem to be making money by tailoring extended warranties to leases. My best friend just leased his wife a Grand Cherokee High Atitude. 36 months/15K miles per year. Dealer offered him an extension of the Jeep 3 year/36K warranty to run to 45K miles for around $300. He took it."
1491	August 1, 2019 3:52AM	cdnpinhead	"Well, think about it. How many of you guys buy vehicles vs. leasing? One is an entirely different business model to the other.

Possessing a vehicle and treating it as an art object leads one in an entirely different direction from actually driving the thing to go places over a long period of time."

For $300 I would have too."
1493	August 1, 2019 12:44PM	stickguy	Maybe not BtoB, but plenty of makers offer powertrain out to 5-6 years, so most of the likely expensive stuff is covered anyway.
1494	August 1, 2019 12:49PM	28firefighter	IIRC VW always had a 5/60 powertrain. Assuming that’s not changing I can see why folks didn’t really see this as a selling point alone.
1495	August 1, 2019 12:58PM	ab348	I guess @Sandman6472 just missed out on this when he bought his Golf? Otherwise the $600 door lock repair would have been warranty.
1496	August 1, 2019 3:17PM	ronsteve	"Nissan CVT wasn't bad in the Murano either. I just didn't consider it much further because the current generation is fugly.

My '15 RDX is a NA V6 and it's got nice acceleration but being a Honda sometimes I wish there was a little more grunt around 2000 rpm, for things like getting up long Interstate hills or trying to change lanes into a small gap. Finding myself a bit liberal with the paddles at times, and still judging it against the 2.5T in my old Volvo. I think the next move, whenever that happens, might be back to low-boost DI turbo for good. Though these automatics with too many gears might be even more shift-happy."
1497	August 1, 2019 3:32PM	rrsafety	I've been driving a 1999 Lexus LS400 for about a decade now. It is getting on in miles (about 240,000) but I really hate to give it up. However, if I found the right used car that could give me the same feel as my LS400, I might switch. Any suggestions in the $20k range for a five year old car that will make me forget about my LS?
1498	August 1, 2019 3:48PM	marcogallo1986	Man your best friend got a deal on the extended warranty that they gave him on the lease, they did that with us back in 2014 with one of the rugs we had forget how much they charge for the warrantee wasn’t that much either. But can’t hurt hurt to have it for the cheaper price if they charged over $1000 probably would say no when your dad know.
1499	August 1, 2019 3:50PM	marcogallo1986	Glad you’re enjoying your Maxima rental, one of my mom had that she least I thought it drove good with the CBT, I think the six-cylinder and CBT pairing that Nissan does is always been good. Even in the first generation Marano to that my sister-in-law had. It’s the four-cylinder ones but they could do a better job, which I think they’re finally starting to do, the new Ultima my friend has drives well. My brother is 2013 isn’t bad either, I can’t stand the way it’s set up though in my moms 2018 rogue horrible under powered annoying. They put shift points to make it sort of like a regular automatic but could be sorted out better, Hunter seems to good job with their CBT‘s though in everything. I’ve only been in accord prior generation, and current well prior generation C RV seem to be OK.

1501	August 1, 2019 5:43PM	xwesx	True, which is why I'm saying that the revised VW B2B is still generous. The point of B2B is to deal with manufacturing defects (and give buyers peace of mind). At 4, 5, 6 years out... are you really likely to deal with manufacturing defects at that point? Perhaps in the drivetrain, but other stuff is far more likely to be a result of use.
1502	August 1, 2019 5:45PM	xwesx	Yeah, they didn't bump that warranty up until MY17, if I recall correctly. It may have even been MY18. It was during/after the diesel scandal and settlement, which didn't even break until September of 2015.

Pretty sure it started with the SUVs in 17 and expanded to the rest of the line in 18."
1504	August 1, 2019 6:19PM	benjaminh	"Imho nothing is going to give you the feel of a Lexus LS400 but another LS. Maybe you could find a somewhat newer one with lower miles? Here's a 2004 LS430 with only 40k miles for c.$15k:

https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/779020856/overview/

But if you love your current car and there's nothing significant wrong with it why not keep it? A Lexus is built to last, and maybe it has 300k miles in it? Another used car to consider might be a used Acura RLX, which is about the same size as an LS400.

If you'd consider leasing or buying a new car, the Avalon is like the Lexus of Toyotas. The front styling is weird, but there are big incentives on the Avalon that make buying or leasing it pretty attractive. I test drove an Avalon before getting my Acura and I liked it. And, although it's smaller than the LS 400, the Acura TLX V-6 has some great lease incentives and has performance and handling that might be somewhat similar to an LS400."

1506	August 1, 2019 11:04PM	Sandman6472	Yes, the longer warranty wouldn’t cover my 2015 Golf since that program started after I already owned it. Shame but such is life I guess.

The significant other likes the punch of the 2.0T, the transmission, the drive, the ride, the extra size and ride height. The SEL lacks Fender Audio but has just about everything else a person could want.

She loves the new ICE SILVER color (think a very light Nardo Gray), with the Slate Blue (State Blue?) running in 2nd place. She likes the lighter gray colored interior seats and leatherette as opposed to all black on black on black. She says she'd like AWD, but I'm not sure it'll get used much by her, but certainly I wouldn't hesitate to turn the Tiguan into an off-roader with 4-Motion. The R-Lines have 19"" wheels, too big.

I detailed up the RDX today (always needs it after a week at the beach) and it shined up nice, and even cleaned the filthy wheels so they are shiny. but she noticed the assortment of scratches are still there, and I noticed when cleaning the seats that the bolsters are showing some wear spot. So, runs strong, miles still reasonable, but definitely not new any more!

not in the budget yet though. So, she can just live with it for commuting duties, and will continue to use the TLX when together. I was chatting with her earlier about the TLX and maybe keeping it and trading hers in, but I don't think we are likely to do that (and definitely don't want 2 payments)."

I think that is our only dry spell since I was married in 1993.

But, the payment on my wife's car is only because they offered 0%/72 month financing, with no bonus for not taking it.. Otherwise I would have paid cash."
1534	August 3, 2019 8:26PM	stickguy	really need to get off the leasing train if want to ever be payment free. Wifes next car will be a purchase, but I doubt we are paying cash. Probably a chunk down and a short term loan (3 years max, pay it off in 2, something like that). then keep it until 10 years old!
1535	August 3, 2019 8:27PM	28firefighter	I don’t see a reason to leave the lease train unless I can’t get what i want. I’d rather have fixed costs and depreciation on a depreciating asset.
1536	August 3, 2019 8:29PM	stickguy	"sat in a new GLI today at the dealer. 35th anniversary addition. White, with a stick. Nice car. Really liked the seats too. Plenty of cushion tilt and thigh support, even with manual seats. Pretty similar overall to the kids R Line (but I am sure a whole lot quicker).

We were at dealer having her new NJ plates put on (since she relocated back from Deleaware). Did the DMV stuff today, got new plates, and it needed a front bracket so just took it over to dealer to do. Common activity for them..

while there, also saw a new Aereton (sp?) Really nice inside, and impressive style. But it better be nice for $45k+"
1537	August 3, 2019 8:31PM	ab348	Yeah, my problem isn't the money, really, as much as that I like driving something new and different every so often. Even though the current ATS is a purchase (also with 0% financing), all other things being equal I can see myself getting something different in a couple of years.
1538	August 3, 2019 8:33PM	ab348	"Maybe @breld wants to dip his toe into the Civic Type R pool again.

Though given the price, perhaps not.

1539	August 3, 2019 8:52PM	xwesx	Looks like a dreamer to me.
1540	August 3, 2019 8:59PM	28firefighter	Bought a set of OEM Viggen Wheels finished in Satin Black sitting on nearly new Cooper Zeon tires. Too good a deal to pass up given that mine are curbed and bent to high heaven. And yes they all fit in the hatch without so much as a struggle.
1541	August 3, 2019 8:59PM	sda	I just wish the GLI 35th had a sunroof like the R Line.
1542	August 3, 2019 9:01PM	28firefighter	I wish we got the Canadian version of the 35th Anniversary edition. Which is an autobahn with Nav, DCC, and the 35th trim and design bits.
1543	August 3, 2019 9:05PM	stickguy	at least with 2 cars (at least!) in the family, more chance to rotate variety. though my plan is when my car goes back, buy the wife whatever she wants to drive the next 10 years,then when I recover from the shock of doing that, find myself some kind of toy to go along with the RDX.
1544	August 3, 2019 9:16PM	sda	I think the Accord will go to my daughter when the TL has done its duty. I will get something for me, which will probably be another sedan, Accord, TLX, Mazda 6.
1545	August 3, 2019 9:16PM	benjaminh	"++++

But since this is CCBA, I'll try to make a pitch that I'm 99.99% sure is going to fail....

A 2013 Accord EX in good shape might be worth c.$12k on a trade-in? If so, 3k might be used to start a lease on a 2019 Acura TLX, and then you could put 9k or so into savings. Imho you'd enjoy the 4-wheel steering, the added power, the quieter ride, the handling, adaptive cruise control, AndroidAuto/CarPlay, and esp. the ELS sound system. Because of the incredible $9k in lease incentives on this model monthly payments might be close c.$300 or so? And the mpg can be pretty good in a TLX as illustrated by this rare but possible 30+ mile trip mostly on the Interstate at c.70 mph with the AC on where my TLX got 40 mpg.

OK. Now that I've failed, you can go back to the virtuous good life with your Accord—which will probably last another 15 years!+++"
1546	August 3, 2019 9:22PM	28firefighter	Leases on the TLX are not at $300 without significant cap reduction. The $9k in incentives is hurt by a seriously bad residual and high money factor.
1547	August 3, 2019 9:31PM	benjaminh	"You are right.

But this base model 2019 TLX has an advertised lease at my local Acura dealer of less than $300 month with $2k down, but it is a weird low-mileage lease with 7500 a year, and so a more reasonable 10-12k would cost more. But most Acura dealers probably are willing to do almost whatever it takes to get you into one, including giving a good value on a trade-in. The low residual is a benefit imho, since I'm hoping to be able to buy my car which had a c. $38k msrp for c.$18.5k when my lease is up.

1548	August 3, 2019 11:10PM	28firefighter	"That’s a net 0 down (but not including drive offs) and $294+tax. Likely you’d have $1000 to $1500 in driveoffs depending on location.

TLX Tech (4 cyl) is leasing in the mid 300s assuming a 10% discount before rebates. V6 Tech/A-Spec and AWD in the 400s. Still a great car.

To me, the bargain would be if you could immediately buy out the lease and have them not charge you for the interest on remaining payments. Then you could take advantage of the lease cash and purchase with a lower interest rate."
1549	August 3, 2019 11:40PM	stickguy	"IMO you don't want the base TLX. Need to go at least to tech (the A spec is just a tech with the ""sporty"" extras added on).

Mine was early in the model year, so I imagine the incentives are better now, but off an MSRP of ~40k, my cap cost was ~33k. I think the residual was an even 50%, so my buy-out option is right around $20k.

no clue what it would cost me to buy now (or what it would have been 1-2 months in). I don't plan to ask! at the end, I will decide if I want to buy it out, but I suspect, if I stick to my usual low miles, it could be a good buy at 3 YO with barely over 20,000 miles, and (hopefully) in impeccable condition! Just depends on if that is the car I want to commit to living with for the next decade!"
1550	August 3, 2019 11:44PM	stickguy	ran the plan past the wife at dinner. In 2 years and a few months, we go shopping and look at every near or luxury compact to mid-sized CUV. Lots of test drives, and she can pick out whatever she wants to drive, and keep another 10 years. I will just keep the RDX, and then go shopping for a fun/toy car of some kind to go with it, and use in nice weather. Just not sure we will be able to get in and out of anything too fun (low) at that point!
1551	August 4, 2019 12:00AM	suydam	Can she frame that statement “she can pick out whatever she wants” and show it to you in two years?
1552	August 4, 2019 12:36AM	corvette	Which model of Zeon? Could be the same I have on my G37.
1553	August 4, 2019 1:33AM	nyccarguy	Are you happy with those? I’m definitely going to need a set. My Hankook Ventus S1 Nobles are quickly turning into racing slicks.
1554	August 4, 2019 1:37AM	28firefighter	Cooper Zeon RS3-a I think.
1555	August 4, 2019 2:39AM	roadburner	I ran those year round on my X3 and as winter tires on the MS3. I was very happy with them.
1556	August 4, 2019 2:50AM	stickguy	"well, she could get one now. but doesn't want to spend the money/take on the payment. Plus, doesn't want to get rid of the RDX which that would require.

maybe next year when we finish paying off the last of the college related expenses, all the money going toward that will burn a hole in her pocket!

but pretty sure, unless something goes wrong (she has zero tolerance now for a car stranding her) we will stay the course."
1557	August 4, 2019 2:51AM	stickguy	I have Cooper's on my RDX. Really good tires so far.
1558	August 4, 2019 3:01AM	corvette	Mine are the RS3-G1. Don’t seem to be rated well for winter traction, but I don’t plan to drive it in the snow if I can avoid it. I’m happy with them so far.
1559	August 4, 2019 5:03AM	Michaell	"Coopers on the Outback, as well. Just sent up an appt to have them rotated next week.

Will set up the 30k service, as well."
1560	August 4, 2019 5:38AM	ronsteve	Isn't the need for new tires usually a cue for a CCB to get another car?
1561	August 4, 2019 11:21AM	ab348	I read somewhere that Cooper tires are manufactured using an older (i.e. less good) sort of process? That was in the context of the Cooper Cobra white-letter retro muscle care tires so maybe it just applies to them.
1562	August 4, 2019 12:46PM	corvette	I’m not sure about the manufacturing process. They certainly don’t have the prestige of Michelin or Continental, but Cooper is their premier brand (they also own Mastercraft, Starfire, and some others, and I think they used to make Big O’s house brand tires, but I’m not sure whether this is still true). Cooper’s higher end tires have a visual tread wear square in the tread, which is helpful for people who don’t have a tread depth gauge.
1563	August 4, 2019 1:18PM	sda	If by chance you do start looking for a car for your wife, you may want to confirm the infotainment system in the RDX works to your satisfaction. My SIL continues to have issues. It is often unresponsive, will drop audio, calls, sometimes just go black. This is a total frustration for her as she actually uses the many functions of the system. She has worked with the dealer, Acura customer service and has submitted a written complaint. The standard response is they are working on an update but no eta. Otherwise she really like the RDX, but this has really given her buyers remorse.
1564	August 4, 2019 1:32PM	tjc78	I’ve never had Cooper, but did have Mastercraft years ago and they wore like iron and were good in all conditions.
1565	August 4, 2019 1:39PM	qbrozen	"oh man. Not a good time for this to come up. This is exactly like the one my dad had.
https://bringatrailer.com/listing/1984-mazda-rx-7-gsl-se-12/"
1566	August 4, 2019 2:41PM	nyccarguy	Why don’t you sell the RDX to Carvana or Carnax and use the proceeds from the sale to fund most of a lease for the next 2-3 years?
1567	August 4, 2019 5:06PM	xwesx	Excellent! Plan 1 of 10,000 to come over the next 2 years (and a few months)....
1568	August 4, 2019 5:42PM	breld	"I do think fondly of the Type R now and again - what a great drive.

But I don't think I want to deal with the attention it gathers.

And yes, that seller is dreaming."
1569	August 4, 2019 5:48PM	breld	"Well, gotta tell you all, this may be a ""no-punch"" year for the @breld clan.

Here we are in August, and all our attention and, more significantly, funds, are directed at the new house. And, I regret to say, we are still the unwitting owners of two houses. We seem to be getting more traction on the sale of our former house, but alas, it is still ours.

So...our car budget this year is all taken up by things like this..."
1570	August 4, 2019 7:04PM	stickguy	ambitious project!
1571	August 4, 2019 7:07PM	stickguy	"well, if the desire was to unload her car and get a new one, there are many ways to make that happen. But if we got a lease, that means in 3 years (well, 2.5, then 6 months later) we would be carless again. And the plan is to keep the RDX around indefinitely, so trading it doesn't work. When the new one finally arrives it will replace the TLX, and the RDX goes into spare car duty.

could work out nicely if Acura 2 years from now is running killer end of summer deals and will do a lease pull-ahead. Getting out early is always a viable option."
1572	August 4, 2019 7:08PM	stickguy	as to the infotainment, that sucks to be having problems with it. Hopefully it gets resolved. I wonder how wide spread it is? Not a worry to me, since they would have a few years to debug the system (and it would have gone through it's mid model refresh) before we come along to buy!
1573	August 4, 2019 7:35PM	benjaminh	I must have missed something. Did you own an Acura RDX? But you had a Pilot and then traded that in on the Q5....
1574	August 4, 2019 7:52PM	breld	Well, we have a landscaper doing all the work. So ambitious from a pocketbook standpoint primarily!
1575	August 4, 2019 7:55PM	kyfdx	Haven’t seen one of these in awhile
1576	August 4, 2019 7:56PM	kyfdx	Supposedly, owner sold this to someone, today.
1577	August 4, 2019 9:24PM	sda	The Q5 replaced our 2010 Pilot. My SIL replaced her 2006 TL w/nav that she bought new with a 2019 RDX Advance in February and generously gave the TL to us for our daughter to drive. It was meticulously maintained and looks and drives beautifully. Hard to believe it is 13 years old with 156k.
1578	August 4, 2019 9:31PM	ab348	A Lotus is like a sailboat. Happiest days of your life are the day you buy it, and the day you sell it.

1580	August 5, 2019 1:15AM	stickguy	sharp looking car. though just to my eye, they look +1 too big for the vintage of it.
1581	August 5, 2019 1:20AM	28firefighter	The tires are slightly tall (215/50 instead of 215/45). Wheels are OEM 17s, but finished in satin black.
1582	August 5, 2019 1:21AM	sda	Looks sharp, and really compliments the color of the car.
1583	August 5, 2019 1:22AM	nyccarguy	How’d you post a picture?
1584	August 5, 2019 1:22AM	28firefighter	It’s been fixed for me for a few weeks. I just request desktop mode in safari.
1585	August 5, 2019 1:37AM	pensfan83	They look great, nice contrast with the car.
1586	August 5, 2019 1:46AM	corvette	"Any significant difference on the speedometer? I went with a plus-zero size with slightly more revolutions per mile on the G37. With the factory size, the speedometer read 2-3 MPH faster than you were actually going, now it seems to be more accurate.

I think the wheels look great."
1587	August 5, 2019 1:53AM	stickguy	"speaking of a G37, my neighbor that has one seems to be upgrading to a new Infiniti. Today a Q50 with temp tags appeared in his driveway. Though his G is there also. Not sure if he is keeping it, but certainly didn't trade it in. I think it is maybe a 2012? Probably a ton of miles because he has a long commute.

Could have gotten rid of his wife's RX350 (probably about 8-10 YO I would guess, though likely lower miles) because I did not see that today, but that would surprise me.

Definitely likes Infinitis, because a year or so ago he traded in his gen 1 Nissan 350Z for a Q60 (both were sticks, those stay in the garage most of the time)."
1588	August 5, 2019 2:23AM	28firefighter	I’ll be going at most 2 mph faster than the speedometer will read. Based on a GPS I use, it will actually make the speedometer more accurate.

1598	August 5, 2019 6:59PM	breld	@tifighter - beautiful shot! And I too like the red. I'm starting to warm up to the darker shades of red and could even see myself going that way sometime, just for something different.
1599	August 5, 2019 7:49PM	breld	"Okay, so just as I open my mouth and say no more punches, I do a little search for GTIs.

This I could really get into...

Specifically, I like this Iron Blue (the name is something like that), but more significantly, I'm not sure I've ever seen an SE trim with the plaid seats. I know that was made an option for the SE model at some point, but I've never actually seen one."
1600	August 5, 2019 7:55PM	benjaminh	The GTI looks really good to me. Nice price for the condition and miles. Plus it still has c. 4 years of warranty?
1601	August 5, 2019 8:02PM	28firefighter	I believe if you get the SE with plaid seats (and it is rare) you do not get the fender audio with it.
1602	August 5, 2019 8:06PM	breld	"Interesting - not a deal killer, but disappointing.

EDIT - Carvana provides the original window sticker, so based off that, you're right...no Fender audio. But some nice safety tech on it, like Blind Spot, Rear Cross Traffic and autonomous emergency braking."
1603	August 5, 2019 8:06PM	kyfdx	You know, I could've bought a 2017 GTI Sport with just 4000 miles for under $22K... and, that was two years ago!!
1604	August 5, 2019 8:12PM	28firefighter	Look, I can understand the desire to go back to GTI. It just does a lot of things really well in it's class.
1605	August 5, 2019 8:23PM	breld	Snooze you lose.
1606	August 5, 2019 8:26PM	kyfdx	@breld I must have... constantly reminded, every time I see a GTI (that's a lot!)
1607	August 5, 2019 8:33PM	xwesx	Autonomous Emergency Braking. That's a GREAT idea for a car with a manual transmission! Hahahha
1608	August 5, 2019 8:36PM	breld	"Yes it does. Can't really match the level of refinement without getting into the luxury class, I'd say. And the GTI has a very broad appeal, from younger folks who tend to run mods, to a more mature audience who appreciate the balance of the car. As much as I like Hondas, I just haven't been able to pull the trigger on an Si - a bit too boy racy for me, without the performance to back it up (like a Type R).

Anyway - just updated my quote from Carvana on the Miata - so with a click of the mouse and $647, I could go from my 2017 Miata RF to this 2018 GTI SE.

I'm kinda buzzing right now, but we'll see. I'd give it a 50/50 shot at this point."
1609	August 5, 2019 8:41PM	28firefighter	It’s a compelling choice especially with the long warranty and stalling issues plaguing 2019 MY cars.
1610	August 5, 2019 8:49PM	mjfloyd1	"@breld - didn’t you just post about a “no punch” year?...

1612	August 5, 2019 9:08PM	tifighter	After a ton of grey cars, I was ready for more color. The red on the X, and the blue on the 3 are a fun combo.
1613	August 5, 2019 9:13PM	tifighter	"I know this sounds anti-CCBA, but...
Your practical needs are already handled by the Q7. So for the role of fun car, what does the GTI give you over the Miata?"
1614	August 5, 2019 9:15PM	Michaell	4 doors and a back seat, making it infinitely more practical with two teenagers.
1615	August 5, 2019 9:17PM	breld	"Fair point for sure.

It would allow me to enjoy the ""fun"" car more often instead of relying on the Q7 every time I need a backseat."
1616	August 5, 2019 9:18PM	laurasdada	"How about this red?
None more red..."
1617	August 5, 2019 9:26PM	tifighter	I know about the practical stuff. But we're talking fun car. @breld you might need a Cayman. Teens don't want to hang with Dad anyhow...
1618	August 5, 2019 9:28PM	28firefighter	The backseat is tight on the GTI - I'm not sure any teenager is going to want to sit back there. I'm all for enabling, but perhaps a GLI 35th Anniversary 6speed for the $23,5 I've seen advertised would do the trick?
1619	August 5, 2019 9:34PM	breld	It's not as tight as the Miata.
1620	August 5, 2019 9:34PM	pensfan83	They're discounting them that much already?
1621	August 5, 2019 9:37PM	28firefighter	"$4500 off in my part of the world. 6spd 35th Anniversary is $27,8. I'd get an additional $500 off via VW Partner program.

Lot of car for the money."
1622	August 5, 2019 9:39PM	breld	I may stop at a VW dealership this evening to reacquaint myself with the GTI. I could always take a look at the GLI as well.
1623	August 5, 2019 9:44PM	pensfan83	Dealers here aren't even close with their list prices. 35th Anni are discounted on average $2,600, Autobahns around $1,500.
1624	August 5, 2019 9:50PM	ab348	"I can't get that Carvana GTI listing to open any photos. I wonder if that is somehow related to the forum issues with Firefox here.

ETA: Opened Chrome, it can't open any photos there either, so forget that theory. Also noted that the GTI is now shown as sale pending."
1625	August 5, 2019 9:50PM	Michaell	I'll go on the record and state that @breld will prefer the GTI to the GLI.
1626	August 5, 2019 9:53PM	benjaminh	The backseat of the GTI is pretty good imho, esp. for a car of that size. Great headroom because of the rare these days squarish styling. And the legroom for the rear passengers of the GTI is good enough unless you have someone with really long legs. The GTI is a rare sports car that can hold four grown people with reasonable comfort.
1627	August 5, 2019 10:14PM	28firefighter	I’m showing this to my wife tonight. I’m lobbying hard for a GTI or WRX to replace the X1.
1628	August 5, 2019 10:22PM	breld	Unbelievable - that’s not pending due to me.
1629	August 5, 2019 10:38PM	tjc78	At the dealer ... details to follow
1630	August 5, 2019 10:40PM	pensfan83	The WRX is fun to drive and the handling is very tight and connected to the road, but it has a pretty stiff ride and road noise was pretty prevalent. It was also tight in the back with a car seat. The last time I drove one was in 2014 when shopping for the Fusion's replacement so YMMV.
1631	August 5, 2019 10:41PM	benjaminh	And, believe it or not, the GTI has almost as much cargo space with the seats down as a BMW X1 with the seats down.
1632	August 5, 2019 11:01PM	28firefighter	Yeah. I remember the rear seat mostly being rough for the front seat passenger with the infant seat and rear facing convertible in the GTI. I imagine it’s similar for the WRX but want to do my due diligence.

""Automakers Need to Start Worrying About the Batteries Lurking in Older EVs
By Matt Posky on August 5, 2019

....For many consumers, swapping an old battery pack with new one is prohibitively expensive. Replacing the comparatively small units found in a hybrid vehicle can cost anywhere between $2,000 to over $7,000. However, the worst you’ll have to endure on a hybrid up until that point is a slew of warning notifications stating your battery is dying until the car finally fails to start. In the interim, you might also notice a modest MPG reduction. But you’ll probably have to start worrying about other major repairs by the time that happens, perhaps propelling you into a new car.

Purely electric vehicles are different. Range will gradually become an issue, worsening every year until the car becomes unusable for anything other than a trip around the block. As if that weren’t enough, their larger batteries cost quite a bit more.

Automotive News highlighted this fact in an interview with an early adopter named Ravi Kan-ade. Since purchasing his 2012 Nissan Leaf SL, he’s watched its charging capacity diminish by half over 60,000 miles of driving. That’s not ideal, especially considering the car’s 24-kWh battery started out with an operational range of just 84 miles. He’s dying for the refurbishment option.

While Nissan said it was considering extending the program to North America when it launched in Japan last year, potentially opening the door for kWh upgrades, nothing has been confirmed. It might not even make sense for Nissan to expand the program in its current penny-pinching state. But it would instill a warm, safe feeling inside its customer base.

In Japan the Leaf battery refurbishment costs around $3,000 and units come via a new battery recycling plant inside the country. That’s not cheap, but it’s better than the alternative.

“A refurb program is needed to help owners who were affected by Gen 1 vehicles,” Kan-ade said. “I believe that these early battery failures are part of a learning curve that was passed on to the consumer. Nissan offered a battery replacement program for $5,500, but unfortunately they quietly raised the price to $8,500.”"
1634	August 5, 2019 11:32PM	qbrozen	I found the backseat of my GTI downright cavernous. Bigger than any midsize sedans I had up to that point.
1635	August 5, 2019 11:37PM	qbrozen	"Got the police report today. The nice officer wrote “driver one [the truck] at fault. Improper lane change and sideswiped driver two.” THANK YOU!

Then got a call late in the day that my car is ready. I will go first thing in the morn."
1636	August 5, 2019 11:49PM	sda	Good news on tagging fault on the truck driver. Absolutely amazing your car is repaired already! The Honda body shop had the Pilot over a week to do a minor body repair, not anything as serious as what you experienced.
1637	August 6, 2019 12:06AM	28firefighter	Good news, @qbrozen. Justice!
1638	August 6, 2019 12:10AM	tjc78	"So... back home now.

No punch to report as this was the first test drive.

The car: https://www.holmaninfiniti.com/inventory/new-2019-infiniti-q50-3-0t-luxe-awd-awd-sedan-jn1ev7ar2km552045

Not the color choices I’d made, but equipped how i want.

I have to say this is one posh dealer, but given the price point of the vehicles it should be. I was greeted quickly and hooked up with a pretty knowledgeable salesperson. He explained the different models (which i knew, but allowed the spiel).

My overall impressions were really good. I was very comfortable, ride was firm but not at all harsh. Steering was a little light until I put it in sport mode. That stiffened it up nicely.

The infotainment that everyone complains about was not bad at all. I liked the dual screens. The lack of Apple Car Play is concerning, but not a deal breaker if the car has built in navigation which this one does.

Didn’t talk much about numbers, but first pencil was $1600 OOP, $487 39/10K.

Since I wasn’t making a decision tonight (or probably even this month) I didn’t ask for anything further. Only thing I questioned was did they use the buy rate MF, and got a great answer “oh, that’s not my thing.... they do that on the computer”. LOL

Holding for now, need to get behind the wheel of an S60. If the Infiniti is what I want I’ll cast a wide net looking for quotes, but the broker deals on LH are pretty strong at 400 sign and drive."
1639	August 6, 2019 12:25AM	sda	Looks nice. It puzzles me that luxury name plates such as MB, BMW, Cadillac, Acura, Infiniti, Lincoln insist on making a faux leather vinyl based ‘leatherette’ as standard. I think Audi is the exception and offers a nice quality leather as standard across their line.
1640	August 6, 2019 12:38AM	benjaminh	"Imho ""leatherette"" in a base luxury model does maybe make some sense for three reasons. First, today's leatherette feels better than the stuff did c.30 years or so ago. Second, it saves on costs and allows a lower price for an entry-level model, so that someone who normally can't afford a luxury model might be able to make the leap. Third, it's maintenance free, and for the budget buyer that's a plus, as is the fact that it will last longer than the engine. At my local Acura dealer once in a while on their website they have c. 15 year old Acuras, and often the leather shows signs of wear or is even starting to split."
1641	August 6, 2019 12:44AM	benjaminh	"Good looking car! And huge amounts of power. How fast are those 0-60?

But that's strange for any car to not have CarPlay/AndroidAuto at this point. Even most economy cars have it. I have built in navi in my TLX, but I never use it, because the Google maps that come with AndroidAuto are so much better—and you can just say your destination and it does it right away without any fuss.

$487 a month does seem like a lot."
1642	August 6, 2019 12:55AM	breld	Corrected. Now it’s pending, to me. 😁
1643	August 6, 2019 12:56AM	corvette	That's good news. See whether you can make a diminished value claim against the trucking company--if not, it's a lease you're going to give back, so no skin off your back, but probably worth looking into because you're the legal owner during the lease.
1644	August 6, 2019 12:57AM	28firefighter	As always, @breld, we’re not worthy.
1645	August 6, 2019 1:00AM	Michaell	Congrats! This is what - your fourth GTI? Plus the Golf R?
1646	August 6, 2019 1:02AM	corvette	Say what?!? The first deal fell through and you were the backup?
1647	August 6, 2019 1:09AM	xwesx	"He said, ""may be;"" ""MAY BE"""
1648	August 6, 2019 1:11AM	xwesx	The depth of the luster on that paint is inspiring.
1649	August 6, 2019 1:12AM	xwesx	Want? Who said anything about that? They get what they get!
1650	August 6, 2019 1:14AM	xwesx	I found it to be tricky: The main page had some sort of overlay that said Carvana was not available in my area, and it disabled the use of the page (e.g., clicking on photos, etc). However, it did allow me to look at the vehicle details, and inside the vehicle details were photo thumbnails. Clicking on those worked, and I was able to scroll through them.
1651	August 6, 2019 1:30AM	stickguy	that is a really nice looking one. Exactly how I would want it too.
1652	August 6, 2019 1:42AM	stickguy	curious what happened to take it from pending to available that quick. and at just the right time!
1653	August 6, 2019 1:43AM	28firefighter	The website prompts you that many cars become available again after going pending. I bet there is a pretty high false start rate.
1654	August 6, 2019 1:45AM	stickguy	I never went the buy route when I was selling, but I think you are right. Easy to just hit reserve and start the process while thinking it over.
1655	August 6, 2019 2:05AM	stickguy	"T, can't wait to hear a report on the S60. I love the looks, seats, interior. But I have always had a fondness for Volvos (I know, not everyone's cup of tea). I have refrained from driving one yet.

at least when it is time for us to look, I can enjoy driving a V and XC60. And XC40 for the heck of it."
1656	August 6, 2019 2:07AM	nyccarguy	"@tjc78 - you’ve seen some of the magic deals on LH. If the Q50
Is what you like, then the broker might be the quickest, easiest, & cheapest route."
1657	August 6, 2019 2:14AM	stickguy	"I'm still unsure if I could go the broker route. But, if the deal was good enough, I could suck it up. Hey, I pushed the ""do it"" button on Honcker, and that was a total leap of faith!"
1658	August 6, 2019 2:45AM	breld	"Once @ab348 mentioned he couldn't pull up the listing, I checked for myself and had the same result. This was just before I took a new GTI out for a test drive to make sure I still liked it as much as before. Since I did indeed love it, and realized how much I wanted the SE trim but plaid seats, I was very disappointed.

But just before I left the dealership, I checked for the Carvana GTI again and it was available. So I completed the trade/purchase on my phone right there in the parking lot. In a way, having the listing temporarily unavailable highlighted how much I wanted it.

As you're going through the purchase steps, you are allotted a certain amount of time as you're entering information - so I would imagine the car was ""pending"" while someone else was doing that, but once they didn't complete the process it became available again."
1659	August 6, 2019 2:50AM	benjaminh	So you got the GTI?! Congrats!
1660	August 6, 2019 2:57AM	breld	"Thanks! It's scheduled to be delivered a week from Friday (the 16th).

Regarding back seat room, I was gonna say that car seats (particularly those for infants) take up loads of space. Once you ""graduate"" into booster seats and then no car seats at all, it becomes much less of an issue. Well...until your 16 year old gets to be 6' 2"". But then he's driving anyway!"
1661	August 6, 2019 3:05AM	roadburner	I test drove a 2015 STI; a lot of fun, but my wife and I thought the experience was too similar to my lightly modified Mazdaspeed 3. Anyway, I was ready to go back to RWD for my track toy.
1662	August 6, 2019 3:06AM	stickguy	that was one reason I did not keep my Miata very long (I think about 8 months). I had 2 younger kids at the time (8 and 13 maybe?) and it was just hard to find a time to use it, since obviously couldn't take both of them, so usually could only take it out by myself, so it sat a lot.
1663	August 6, 2019 3:15AM	kyfdx	Okay, I could be ready to buy this by November, if you can wait that long.
1664	August 6, 2019 3:45AM	nyccarguy	If you zero in on exactly what you want, get a few quotes from some local dealers. It usually doesn’t cost anything to reach out to a LH broker. They are completely transparent. See what you can save and it will most likely offset the broker fee.
1665	August 6, 2019 4:28AM	tifighter	I clicked “like” for this post. What I like about it is that it was posted within 24 hrs of an earlier post that said it would be a “no-punch” year. Thank you for tireless commitment towards creating content for us @breld
1666	August 6, 2019 4:36AM	28firefighter	It’s truly dedication to a craft.
1667	August 6, 2019 4:44AM	breld	"And I really believed it when I posted earlier about the high probability of a ""no-punch"" year."
1668	August 6, 2019 4:50AM	cdnpinhead	"Think of it as shifting a manual transmission. If you're a heavy truck driver, you'll do 2-3 shifts to get across an intersection, and another 300 before the end of the day. Breld does this stuff in his sleep.

It's interesting to watch."
1669	August 6, 2019 9:19AM	tjc78	"I played with the numbers the dealer gave me and we are about 2000-2500 apart to hit virtually the same deal as the LH brokers (figuring the $400 fee). The one on LH is missing about $1600 of options the one I drove last night had.

I think I can do it locally, but if not I would probably just go the broker route."
1670	August 6, 2019 9:22AM	tjc78	"@stickguy

I have a trip this week, so unless I can go Sat it won’t be until next week.

I can’t imagine not loving the S60 since I loved the S90 I rented. We will see, this is the fun part doing all the test drives.

I haven’t done this for awhile. The Enclave was a phone deal and the Elantra was a quick deal where I didn’t drive anything else."
1671	August 6, 2019 10:39AM	sda	Congrats, pics when you get a chance. I wasn’t fast enough to see them on Carvana. I assume you sold the Miata at the same time?
1672	August 6, 2019 11:17AM	ab348	Not sure if I should be proud or ashamed for being the enabler that made you fall off the wagon.
1673	August 6, 2019 11:20AM	stickguy	Carvana to Breld is like an on-line casino to a gambling addict. when you can, on a whim, any time of day or night just pull out your phone and click one button to buy a car, there really is very little in the way of checks and balances in place!
1674	August 6, 2019 11:21AM	stickguy	I need to look at CHV to see if they got any into their loaner fleet yet. The 2018 I looked at (fully loaded up) was a screaming deal. I just did not want black over black. And waited a bit too long anyway.
1675	August 6, 2019 11:58AM	marcogallo1986	@breld congratulations, see I don’t come in here for a few days and you’re back at it again that’s awesome.

The S60 pricing gets up there really quickly! I'd like to find a loaner T6 Inscription to try and hack a deal on. There really aren't that many Volvo dealers nealr us, so to get a good deal I may have to go over the bridge or north.

Salesman last night seemed a little surprised I was cross shopping the Volvo with the Infiniti. I wasn't sure why, they are in the same class, no?

@breld
Awesome!"
1677	August 6, 2019 12:24PM	stickguy	"seems like a natural comparison. same basic size, class and price.

I was looking at the T5. I am fine with FWD on it, and that has enough HP already. My guess is loaners are not going to be a T6.

I never got serious enough to start venturing out of the area, but I have never had a problem when shopping getting CH to work on price. I did talk to Princeton at one point, and there are always the dealers in PA. Red Bank is a good option too I think, and not that far away."
1678	August 6, 2019 12:29PM	tjc78	On LH they have some really high MSRP T6 loaners, still more than I want to spend but crazy deals on mid to high 50s MSRP. Some have the B&W audio which is a 3,000 option. I would love to have that as I have B&W speakers in my house, but that's a pretty steep price.
1679	August 6, 2019 12:35PM	stickguy	"well, I was wrong. they do have some. The T6 are momentums, but if you get the options (multimedia, premium) it pretty much comes out to be an Inscription.

this one is loaded. Gorgeous color.

nice T5 inscription, other than black guts. Too bad it doesn't have blond or amber. I would like this configuration, minus the 19"" wheels.

Neither did he."
1684	August 6, 2019 1:37PM	nyccarguy	@breld - did you even test drive a GLI?
1685	August 6, 2019 1:44PM	stickguy	Give that a couple of months
1686	August 6, 2019 1:47PM	stickguy	Last year, when I was considering a fun/manual trans car, I drove a GLI and WRX back to back. VW drove like a Lexus in comparison (and that’s a compliment). I found the Sube to be kinda rough, noisy and crude. Rorty is an old term that fits it. At my age, not what I was looking for, and my wife, really not a fan!
1687	August 6, 2019 2:11PM	pensfan83	If I was single, a decade younger, and my commute was minimal I'd take a WRX. As others have said the GTI does so many things well and the refinement is leaps and bounds above the Subaru.
1688	August 6, 2019 2:11PM	corvette	One of my friends got a Mustang GT to replace a 2005-ish BMW 6-series. He traded the Mustang on a WRX and very quickly got rid of the WRX. He has a newer 6-series now.
1689	August 6, 2019 2:13PM	pensfan83	I thought I saw someone picked up a high MSRP T6 R-Design for $370/month. Not sure if it was a loaner but that's a great value.
1690	August 6, 2019 2:21PM	tjc78	Yeah but probably pretty close to 3000 OOP. The one broker shows payments under 400 but with 2500 DAS w/o tax and broker fee for R-designs.
1691	August 6, 2019 2:35PM	stickguy	From the little looking I’ve done, it really seems like the designer models (R, polestar) don’t offer enough for the price extra money. Even a lighter option momentum is very well equipped.
1692	August 6, 2019 2:43PM	carnaught	Wow, over $5k dealer add-ons on that first S60 one.
1693	August 6, 2019 3:00PM	breld	"Yes, yes I did. Well, I don't take delivery until a week from Friday.

And like @tjc78 pointed out, I didn't really see it coming either. I guess it goes back to earlier in the year when I was strongly entertaining the idea of trading it for that manual Clubman S. I'm very happy I didn't do that and kept the Miata for most of the Spring/Summer season. But I don't see myself holding on to it through another winter season to fully enjoy it again next year, so decided to ""just browse"" for a more practical fun car. At the end of the day, and I think everyone will agree, I think the GTI will be a much better choice than the Mini would have been.

Of all my trades, the Miata certainly was a rare positive one - paid $25,000 last August, and trading it to Carvana this month, just about one year later, for $23,253. That was definitely worth it to me to own the RF for a year. And I didn't even have to service it."
1694	August 6, 2019 3:02PM	breld	Shame!
1695	August 6, 2019 3:05PM	breld	"@tjc78 - just like @stickguy, I anxiously await your assessment of the S60. I imagine it will be a very different take on the luxury/sport sedan than the Infiniti, so it'll be interesting to see how it strikes you.

I would say a V90 is the current front-runner to replace my Q7 when that time comes. But (famous last words) - that is no time soon."
1696	August 6, 2019 3:17PM	breld	"I didn't. The pricing in my area is getting better, but not all that aggressive yet (and of course no used ones are yet available). And while I like the GLI, we do have a current gen Jetta in the family already and, more significantly, it does nothing for my wife. In contrast, she adores the Golf/GTI.

The Miata was ""all me"" for sure, so getting a fun car that she also likes this time around is a good thing."
1697	August 6, 2019 3:29PM	28firefighter	I love the way the GLI drives and once behind the wheel you forget its a Jetta quickly. The GTI really gets me though.
1698	August 6, 2019 3:42PM	Michaell	"As the person who likes to go against the grain, the GLI appeals to me more. But, once inside, you can tell the difference in heritage between the Golf / Jetta with the interior components. I find the Golf / Alltrack / GTI to be a bit more luxurious than the Jetta.

Not that I'd kick either out of the garage.

Down to my last couple of weeks with the Jetta - will go back on the 19th, and I'll be in CA for 6 of those days. 16,4xx miles on it, and I may have to put a splash of gas in it before then.

I also set up a service appointment for the Outback. 30K service, which is a bunch of inspections, along with an oil change and a replacement of the air filter. I think it's been driven maybe 1000-1500 miles in the last 4 months."
1699	August 6, 2019 4:09PM	marcogallo1986	So this weekend Sunday to get out in the car Sunday night late and yesterday Monday with my cousin, you’re so help me paint down all the oil pan bowls and went to go buy a new oil drain plug did it will change oil leak is a lot better the time being, but have a new oil pan coming, since the new drain bolt gets tight 10 spoons, the threads on the oil pan are screwed up, won’t fall out but please it anyway, oil pan gasket. Also the wind valve cover gasket‘s too.
1700	August 6, 2019 4:10PM	marcogallo1986	Also did a power steering fluid change by turning the wheel lock to lock with the car off, and he return line cough in a bottle.
1701	August 6, 2019 4:10PM	tjc78	"The Elantra is due for service now, I think I'm going to let it go and just turn it in needing an oil change.

It won't have more than 1000 miles over the interval. I think it will be fine. I am taking it to Baltimore from South Jersey tomorrow but that's still under 250 miles."
1702	August 6, 2019 4:10PM	marcogallo1986	What a work out that was but enjoyed it. So I think that’s it for now with it, oh took it to a drive-through car wash it’s the cleanest it’s ever been it’s me washing it in the driveway ha ha.

Taking the TLX to Saratoga (Lear jet is in the shop!). Will roll over 5,000 miles by the time we get home, approaching 8 month of ownership mark. RDX turns 7 YO 1 month from now, and will likely be sitting at about 56,000. We need to drive more, but makes it a lot easier to keep it around long term."
1705	August 6, 2019 5:13PM	roadburner	Still contemplating installing an LSD and a mild tune in the 2 Series instead of picking up something new(er). So far I’ve found an American, an Asian, and a German coupe- any of which might work.
1706	August 6, 2019 5:17PM	xwesx	Nice work! That's the way to do it. It's very controlled, thorough, and you don't end up wasting much new fluid (by mixing it with the old).
1707	August 6, 2019 6:38PM	pensfan83	My guesses, American=Bullitt Mustang, German=CPO M2 (maybe a 440i), Asian is a tough one.

1714	August 6, 2019 7:15PM	qbrozen	Re: S60. I've been keeping my eyes peeled for a few months now. Actually, T5 loaners are scarce, believe it or not. And, if leasing, the Momentum is the worst deal. Just ran the numbers for a friend yesterday and found, given the same percentage discount off MSRP, a $56k R design works out to just $10/mo more than a $48k Momentum. Inscription and R design work out to about the same, but Rdes still has higher MSRP.
1715	August 6, 2019 7:32PM	pensfan83	"@tjc78 this was the one I was thinking of. Only $715 due at signing so just first payment and drive offs. No mention of MSDs and I'm guessing no B&W sound but for that price I would live with the stock stereo.

1718	August 6, 2019 7:50PM	qbrozen	Picked up my 3 this morn. So happy to have it back. They did a fantastic job. I honestly can't tell anything has been done. Even the door jamb is clean. This is my 4th time at a body shop, and it is the first time I didn't have to request they fix something they missed or screwed up.
1719	August 6, 2019 8:52PM	breld	@qbrozen - Wow! Given how quickly they got through the repair, I'm astonished that you didn't have to point anything out to get touched up or otherwise addressed.
1720	August 6, 2019 9:12PM	marcogallo1986	@QB Nice you got it back in record time and glad all is well with it.
1721	August 6, 2019 9:13PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest agreed my cousin was a big help wouldn’t have been able to do it on my own, I worked up a sweat by loved it.
1722	August 6, 2019 9:13PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest also think God for him and his good eyes to see if you or your weeks help me pinpoint what I need to fix what parts I needed to order, even help me with the ordering of the parts to make sure they exactly look the same.
1723	August 6, 2019 10:00PM	roadburner	Great news! That was pretty much the case when the Mazda body shop fixed my MS3. I even called the body shop manager and told him what a great job the shop did.
1724	August 6, 2019 10:05PM	roadburner	370Z is correct. It’s old school in some ways I like(NA V6) and it’s old school in some ways I don’t(crude telematics- no mobile app access). I will have to drive the candidates and see.
1725	August 6, 2019 10:36PM	pensfan83	Was I right on the others or are you keeping it close to the vest?
1726	August 6, 2019 10:39PM	corvette	As the owner of the four door equivalent of the 370z, I approve of this line of thinking.
1727	August 6, 2019 11:30PM	stickguy	The Q60 seems to be the more modern version of the Z. A little bigger, but conceptually not all that far off.
1728	August 7, 2019 2:03AM	nyccarguy	@roadburner - I think you’ll enjoy the 3.7L N/A V6 a lot. It makes up for the Z’s other shortcomings. It won’t give you that daily driver/track star personality that your 2er gives you. I think a mechanical LSD would be an incredible upgrade. Once you drive with that for a while, then go for the tune.
1729	August 7, 2019 2:14AM	roadburner	Yep; Bullitt and M2.
1730	August 7, 2019 11:41AM	qbrozen	A tune on the 370? It won't do much. Within reason, there is very little extra power to be extracted from that car with simple bolt-ons.
1731	August 7, 2019 11:45AM	stickguy	doesn't it already have in the neighborhood of 328HP? Isn't enough ever enough? If not, skip the tune, and just slap a blower on it.
1732	August 7, 2019 12:10PM	nyccarguy	I meant to put an LSD & a tune on his 2 series.
1733	August 7, 2019 12:16PM	tjc78	I am all for more power ...however, after driving the Infiniti with 5 second 0-60 I think that’s more than enough to get me in trouble.
1734	August 7, 2019 12:54PM	stickguy	the Elantra is enough to get you in trouble. The Infiniti is enough to get you in jail.
1735	August 7, 2019 1:53PM	roadburner	I’m looking at a NISMO- 350 hp. Torque is down compared to the 2 Series, however. The Z runs the 1/4 in the mid thirteens, the 2er in the high twelves. I’ll need to take a long test drive to see if I could live with it.
1736	August 7, 2019 2:19PM	corvette	I hadn’t looked at the 3-series lineup in a while. Nice to see they finally dumped the 320i.
1737	August 7, 2019 2:27PM	roadburner	I drove a 320i stick with the Track Handling Package. It was actually a lot of fun. A mild tune would bump the power up to 328i levels. A bit of a unicorn, however.
1738	August 7, 2019 2:42PM	stickguy	To me, a sport package 320 is probably closest to the traditional BMW that all the purists reminisce about. But didn’t actually buy.
1739	August 7, 2019 2:53PM	corvette	I understand, but wasn’t the 0-60 in the 7 second range? That looked bad.
1740	August 7, 2019 3:06PM	28firefighter	Yes. 320i stick with track handling handled great but was sluggish.
1741	August 7, 2019 3:16PM	stickguy	"That’s plenty for probably 99% of people, 99% of the time. And way faster than the classic ones.

I was looking more at respectable power, a stick, well balanced handling, etc.

If the goal is a hellcat, they make those too!

I almost bought a 168 hp 525i back in 2001. I kept hearing that is was “too slow”, but I found it plenty quick off the line, and had great mid range pull. 30 to 70 down an on-ramp, did great there. Plus, you can use the stick to keep the revs up when you need more scoot on tap.

I’d rather have that than something with so much power you have to feather the gas from a stop, and can’t ever take it over 2k RPM.

Maybe I’m a Luddite, but I find my 4 banger TLX to be plenty spritely. The RDX is a little hot rod if you floor it."

1744	August 7, 2019 3:44PM	breld	"Regarding power, I particularly enjoy the way the Miata drives with its relatively low power and naturally aspirated engine. It's very engaging to row through the gears without getting to illegal speeds too quickly.

I can see the appeal of the 370z as an old school choice. As I mentioned before, I hadn't driven a Nissan or Infiniti in a while until I had that Maxima as a rental last week - that ""old school"" V6 is pretty sweet. And as dated as the 370z may be, I was next to one earlier this week and still find the design of it appealing. The NISMO model is particularly sharp."

1747	August 7, 2019 4:01PM	28firefighter	Beautiful. That was worthwhile waiting then on GLI.
1748	August 7, 2019 5:29PM	roadburner	I like the Miata as well; the thing is, with my Club Sport I already have a “momentum car.”
1749	August 7, 2019 6:12PM	marcogallo1986	@Ray, did you get a new ride? If so congratulations on the punch, if not yet then whoops my bad, from the sound of the posting above seems like you might have.
1750	August 7, 2019 6:24PM	pensfan83	The Acura moves pretty quick if you want it to or it will loaf along at 75MPH around 1,600 RPM. I've grown to appreciate the linear and smooth power delivery of the V6.
1751	August 7, 2019 6:29PM	28firefighter	TLX V6 A-Spec SH AWD looks like it could be a bit better than normal. There is an additional $1250 in loyalty/conquest money on top of the $9100 in lease cash. Even with the astronomical MF and pitiful residual, you could still get a 36/10 lease with first month and tags in the very low 400s. Assuming you can find any leftover 2019 stock.

1753	August 7, 2019 7:24PM	stickguy	"Had a major sad today. Cut a corner too close and curb the heck out of my right front wheel. Thankfully tire seems OK, and hopefully no alignment issues, but the poor rim looks terrible. I guess I’ll find out if my auto club wheel protection is going to cover it. If not, might be repairable but I assume that takes a while. And I really don’t want to know how much a new one costs.

Serves me right for getting fancy wheels and low profile tires. Never again. Told the wife, next car will be an F250."
1754	August 7, 2019 7:36PM	corvette	Better curb protection is a bonus of switching to a plus-zero tire size.
1755	August 7, 2019 7:37PM	kyfdx	"If the Plus ZERO is done correctly, the sidewall be the exact same height..

If it's taller, you are just putting on the wrong size.."
1756	August 7, 2019 7:52PM	pensfan83	@stickguy I feel your pain, I have a 1 inch scratch from catching a curb at the drive up ATM. I don't know how you feel but with the darker rims it seems like it shows more.
1757	August 7, 2019 7:57PM	breld	"My 16 year old called me at 11:00 the other night (on his way home) to say he took a left turn a bit too sharply and curbed the driver's side rear tire. Apparently it scared the heck out of him - and the tire was completely flat.

So...given it's an older Acura with an actual spare tire, it was a sort of fun opportunity to show him how to change a tire out. And then we just drove it over to the local Discount Tire and left it there for the night.

The tires were going to have to be replaced soon-ish anyway, so we just put on four new tires. Overall it was a good lesson for him - scared him a bit, made him more aware of spacing on turns, and at the end of the day, there wasn't any horrible consequence."
1758	August 7, 2019 7:58PM	qbrozen	Never drove a 370, but I can speak to my 135 vs 350z. The 135 was obviously quite a bit faster, but also heavier, quieter, more ... civilized. The Z was a sportscar. I felt more connected to it, and it to the road. So they do serve different purposes, I think. And preference would be based on what you are looking for. A sportscar or a sportscruiser.

1760	August 7, 2019 8:38PM	Michaell	Way better than my 16 year old, for sure.
1761	August 7, 2019 8:42PM	28firefighter	"So, I have an etiquette question here. And I'm really sorry @isellhondas is not around anymore to weigh in since I'm pretty sure one of the dealers I was talking to was his old one.

You might know I've been helping a friend shop for a CR-V Touring for his Dad who is consolidating from two cars down to one. I researched trade values for both (courtesy of CarMax, Vroom, and our very own @qbrozen), and also did some due diligence on sale prices this month online and also soliciting quotes from a few area Honda dealers. Trade on car #1 (Honda Ridgeline) was the same from all 3 at $21k - nice and easy. Trade on car #2 (Miata) was all over the place - CarMax @ $13k, Q at $14k, and Vroom at $15k.

Dealer #1 gave me a very straight forward price of invoice including a few hundred bucks of accessories no one cares about. Dealer #2 gave a very aggressive price but then added close to $1000 in accessories and handling fees to make it within a few hundred bucks lower than Dealer #1, then told me to shop is number and come back when we realized it could not be beat - very pushy. Dealer #3 was higher than both before accessories.

Decided Dealer #1 was who we preferred to deal with - they were straightforward, polite, and very easy to deal with by email. They will also be the servicing dealer because they are closest. Decided to make an offer of trading both cars in and getting back about $2k in cash all fees included. The way I figured it was giving them their sale price, but asking for $15k on trade for the Miata and $21k on trade for the Ridgeline. Figuring I don't care how they want to show it on paper as the difference is the difference. They accepted - agreed it was fair for all.

Emailed Dealer #2 and Dealer #3 to let them know. Dealer #3 was very gracious, appreciated the opportunity and for letting them know. Dealer #2 got very upset with me, said they would match whatever and beat it by $500 and could not understand why we wouldn't go with the lowest price. I explained our stance and offered to follow-up if the other deal fell through. They got indignant and said they could not understand why we would not drive a bit further to save $500. I haven't responded because it seems like an unnecessary dialogue.

Even if we could have saved up to $500 by going to Dealer #2, it doesn't feel like behavior that should be rewarded. Friend and his Dad are on board completely with going to Dealer #1. Am I being as crazy as this sales person seems to think I am? Did I miss something here?"
1762	August 7, 2019 8:49PM	stickguy	"that was out of line by them. They should graciously say something like, hope we can do business in the future, and good luck to you.

probably, you are the first person to actually let them know you went elsewhere, and they did not know what to do!"
1763	August 7, 2019 8:50PM	qbrozen	you did nothing wrong, of course. I would just say that it isn't all about the lowest price and you feel more comfortable dealing with dealer 1. end of story.
1764	August 7, 2019 8:51PM	28firefighter	I also have a problem with this notion of someone trying to get us to back out of a deal already agreed to. If the tables were turned, they'd be furious.
1765	August 7, 2019 8:52PM	stickguy	"on the wheel, the downside to a gray finish. when you scrape it, you get down to the aluminum, so you really see the difference. on a polished wheel, it is the same color, just with some scratches.

I did check the place I got a replacement wheel once for my Odyssey when it was bent. Turns out, only $265, with free shipping. So, not as bad as I thought. Plus of course, cost of mounting. an expensive lesson to pay better attention to curbs that stick out.

I do need to call the warranty place to see what if anything they will do. especially if just scraped, not busted."
1766	August 7, 2019 9:17PM	pensfan83	I went through the same thing with the Acura, agreeing with a deal with one Acura dealer because they were the most straightforward and open. When I let the first dealer I inquired with know my decision they immediately said they would cut the price, albeit only by several hundred dollars and reminded me that I said at the outset I hoped to do business with them. They weren't as erratic with their comments but said they never knew anyone to turn down a lower price. Admittedly I almost did go back to them but realized I wouldn't appreciate having an offer pulled back on me.
1767	August 7, 2019 9:22PM	ronsteve	"Agreed, stick. If you get on it with that V6 it'll move, and make you forget what type of vehicle you're actually driving. On the flipside, it's easy to end up in no-man's land sometimes with the VCM in a highway cruise setting when you need to hit a gap or something. The RDX a very strange performer that way, like you have to either be fully committed to either a very tame or a very sporty driving demeanor.

I'm a bit of a luddite myself with things like Nav/CarPlay/nanny technology, spare tires, gears putting power to the ground, but with the power itself I have come to appreciate turbos. We'll see if turbo power brings my inner CCB out to play before I would otherwise."
1768	August 7, 2019 9:26PM	ronsteve	28FF, you're doing the right thing continuing with Dealer #1, *especially* since that's where you plan to get your service. If their deal goes south and you go somewhere else, that's on them, but if you back out of a deal with the eventual servicing dealer, they might remember that.
1769	August 7, 2019 9:36PM	breld	28ff - agreed you're doing the right thing. I would simply tell the other dealer that your intention was not to pit dealers against each other, and that they should have simply come forward with their best pricing in the first place. Hard to argue with that (though they probably would).
1770	August 7, 2019 9:41PM	kyfdx	Just let it go... the world is full of unprofessional dealership personnel. You did nothing wrong.
1771	August 7, 2019 10:11PM	tifighter	Something tells me I could probably guess who dealer #2 is.
1772	August 7, 2019 10:11PM	au1994	No you did nothing wrong @28firefighter. I don’t want to add fuel to the fire of hating on car dealers because there are some, as you found, that are easy and fair to deal with. It’s the rest that drives me nuts.
1773	August 7, 2019 10:18PM	au1994	"That was quite sporty for the day. Mustangs were putting out in the 235 range with a big ol honkin V8.

I’m sure there has been a case study done but it seems to me that 220-230 is about the perfect usable HP range. Our X6, the F30 335i and the E93 335i all had 300+ hp and were flat out fast. At least in a straight line in the case of the F30. My ZHP was 235 and while not neck snapping quick off the line, pulled like a freight train otherwise."
1774	August 7, 2019 10:32PM	tifighter	I'm finding the 470-ish hp on the 3 to be workable. It pulls pretty well.
1775	August 7, 2019 10:35PM	28firefighter	It’s not Klein. I don’t even waste my time with them.
1776	August 7, 2019 10:50PM	corvette	Not taller, but I meant that the wider tread will cause the sidewall to protrude slightly further from the edge of the wheel.

1781	August 8, 2019 1:20AM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter, you did nothing wrong good on the choice of the dealer that your dad‘s friend. I rather deal with a dealer that straight up front and transparent and doesn’t play games any day. I have a dealers around here play games, I realize that recently helping my neighbor look for a new lease on another car we still have to go look at stuff soon the lease is up at the end of September. Anyway most dealers won’t give me numbers over the phone or email you tell me you have to come in and I said I don’t want to I want all the numbers upfront and then we’ll go from there. Only the one Hyundai dealer near me here give me numbers over the phone and wasn’t pushy inside And told me come in whenever you want to test drive the cars and if they like them will move forward if not at least they know which was good that’s the way all dealer should be which is rare. I’ve been had dealers last year when I was looking for my mom, tell me oh we can’t give you numbers over the phone because of confidentiality rules I told him to stop with the nonsense I don’t have time in a nice way of course. There’s one other nice dealer I don’t with you give me numbers through text it was a GMC dealer but I would go deal with here I remember the guys name to me told me he was there for 20 something years.
1782	August 8, 2019 1:21AM	marcogallo1986	@QB what’s that truck you posted about I know it’s a blue but what is it?
1783	August 8, 2019 1:22AM	stickguy	Dodge Durango. Hot rod version.
1784	August 8, 2019 1:24AM	marcogallo1986	@ Ray, oh OK other five lease payments then you’re gonna have the car you mentioned on the Tire page most likely. Very nice very nice. Hope all is been going well with you and your family.
1785	August 8, 2019 1:58AM	breld	While it was starting to be a bit outdated, I certainly liked my Durango R/T. There are days I wish I would have just kept that.
1786	August 8, 2019 2:23AM	kyfdx	So, did you buy it?

1790	August 8, 2019 11:49AM	roadburner	I agree.
1791	August 8, 2019 11:52AM	roadburner	What I really like about the BMW six cylinder turbos is how they make peak torque from just off idle to nearly 5000 rpm. At any speed you have a lot of thrust at your disposal.
1792	August 8, 2019 12:57PM	au1994	"Yep, they are awesome off the line. The X6 was also a great highway car. It would cruise forever at 80+ if you weren't careful. It was so quiet you hardly knew it. In Atlanta stop and go traffic, it was wasted of course.

While I love the Subaru and knew what I was getting into with its 152hp, its change your drivings style slow. I seriously had to rethink my merging and pulling out into traffic habits."
1793	August 8, 2019 3:28PM	jmonroe1	"Congrats on helping your friends father buy a car from an upfront dealer.

If you ever run into another situation like this, I would go back to the first dealer and say something like, ""Id really like to do business with you but another dealer has your price beat by more than just a couple bucks. Is there any way you can give me a better price""? What do you have to lose since you were going to buy from dealer number 1 anyway? As we like to say, ""if you don't ask, you don't get"". Just a suggestion.

jmonroe"
1794	August 8, 2019 3:34PM	28firefighter	I have done that before, @jmonroe and I may have done it here, if it didn't come across as a desperate move to get us in the door to Dealer #2. I have no confidence the deal would have materialized.
1795	August 8, 2019 4:43PM	marcogallo1986	@ Jay Monroe, I agree with your above posting hey with anything in life if you don’t ask you don’t know ha ha Ha I hope you’re trying to behave yourself this week, wait why am I asking such a silly question, you know both me and you and probably some others around here like always cause good trouble, but not bad trouble. lol
1796	August 8, 2019 4:45PM	marcogallo1986	@ stick guy, thank you nice
1797	August 8, 2019 4:47PM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter, I’m glad the purchase for your friends dad went off without a hitch. I always say deal with dealers that are upfront and don’t wanna waste your time, which seems harder and harder to find these days, the ones who do waste your time don’t go back. And room and Havana or the weight of the future I believe. The only thing that stinks with those there’s no haggling allowed right the price is what you pay with a list? And you can test drive the car prior you have to go to a dealer anyway to see if you’d even like it

I think it needed an alignment anyway. 3 of 4 wheels were out, and the worst one was the front on the other side. Tracks great now, and steering wheel nice and centered."
1801	August 8, 2019 7:24PM	28firefighter	I'd fix the wheel. Would drive me bananas to have a damaged wheel on a car that new.
1802	August 8, 2019 7:31PM	qbrozen	The v8 turbo is supposedly very robust and reliable, other than the plastic cooling tubes under the intake manifold, which can be taken care of by a resourceful owner.
1803	August 8, 2019 7:38PM	ab348	Yeah, you don't want that bare alloy metal exposed to salt over the winter. I curbed one of my ATS wheels the first month I had it, repair cost a bit over $100 including demounting./mounting so not too bad.
1804	August 8, 2019 8:19PM	nyccarguy	You really want to go to Staten Island to buy a car?
1805	August 8, 2019 9:19PM	stickguy	I sent an online request to an alloy wheel repair place. have not heard back yet. Not sure if they will be able to do this since it is painted. Plus, there is the time factor of having a car with 3 wheels. I might just pay a little extra and buy a new wheel, then just have it swapped on.
1806	August 8, 2019 9:45PM	28firefighter	So, in another phenomenal customer service experience, my wife and I were supposed to leave Sam for the weekend with my in-laws and fly to Chicago for a wedding. Of course, in true 28FF family tradition, Sam came home school the other day with 104 fever. Delta cancelled our flights and issued full-fare credit vouchers to us, completely waiving the cancellation fee. Said they didn't believe we should penalized for having a sick kid. I was and still am floored. I was expecting to pay $400 in cancellation fees.
1807	August 8, 2019 10:15PM	corvette	That was nice of them. OTOH, they probably don’t want the potential liability of having a sick person on their plane.
1808	August 8, 2019 10:16PM	corvette	The wheel medic places generally can repair painted wheels. I’m sure it’s not true anymore, but it used to be that many wheels used the same color silver paint.

1812	August 8, 2019 10:34PM	breld	"Speaking of wheel damage, I mentioned I had the opportunity to show my son how to change a tire the other night when he curbed a rear wheel/tire making a turn a little too sharp.

He felt really bad and I told him that it happens and I've even been known to do it.

Well I proved it this afternoon. I took a right turn a bit too sharp in my Q7 and curbed the driver's side rear wheel/tire. Apparently the tire took the brunt of it, which is good for the wheel, but the tire had a small split on the side.

So I learned how to use the repair/inflater pump (with the tire sealant) which surprisingly got me to Discount Tire.

Apparently these tires, which came off a 2019 Q7, aren't rated adequately for a 2018 Q7 - makes no sense to me, but bottom line Discount wouldn't install the same tire. So they're giving me a credit for the 3 undamaged tires and I ordered 4 new Michelins to be installed tomorrow.

My son feels better about his little ordeal now."
1813	August 8, 2019 10:39PM	kyfdx	"That stuff drives me nuts.

I took a set of wheels off of a '95 M3 to Costco, because they had a killer deal on Pilot Super Sports.
Original size is 235/40-17, which almost no one makes, any more. The replacement size most used is 225/45-17.

The guy at Costco: ""You know, that isn't the correct size for the '95 M3""..
Yeah, do you have any 235/40-17, in any brand tire?
""No, but this is still the wrong size""..
That's okay, just go ahead and put them on.
""I'll mount them, but if the car was here, I wouldn't be able to install them. Because the width is smaller than stock.""

My ex popped a fairly new tire on an S40 once. I went to Costco to replace one tire, they refused due to wear, ok fine I’ll take 2, put the older ones on the back and new ones on the front. No, they said, our requirement is to replace all 4. Took it down the road to somewhere else who was happy just to replace one tire."

1816	August 8, 2019 11:46PM	xwesx	"I generally prefer to have new tires mounted without the car involved. It is easier for me, and it avoids the shop doing anything stupid, like messing up my lug studs/bolts or getting into a pissing match about what tires should or should not go on said car.

I do the research, order the tires, and bring in the wheels. They install, and they don't ask more questions than I plan to answer. Funny enough, my biggest issue with most tire shops is arguing with me about TPMS sensors (I don't want them, don't need them, and won't pay for them).

Other than balancing, it is on me if if anything goes wrong with the install. That's just the way I prefer it!"
1817	August 8, 2019 11:51PM	xwesx	"@breld Oh, the irony of that timing! Hahahaha! Great perspective for your son, though.

I can recall a single time when I curbed a wheel: Ohiopyle, parallel parking our rental Impala back in May of 2016. We were stopping at the little local pizza joint they have there (some of you may know it). I had two things working against me: 1., rental car that had crap mirrors, and 2., was parking on the left side of the street (one way). I think that is the one and only time I have ever done a left side parallel park maneuver, and boy did I feel bad about that poor wheel.

I did, however, split the inner sidewall on my wife's Forester one time when I was doing a sort of off-roading stunt to access a parking lot that was blocked off due to some sort of road construction. I thought I was being clever, but I missed the parking bumper (those concrete wheel blocks they have in some lots) just slightly on the right rear tire, the wheel slipped off the side of the bumper as it was starting to climb over, and it just split the sidewall as it slid down.

My wife was not impressed; I ended up getting a full replacement set the following summer (just used the full-size spare for the remainder of that season), and I was very glad that it was the factory tires on the car at the time."
1818	August 9, 2019 1:18AM	sda	"stickguy said:
I sent an online request to an alloy wheel repair place. have not heard back yet. Not sure if they will be able to do this since it is painted. Plus, there is the time factor of having a car with 3 wheels. I might just pay a little extra and buy a new wheel, then just have it swapped on.
Can you get some black touch up paint and carefully fill in the damage? I had some Billet Silver touch up paint from a previous Pilot that is a very close match to the silver on the of the wheels on the TL. I touched up some minor curb rash. Unless you look for it, your eye is not automatically drawn to the damage."
1819	August 9, 2019 2:44AM	stickguy	"it isn't black. it's gray. and it is way too much to fill in, and would need smoothing first. If I can't find a repair outfit to get back to me, I will just order a replacement and when it arrives, take it over to the shop and have them swap the tire onto it.

I actually got one a while back for my Odyssey. Had one wheel bent enough that they couldn't ever get it balanced right, so i just bought a new one, and problem solved."

1824	August 9, 2019 3:36AM	fintail	That would drive me nuts. I remember a few years ago while on a trip, I pulled out awkwardly from an odd curb in a parking lot, and put a mark on a wheel, maybe the size of a quarter or two. Drove me nuts, had it fixed within being home for a couple days. And this was on a leased car where I probably could have had it forgiven - but looking at it every day would challenge my already marginal sanity.
1825	August 9, 2019 3:41AM	28firefighter	See if you can replace it and then get a credit for trading in the busted wheel.
1826	August 9, 2019 10:40AM	sda	The curse of low profile tires. I clipped a curb pulling into the parking garage last year in the Accord and feared the worst. Luckily it only made a light scuff on the tire which disappeared when it was washed. I feel your frustration.

https://www.motortrend.com/cars/honda/civic/2019/2019-honda-civic-2020-toyota-corolla-2019-mazda3-comparison-test/

""Mazda's move to ditch the independent rear suspension has been a gossip topic in the auto industry, but the key question remains: Is it still fun to drive? The Mazda3's 2.5-liter engine is pretty robust and hasn't really changed much since the previous generation. The transmission also feels jerky when driving at low speeds. But our biggest critique was—you guessed it—the new torsion-beam suspension, which dramatically changed the driving dynamics on twisty roads and broken pavement.

""Moving to a torsion beam detracted from the car,"" Ogbac said. ""It has a good ride on glass-smooth surfaces, but it feels less sophisticated than before and loses composure once it has to deal with successive imperfections."" Example: The rear end bounced sharply side to side when driving over a midcorner bump."""

I got to watch about ten minutes of Netflix on my iPad and then they told me mine was ready, too.

Weirdly, they measured my tires at 7/32"" (after only about 7,500 miles on the tires). I suspect they were being conservative, as the last time I checked a few weeks ago, they were around 8 to 9/32"".

Edit: False alarm on the tires. Checked with my digital Fowler X-tread depth gauge as well as an analog one. They're still at 8.5-9/32"". Oddly, when you measure them with the analog gauge, they do show as 7mm, so I'm guessing the tech was using a similar gauge and read mm instead of x/32""."

1857	August 11, 2019 12:27AM	pensfan83	"Back from the dealer. I realize the picture is cut off but a Tundra was in the way, haha. I'll get better ones soon.

It is a lease for 2 years, 24K miles. It isn't one of the LH deals, however I was able to get what I thought was an extremely comparable deal in my own backyard. It's a one pay lease and the monthly averages out to $250.XX/month on a $39.7K truck. If it were a manual it would probably be under $230/month but with the Mrs. that wasn't happening. It has the tech package (blind spot, rear parking sensors, cross traffic) but no premium. We decided we could do without heated leather, sunroof, and auto climate. The most important thing is I had buy in from the wife and she approved of the color selection, which I also like.

As far as usage this will become mostly my vehicle. My commute is a few miles 3 days/week to the park and ride lot and the other 2 days it will sit in the driveway or go with my wife. After almost 2 years the Acura has just under 12,000 miles and it's just not used enough to justify the payment. My wife loves it so she'll start using it more but she's already said she'll have no problem taking the truck either. Additionally the idea of having a vehicle with more utility that we can use for trips to Lowe's, Costco, or hauling baseball equipment without folding seats or taking 2 cars is appealing. I never thought of myself as a truck person but oddly I find myself really liking the driving experience. It's a little loud and rough riding (almost oversprung), but it looks good inside and out and the quality is top notch.

As for the Altima we have a handshake agreement to sell it to a family a few houses down whose son will be of driving age in November. It just so happened we were both at another neighbor's house on national night out and were chatting and he mentioned they were on the hunt for a sedan for their son to learn to drive on so one thing lead to another and that transfer should be completed within a few weeks."

1863	August 11, 2019 4:09AM	andres3	"Did I mention my Audi Dealer hooked me up with brand new OEM Pirelli P7's on all 4 corners? This tire is actually pretty good for the first 15,000 miles based on reviews. Brand new, they are very quiet, nice riding, and good grip. I think the bad reviews are from their worsening performance as they age.

As far as fixing the vibrations in the steering wheel, it did the trick 110%. The old tires were shot worse than I realized. Funny, the tech said they should have been replaced (and needed to be replaced) on the CPO car for safety reasons due to the dry rot ""cracking"" on every outside shoulder block. The tech said at 65 MPH they didn't notice unusual vibration though! LOL. When I got the new tires, I imagine he must have been wearing padded boxing gloves while driving to not notice the vibration. I thought it was most noticeable at 80 +, but once the new tires were received, I came to the realization it was noticeable at 5 MPH, and at all speeds for that matter. Night and Day.

They also refilled the refrigerant and say the AC is ""within' spec now. NO leaks. However, I still feel the AC is at 85%, the jury is still out on that one. It doesn't cool like my TTS does.

Speaking of which, the TTS will be going in for the big 35K mile service soon. Maybe in 2 weeks. Maybe I""ll do it early this next week."

Anyway, I figured out why Audi's reliability score has improved so much over the past few years. The dealer kept the car all day for a laundry list of no-charge preventative ""service campaigns,"" which apparently included proactively replacing the window regulators(!). Kind of odd that VW would continue to under-engineer window regulators, after the whole debacle with them using plastic ones which would get brittle and break on the MKIV platform."

The only issue I’ve observed (and it seems to be common on the Audi forums) is that the reverse automatic braking system will sometimes engage for no reason (making a sound like you’ve just curbed a wheel), and not provide any sort of notification that it engaged.

1872	August 12, 2019 12:05AM	jmonroe1	"OK, that's a fair question so I'll answer it.

In 2006 I was looking to get Mrs. j another car. The dealer on the other side of town gave me a pretty good price via email but I wanted to do a sanity check to see what the local guy would do. Since the local guy was less that 3 miles away I decided to just go in and see what he could do. I had my folder with me and I told the local guy he had to beat the email price I had in my folder. He said, ""let me see the price I have to beat"". I told him the other guy didn't ask what price he had to beat, he just gave me his price. The local guy said something like, ""at least give me a ball park number"". I told him ""NO, if he wanted to make a sale he had to give one price and only one price"". He pauses then says, ""wait here let me talk to my manager"". A couple minutes later both the salesman and his manager walk into the room. The manager says, I understand you're sitting on a pretty good price, let me see it"". I told him NO too. Then I said, ""I'm sorry I wasted my time coming in"" and I push my chair back and started to get up. The manager then tells me his price which was better than the first guys by almost a hundred bucks. Since I didn't want to run to the other side of town anyway, I took his deal even though I didn't like the game playing. I guess you could say I wasn't willing to cut off my nose to spite my face.

The way I buy cars is fairly simple; give me your best price and I'll decide if it's good enough.

Talked about her taking some test drives since it won’t last forever. About 40K on the clock after almost eleven years. Talked to wife as I took her to the train station this morning, an IRS convention in Orlando till Friday. Got her to agree to take the kid shopping so she’ll know what to get when the time comes. Figure it’s better to get one you really like instead of rushing when the old vehicle gives up the ghost. Best to buy when you can just walk away if you don’t like the price or the dealership. But, she first needs to have an idea what comes next.

1893	August 13, 2019 1:35AM	nyccarguy	"So speaking of naturally aspirated V6s, I dropped my Infiniti off at the mechanic this AM to have a new set of rear brake rotors and pads installed. I went with Brembo OE replacement vented rotors and Brembo Pads. I was going to order the parts off of one of the many auto parts websites as they were less expensive than direct from Brembo. I called the Brembo customer service number to just make sure that the Hawk pads I originally wanted would fit. The guy who called me back could not have been nicer. I told him that I’d rather order direct, but Rock Auto has the rotors so much cheaper. Then he asked if I was going to use the Brembo pads. I told him honestly I hadn’t thought of it, but the Brembo website says they are out of stock. The guy basically matched Rock Auto’s price, so a I said “why not” to the pads.

$142 including tax for the rear pads & rotors. $150 for the mechanic to install.

The dealer wanted $410 to resurface the rear rotors & change the rear pads. They wanted $610 to change he the rear rotors and pads."
1894	August 13, 2019 1:43AM	breld	@pensfan83 - how does that Supra look in person?
1895	August 13, 2019 1:57AM	stickguy	"the wife seems to be getting closer to new wheels. the other day she popped out with an ""I want a new car"". Said this one smelled old, and did something else (banged around in the back?) Your basic setting up justifications. of course, every time she said it she followed it up with ""but I don't want to pay for it""! I gave her a target (finish paying off the last of the college expenses) and she could treat herself.

Not sure she will be able to handle something fancy. She was trying to do something with the radio in the TLX and getting all confused. And complained about being complicated, and she liked her current simple set-up. She might have a nervous breakdown with a new BMW or MB. I think it is just a matter of learning it at the beginning then practicing. Easier if it is something you drive every day.

I actually think she would have loved the controls, radio, etc in the outback. Even though she seems to have something against them now."
1896	August 13, 2019 2:12AM	28firefighter	Can’t recommend the current gen Outback highly enough. I’m sure the new one will be intuitive too, but it’ll be different.
1897	August 13, 2019 2:17AM	sda	It really pays to shop around and still get quality.
1898	August 13, 2019 2:26AM	stickguy	I should have taken her out to look at it even though she did not want to. We looked at the previous (2012ish) generation before getting the RDX, and seriously considered it. But it was the 2.5i version, so not a fair fight. I was really surprised how nicely the 6 cyl 2019 drove.
1899	August 13, 2019 2:42AM	pensfan83	Actually I think it looks pretty good, it's slowly grown on me. It's low, wide, and has a nice profile overall and I think it looks better in person than in pictures. The cockpit is small, if you're over 6' I imagine it would be snug, but even still it looks like everything falls right into your hands. Even through the window it was hard to deny the BMW derived aspects of the car, from the shifter to the infotainment. The interior was all black and the layout straightforward. It was still there when we left albeit the dealer plate was removed so I guess they were after us in finance.
1900	August 13, 2019 2:58AM	laurasdada	Your BIL sounds like a quite smart, sophisticated and no doubt, handsome man...
1901	August 13, 2019 3:10AM	stickguy	He certainly thinks so!
1902	August 13, 2019 3:59AM	andres3	I vote for the supercharged 3.0 V6 in the S4, different than a turbo, but equally effective, and more linear and quicker to react to throttle inputs.
1903	August 13, 2019 4:05AM	andres3	"The 3.6 Outback is by far the best Subaru. The only weaknesses are two-fold for me:

1) The CVT, which the 3.6 masks nicely and convincingly, unlike the meager 2.5.
2) The fuel economy is a bit lackluster, but the 3.6 makes up for it with great power. What are you getting for real world gas mileage?"
1904	August 13, 2019 4:47AM	28firefighter	Beats me. Probably somewhere in the 20s. I’ll check next time I fill up. @Michaell may be able to tell you what he is seeing.
1905	August 13, 2019 11:59AM	nyccarguy	@28firefighter - I'm glad Sam is doing better. 104 for a week straight isn't fun for him or you
1906	August 13, 2019 12:08PM	nyccarguy	I completely forgot about that. I drove one in an XT5 from a few years ago and was very impressed with thar 3.6L V6.
1907	August 13, 2019 12:27PM	tjc78	"I've been there with the kids... not fun at all (a little scary, actually)

On the car front.

Last night I test drove the S60. It was kind of a weird experience. I walk in, no S60s in the smallish showroom. I was greeted while looking at an XC90. Introduce myself and the gentleman says ""yes, I was waiting for you"".... Huh? Different Tom apparently. About 5 mins later the other Tom walks in and he turns me over to total Greenpea. She knows virtually nothing about the cars and admits to never selling an S60. Wonderful.

Moving onto the test drive. I drove a 49K T6 Momentum that was basically optioned as an Inscription. The car is really nice. The tech is great (if a little overwhelming at first), seats comfy, large moonroof. It was quick but didn't feel like 300+ HP. It's also pretty quiet, but the 19"" wheels caused a little harshness on the beat up test loop. There was plenty of room in the back for my kids and the trunk is nicely sized. In short, like I suspected from my S90 rental this is a car I could take home with me.

I ask for some numbers, and suggest (as @qbrozen mentioned and confirmed in the leasing forums) that the Inscription leased better due to a slightly lower MF and higher rebate. I walked the lot and found an inscription Black over Amber... gorgeous. I asked her to have the boss quote both cars and see which leased better. She come back and said the Inscription was better. $534 / month $1294 OOP 36/10. I didn't persue much further since I wasn't quite ready to pull the trigger but those #s wouldn't get it done! ($43,000 sell price including 4K incentive)

Just for giggles I asked what loaners they had. ""We don't have any for sale"". ??? I said your website shows several. She gets up and goes back to the boss and comes back with , oh yes we can lease those. I ask for a price on a T5 Inscription with a $46K sticker and 3000 miles. They come back with $474 / $1000 OOP. If that one wasn't black interior I may have started digging in a bit, but with the seemingly lack of interest on the sales person's part and also the lack of knowledge I grew tired of trying keep the dialogue open.

I think I'm going to look at what some other dealers have and see about shooting off some emails then go back to the local dealer and see what I can do.

On the $49K T6 we may be too far apart to strike a deal, but if the right loaner pops up. Maybe."
1908	August 13, 2019 12:39PM	nyccarguy	@tjc78 - what's the buyout on your Elantra when the lease is up?
1909	August 13, 2019 1:02PM	graphicguy	"Make sure you “get on it”. It’s a sweetheart of a motor that LOVES to rev....probably one of the smoothest engines I’ve experienced. You’ll feel a “kick” right around 3.5K-4K RPMs as the VTEC does its thing.

Give it some “go” coming through turns and you’ll feel the SH AWD do what it does.

Love to hear your impressions."
1910	August 13, 2019 1:04PM	stickguy	"If you find the right unit I think the loaner option is the best bet. Unless you want to LH it! There’s a dealer over in PA (out toward Lancaster I think) that I believe sometimes has killer prices.

I’m surprised about your experience. Usually all their salespeople are very experienced, and most have been there a long time. I was friendly with the owner at one point but I think she might have retired from active duty.

And crazy thought, but for leasing, maybe you could get a comparable deal on an S90, factoring in incentives?"
1911	August 13, 2019 2:00PM	tjc78	"$13,500.... probably buried by a few thousand. It's only 2 payments left @ $210 so I'll just deal with it separately if I strike a deal soon.

I want to nail something down by mid-sept. October is a really crazy month for us with my daughter's birthday, anniversary and family birthdays so don't want to leave it until the end."
1912	August 13, 2019 2:06PM	tjc78	"@stickguy
Yes, I was pretty surprised. Everyone was nice and I just noticed I had a VM on my home phone from a different person so they are probably trying to move a unit. The salesperson was just too new I think.

The S90 doesn't have the incentives / program right now the 60 does.

Maybe I'll call them later just to see what they are offering....

I like being in a position having the time. I really want the additional discount of a loaner, but the one Inscription they had was a black interior. I really prefer a lighter color."
1913	August 13, 2019 2:07PM	tjc78	"This unit

1914	August 13, 2019 2:13PM	pensfan83	Oh yes. Toss the car into a corner, hit the gas, and let the AWD figure it out. I usually end up backing off before the car loses grip.
1915	August 13, 2019 2:33PM	stickguy	That’s nice. Agreed needs lighter interior. And I would much rather not have the 19s.
1916	August 13, 2019 8:17PM	tjc78	"Volvo dealer must have Googled my phone number and somehow work email address, I didn't provide either.

At any rate....They want to make a deal today OK.

So I gave some parameters and am letting them do their thing. I'm curious as to what they come back with.

Told her to quote the Red/Black demo and a new Inscription T6 in White, Black or Red with a light interior that they want to move

I'm certainly not jumping into anything, but this is the car I want.

To be continued"
1917	August 13, 2019 8:19PM	tjc78	"At least I have the LH deals to compare it to.

They have 46 new 2019 S60s...I'm sure they want to move some."
1918	August 13, 2019 8:25PM	carnaught	Nice car, but I agree with you and @stickguy about it’s black interior. It’s amusing that under “Inscription features” is Glovebox, Tailored Dashboard and Upholstery Color Matching Leather Key Fob.
1919	August 13, 2019 8:40PM	28firefighter	"I would strongly urge you to try and for a T6. You'll appreciate the extra power.

I heard the R-Design was leasing well, too. You're also in the right part of the country to make a deal on Volvo. Only bummer is you missed the $3000 costco offer back in June."
1920	August 13, 2019 9:18PM	ab348	Probably 44 of them with black interiors.
1921	August 13, 2019 9:37PM	breld	"@tjc78 - good luck with the S60 transaction!

So what were some of the strong selling points for you on the Volvo versus other choices?"
1922	August 13, 2019 10:16PM	greg128	I have the 3.6L 310 HP version in the 2018 Lacrosse and it is a gem. Smooth, plenty of power and on a recent highway trip had 41 MPG best 25 mile reading with AC on traveling 70-75MPH...and on 87 octane.
1923	August 13, 2019 10:32PM	28firefighter	"I just left some very strong feedback with BMWNA. Received a letter today on the X1 offering a ""pull ahead."" Problem is our X1, along with many others, are subject to this B-Pillar safety recall.

So, I asked the dealer how they were able to sell X1 if parts were unavailable and they deflected, but it sounds (to me) like BMW is fixing cars on the lot before issuing a remedy for customer cars. My only option if I wanted to avail myself of this offer would be to pay the remaining payments and return the car.

Seems like a not great message that you have a safety recall in place and are fixing the sale cars first, to move them. I'm sure there is more nuance to it, but on its face it looks non-ideal."
1924	August 13, 2019 11:22PM	tjc78	"No punch gentlemen.

Because I have time and the dealer kind of stalked me out I made a super aggressive offer they politely declined.

$49145 MSRP they offered 16% off yielding a $475 36/10 with $1300 OOP

I countered with an ambitious 20% discount which would have yielded a $425 payment with $1300 OOP

I didn’t think they would take it so the hunt continues. No worries I have two + months

@breld.
I really like the looks both inside and out and it’s just a comfy cruiser that handles well and is fairly quick"
1925	August 13, 2019 11:33PM	stickguy	"maybe they come back. seems fair at a ""split the difference and meet in the middle"" deal.

Heck of an upgrade over a base engine Elantra!

you should take a look at the TLX too. I bet you would like that too. Just make sure it has tech package."
1926	August 13, 2019 11:50PM	nyccarguy	Impressive. My Infiniti could only average 41 mpg if I were driving next to a Prius and we averaged our MPG together.
1927	August 13, 2019 11:51PM	cdnpinhead	Yeah, but at least it's naturally aspirated -- and not listed earlier on those that are.
1928	August 14, 2019 1:10AM	kyfdx	Or, if the Prius was pushing you...
1929	August 14, 2019 1:45AM	sda	I noticed the Volvo had the upgraded audio, nice. A couple of days ago I was curious and looked up the Bang & Olufsen company to find out more about them. Little did I know Harman was gobbled up by Samsung. Samsung now owns many recognized audio names like Harman, Levinson, B&O, and many others. Not sure that is a good thing.
1930	August 14, 2019 2:11AM	corvette	"In the early 2000s, my parents needed a new audio receiver for their home theater, and, at my recommendation, bought a Harmon Kardon. Shortly after the warranty was up, it began randomly locking up and had to have the power cable unplugged in order to reset it. They were extremely patient with it and seemed content to put up with it. I, however, was not, and even though I only experienced the problem once or twice a month when I visited, got them a new Sony receiver for a birthday / Father's Day / Mother's Day (not sure which).

I have a compact Yamaha receiver with separate speakers/subwoofer and it's been fine for several years. I'd probably just get a soundbar and ditch the speakers if I needed to replace it."
1931	August 14, 2019 2:23AM	marcogallo1986	@&;@TJC oh man, I was hoping to hear a story I got your new ride or you love so much hang in there, you never know they might call you back tomorrow, or the next couple of days you’ll get the car that you want, any other potential prospects they like. day
1932	August 14, 2019 2:35AM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 firefighter, I can’t wait to hear what you think of the Acura going to test drive tomorrow Wednesday.
1933	August 14, 2019 2:35AM	marcogallo1986	@ stick guy, glad you’re getting the wife closer and closer to getting a new ride for herself.
1934	August 14, 2019 3:36AM	roadburner	Next week I'll be in northern KY for a meeting. I may leave early and look at a 2019 370Z NISMO; it's a Nissan corporate vehicle. My wife really likes it but it's an automatic, which I think just doesn't suit a Z Car. Plus, I suspect it can't match a ZF 8HP. Oh well, can't hurt to look. I keep hoping an aggressively priced CPO M2 will turn up, but that's an extreme long shot.
1935	August 14, 2019 12:13PM	ab348	Hmm, I did not know this. Those are some pretty impressive brand names. Depending on how far Samsung has infiltrated their design, manufacturing and R&D, it may or may not be a bad thing. But my experience with Samsung products has not been stellar. Of course, I have had even more problems with Sony products, so who knows...
1936	August 14, 2019 1:45PM	au1994	I'm sure you haven't heard the last of them. You're realistically not that far apart, its getting late in the model year and late in the month.
1937	August 14, 2019 2:00PM	tjc78	"We will see. I’m honestly not worried.

For kicks I also reached out to a broker on LH to see if his deal is worth the fee

I usually wait too long and don’t have the luxury of time. It’s nice not to be rush. I’ve really researched the heck out of the cars in this class.

I’d certainly take the Q40 at the right price but the Volvo is what I like the best. I know everyone is saying TLX. It’s a nice machine. I drove my buddies, but it’s not screaming buy me.

If only I had a crystal ball to see what the Sept programs are. If I don’t pull the trigger by 8/30 it may be worth a shot to get a Costco membership if they bring that back for Sept."
1938	August 14, 2019 2:02PM	au1994	A basic Costco membership is $60. If they bring back that program, you can't beat the ROI.
1939	August 14, 2019 2:10PM	stickguy	I thought you needed the membership for some period of time first? Like before the program gets announced?
1940	August 14, 2019 2:20PM	tjc78	Pretty sure as long as you have it the previous month it is good
1941	August 14, 2019 2:27PM	tjc78	Edit. I think it’s two months based on some research. So for Sept it would need to be 7/31
1942	August 14, 2019 2:39PM	ab348	Even if not you can't beat the deals on boxcar-sized packages of toilet paper!!
1943	August 14, 2019 2:42PM	suydam	I don’t think so. We had just got our Costco membership when we leased the Volt. What a great program!

I always get myself into trouble like that on Facebook ha ha Ha
1955	August 14, 2019 9:31PM	greg128	That figure is according to the onboard trip computer...it might not be accurate, In thew computer memory the best 25 mile MPG reading was 43 ( I bought it used). It is probably off but the cart does seem to get really great mileage even around town. The 3.6L LGX motor has stop-start and cylinder deactivation. I will be going on a trip at the end of the month and will compute the actual MPG. If it is getting anywhere near that reading I would still be very happy. Overall very impressed with the Lacrosse. It took me a week after getting it to ensure that all features on the car actually work. I had to do research to find that it does not have front parking sensors...only rear. They are not standard even on the premium model and only availble with the driver confidence package 2 along with auto parking and adaptive cruise, which I found hard to believe as our previous Malibu premier had front sensors.
1956	August 15, 2019 12:22AM	28firefighter	"Well. The test drive experience was a total dud. Absolutely awful experience.

I made this appointment well in advance in the middle of the week. They confirmed 4 times. On arrival, it was my sales guy’s day off. They gave me to someone else. He was with a customer. So they bounced me to some new guy who was furious the entire time that I was dumped on him. Knew nothing about the car and had no interest in sharing any details. Was only interested in if I was buying today, which I was not.

The test drive loop was all of 1 mile in a perfect square. No mix of roads, no highway. When he asked if he could earn my business, I genuinely said that after a one mile test drive, absolutely not. He said it was all he was authorized to do.

The sales manager came out and asked me what else I was looking at. I told him. He proceeded to trash every one of them and told me I was crazy for considering them. I asked him if he was buying the car for me, or if it was my money.

In hindsight they absolutely judged me as a stroke. I was in jeans and a polo and driving the Viggen. Even though I told them I had an X1 lease ending and was looking at a BMW 440 among other cars.

I’ll share my limited thoughts on the car later. I’m so beyond frustrated."
1957	August 15, 2019 12:50AM	tjc78	"That really stinks @28firefighter. An experience like that can really sour you on the brand.

In reality not too much different than my Volvo experience the other night.

For those of you following the Volvo quest.

I emailed some larger dealers in North Jersey. I can not get a dealer to get me to the 20% discount I need to hit 440-450 with just first payment OOP.

Best I can do right now is at a dealer that has 80 2019 S60s in stock.

MSRP 49,990 - $475 with $475 OOP 36/10. Since I’ve been crunching the numbers like crazy at this point I didn’t get a worksheet but the selling price is $40,700 or 18.6%. Buy rate MF and 57%.

Thoughts?"
1958	August 15, 2019 12:52AM	28firefighter	"Did you try Prestige?

Also I’d reach out to some of the brokers from leasehackr."
1959	August 15, 2019 12:53AM	suydam	What an awful business that is! Is there another dealer nearby? Twice when Imade driving appointments back when I was looking the dealers acted like I was a walk-in. So frustrating. The first time I drove the Volt they hadn’t even bothered to charge it so it was in gas mode the whole time. Oddly when I went back a few months later, I had a totally different experience.
1960	August 15, 2019 12:57AM	pensfan83	I'd consider another dealer altogether, that's pretty inexcusable. And I cannot stand it when sales people from any walk of life who trash their competitors rather than sell me on why their offering is superior.

1970	August 15, 2019 2:04AM	28firefighter	"Ok. So the car.

Aesthetically, I love the look of the TLX A-Spec. Everything about it, really. If I had to quibble, it would be the fake 4” dual exhausts which, if you look inside, are just covering a normal exhaust. Nothing more or less. I love how it looks, especially the white example I drove.

The interior of the car is outstanding. The seats are some of the best I’ve ever sat in - you could put serious time in them and be very comfortable (In seattle that means covering 5 miles in an hour because of traffic). The car has lots of soft touch plastic and stitched surfaces and overall feels very upscale. I especially enjoyed the the auto climate controlled seats that were both heated and cooled. The sound system is outstanding as well, which we already knew. Navigation screen is outdated and looks almost exactly like the Acura Nav from 6 years ago. Not a big deal since you have carplay. I also happened to be a fan if the dual screen setup though I’m a bit confused as to why carplay shows on the big screen when it’d be better with a touchscreen experience.

The drive. Now as I said, I did not get a long test drive and it was only on fairly busy surface streets. I did drive it in Sport+. The car handling with the AWD is very fun - it’s well planted and even taking turns at speed, it just pulls you through. Steering is also very good with excellent feedback and a nice weight to it. Engine has a nice growl to it. The car feels like it wants to be fast, with the HP and TQ? but the transmission feels like it is holding it back. Even holding the gears longer in Sport+, it just felt like it was hunting all the time. When it did shift it was harsh. Maybe it’s just this car, but it felt like with either a dual clutch or, *gasp*, a CVT the car would be in its sweet spot more often. I did not get a chance to see VTEC in action - just wasn’t safe.

I got back in the 17 year old Viggen with a throttle body that’s on its way out and felt like this just wasn’t the right fit for me. The look and feel are important, but if the drive isn’t doing it for me, then it’s not worth it.

I can absolutely see why those here love their TLX. It does A LOT of things right."
1971	August 15, 2019 2:25AM	roadburner	"How unprofessional. When I was working at BMW if someone asked me how BMW compared to a competitor I'd always say that there were no bad cars in that market segment, but each manufacturer emphasized different things, and then I'd go on to say what I thought BMWs did well without trashing other brands.

I also never qualified a customer by the way that they dressed. Some wealthy people deliberately dress down to see how they will be treated. And anyway, why not be gracious to everyone? Even f they can't afford a new or used BMW today they may well be able to in the future."
1972	August 15, 2019 3:16AM	stickguy	did it have the leather seats or the alcantara surface ones?

1977	August 15, 2019 9:13AM	tjc78	I’m shooting for a 20% off looser deal, no dealer is playing ball with a trade.
1978	August 15, 2019 9:50AM	benjaminh	"Was this Acura of Seattle or a different place? Since your test drive was so short maybe it's worth it to find a different dealer that'll let you really drive it?

The 4-cylinder TLX probably isn't fast enough for you, but the Acura-built 8-speed dual-clutch transmission with unique torque-converter is a good transmission that has a nice shift quality. You should put it in ""Sport"" or ""Sport+"" if you test drive it. Here's Acura's 2-minute promo video on the 4-cylinder engine and 8-speed DCT combo from the introduction of the car c.5 years ago...."
1979	August 15, 2019 10:53AM	sda	I like your approach. Had I been your customer I would not in anyway been put on the defensive and would have appreciated your insight. I admit to initially being annoyed by pushback when I called, asked for a sales manager and when finally connected, explained I wanted to bring a car home for my wife to drive and return it immediately after. He immediately started to ask questions to financially qualify me before even entertaining my request. I pushed back, explained I had already driven the car, and was a multiple repeat customer. He relented and the rest of my experience was positive. But I just about said forget it.

1981	August 15, 2019 12:15PM	ab348	I never knew that Acura dumped the ZF automatic transmission in favor of a DCT. That is something I would have thought would have gotten more mention in the media.
1982	August 15, 2019 12:24PM	pensfan83	The V6 has the 9 speed ZF. The 4 cylinder has the 8 speed DCT
1983	August 15, 2019 12:51PM	marcogallo1986	@28FF thanks for your impressions on your test drive, hey if you don’t like it onto the next one. What a horrible experience you had with the sales people and staff at that dealer I would’ve gave them the same responses you did. I’ve done that in the past when looking at you stuff they wouldn’t tell me the price so I said stop playing games and get all nasty with them sometimes you have to do that and that’s not me ha ha.
1984	August 15, 2019 12:52PM	marcogallo1986	@QB Nice short list you have there.
1985	August 15, 2019 12:54PM	graphicguy	"@28firefighter .....that’s inexcusable for any dealer of any brand. I don’t blame you for being that upset. I wouldn’t want to do business with that dealer for any reason.

No way you could get a “feel” for any car after only driving it in a 1 mile test.

Shame, because they really are great cars.

In Sport Plus, the trans tries to mimic what a manual would feel like if you were shifting gears. Kinda hokey. I usually stay in Sport, which smooths things out significantly without giving up the performance. The V6 will run...and will pull....hard....it’s very smooth, too.

Again, a brief test drive just won’t do the car justice. I think I’d call the GM of the dealership and let him know how you were treated."

1990	August 15, 2019 1:33PM	pensfan83	Our dog is not in the TLX unless the seat cover is in place. Did that once and will never do it again.
1991	August 15, 2019 1:44PM	stickguy	I had the seat cover on. But his hair can infiltrate Fort Knox I think. At least on the black seats and carpet, it’s easy to find!
1992	August 15, 2019 2:19PM	suydam	I have a lab mix. That’s why I like leather seats. We also had one “dog free” car but recently have had to relax that rule. Even with a ramp she can no longer get into the Encore.
1993	August 15, 2019 2:56PM	28firefighter	"Your point is taken. I should have known better than to go to this place - I have a friend who is an Acura fanatic and warned me they were a mess. He still goes there, but complains every time. Said he has written to the GM before and they made no effort to make things right.

The issue is, the next closest Acura dealers are going to be an hour + away with traffic. I don't mind that when I'm ready to buy, but for a test drive its a schlep. Plus, since I'd have to service at this dealer, I'm not particularly excited about needing to give them any business.

I have no doubt that it is a great car and with a longer test drive I could probably be sold on it - but the dealer has really soured the experience."

1995	August 15, 2019 3:39PM	pensfan83	Fly to Pittsburgh and you can drive mine from the airport to Oakland for some O fries and a stop in the bookstore. You get highway, city, and gridlock all in one test drive

I badly need a trip back to Pittsburgh."
1997	August 15, 2019 3:53PM	stickguy	One good thing about the TLX. Assuming you don’t put a lot of miles on it, service is 1x a year, through the express oil change lane!
1998	August 15, 2019 4:18PM	28firefighter	"I have some time scheduled to go drive an Accord 2.0T 6spd this afternoon. They have one in stock that just came in, so a sales rep I know reached out and strongly suggested I come take it for a spin.

Who can resist? Besides, the dealer experience could not possibly be any worse."
1999	August 15, 2019 4:26PM	pensfan83	"Mine was in for service this morning. State inspection, synthetic oil change, tire rotation, and a rear differential fluid change for $210.

I also have 6 32nds left on the tires so it's likely I'll have to do something before next September. I'm thinking of getting a used set now and remounting the original tires near less turn in."

If only you could buy a car directly from a manufacturer..."
2001	August 15, 2019 4:32PM	stickguy	with the rain, traffic and hills in Seattle, I imagine stick shifts are pretty rare to have in stock.
2002	August 15, 2019 4:35PM	stickguy	"I have some fluids due next service (60K, even though I might only be at about 57-58, so could push it) for the RDX. I think rear diff and transmission. I did center diff last time I think. Darned AWD costs more to maintain. I am pretty sure if I had gotten FWD I would not have really noticed the difference.

For the tires, unless the used ones are better quality, why bother? Use up what you got. If it doesn't pass turn in inspection next year, get the used tires then."

2005	August 15, 2019 4:39PM	28firefighter	"My experience with the Accord 1.5 or 2.0 manuals are that they are rare because they're lower production volume in general. Most of the Jetta GLIs up this way are manual, actually - way more than I would have expected.

Most of my driving is against and across traffic during the week (since S only goes to school 10-15 minutes away from here) and we have the Subaru for our longer family jaunts on the weekend."

2009	August 15, 2019 4:51PM	tifighter	"The funny thing about the Tesla sales experience (aside from no franchised dealers and sales commission shenanigans) is that the store staff seems to come from outside auto sales altogether. When I was looking and asking questions, one person used to work for an Apple store, one did come from a car rental company. Another from a wireless provider. They knew the product just fine, but none of them would have known what the terms ""greenpea"",""mini"",""mop and glo"",""stroke"" or ""extended service contract"" meant."

2012	August 15, 2019 5:08PM	corvette	I think the manufacturers are mostly glad not to have the burden of operating a dealership. That way, any time something goes awry, they can just say that each dealership is independently owned and operated.
2013	August 15, 2019 5:10PM	corvette	What exactly are O fries?
2014	August 15, 2019 5:18PM	tifighter	"As for the 3, it will be one year next month since we picked it up. It is my wife's car now; she prefers the size for parking at her work garage. For this same reason, its the car we mostly use around town together. The 3 is a winner. It is really fun to drive - handles well, comfortable, instant power, great sight lines, good seats. My wife likes the glass roof. Best infotainment out there bar none; I went from having Carplay to not and do not miss it at all. Surprisingly good stereo (better than the X I think). Both cars have been on a few road trips now. Charging coverage here is good, and autopilot makes long trips very nice. I took the X over to eastern Washington last weekend for a long weekend, and even way out in the Palouse (you Washington guys will know where that is) I had a surprising number of charging options.

The only issues we've had are small - my wife's phone seems slow to pair with the 3 although I have no issues with mine. The autopark system seems to work when it wants to, sometimes it will ID a space when you aren't looking for one, and other times it is napping when you want to use it. It's a known issue, even Elon said on twitter that they are working on it for an upcoming software update. (OTA software updates are great BTW) The ginormous windshield on the X is awesome, but will warm up the car when it's hot out - fortunately the A/C can keep up.

Electric may not work for everyone (though you might be surprised), but as this is CCBA, everyone here should test drive the 3 for fun. The stores are low/no pressure and won't pester you. It is a fun car to drive."
2015	August 15, 2019 5:23PM	nyccarguy	Can't believe you've had it almost a year already! How many miles?
2016	August 15, 2019 5:30PM	fintail	3 is the only Tesla I'd want, maybe if/when my building gets charging infrastructure, and maybe the design might even evolve a little, too. I think it wears the design language best. Make mine a loaded model in blue. X and S don't warm me up, and too many I see around the eastside are irksome via driving and driver.
2017	August 15, 2019 5:33PM	tifighter	Around 8k miles. My wife and I live about 3 miles from our respective offices, so the miles only really pile up on weekends.
2018	August 15, 2019 6:02PM	qbrozen	On that Challenger, I’m thinking new might be a better deal, if I am reading the incentives correctly. If bonus cash and IDL incentives stack, it would be $9750-$10250 off. Combined with just 7.5-8% discount, I’d be looking at just over $31k on a $44k build. Yes, that’s a lease, but I’d take the bonus discount and then buy out the lease a few mos later. All big IFs.

2020	August 15, 2019 6:43PM	benjaminh	The Tesla Model 3 performance can go 0-60 in less than 4 seconds, which is faster than a Genesis G70 with the optional 6-cylinder turbo.

2022	August 15, 2019 6:44PM	stickguy	How’s the mid range acceleration on the Tesla? Say, 40-80? Just as fast?
2023	August 15, 2019 6:49PM	tifighter	"Seems fast to me. Your post made me go try to find a number from a review somewhere. Here's a quote from Car and Driver on the P3-

""This Model 3 needed only 1.4 seconds to leap from 30 to 50 mph and just 2.0 seconds to get from 50 to 70. Never mind other sports sedans—they're not competitive by this measure. This Tesla's mid-range acceleration tops the performance of 700-hp sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 and Porsche 911 GT2 RS, in which there's a moment's delay while automatic transmissions downshift and engines rev up. And the Tesla does it without drama beyond the alarming way it pushes you back into the seat as the car closes on any traffic ahead."""
2024	August 15, 2019 6:56PM	stickguy	sounds good. I know the G70 will do the same thing if you floor it, since I did it last weekend!
2025	August 15, 2019 7:07PM	benjaminh	Even the standard range Model 3 Tesla goes 0-60 in c.5.5 seconds, which is very fast, esp. since my Acura TLX 4-cylinder at c.6.8 seconds seems fast enough to me. What more interests me about the Tesla are the operation costs and the long-term durability. In terms of gas vs. electricity you save c. $1000 a year with a Tesla if you drive c.12k miles a year, and it seems like long-term ownership costs are going to be very low in terms of maintenance and repairs with the Model 3 even compared to a reliable gas engine.
2026	August 15, 2019 7:11PM	jmonroe1	"'O' fries are french fries that are sold at the Original Hot Dog shop that is located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh which is where the Pitt Campus is. No one in these parts calls the place by it's official name, it is simply the 'O'. In fact if you asked someone from around here, ""where is the Original Hot Dog shop"", they'd probably look at you like you had two heads. The shop has been there since the mid 50's if IIRC. They have damn good dogs but their fries are the best I have ever had. If you ever make a trip to the Burgh it is well worth it to go there for both fries and dogs. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Just be sure you ask for directions to the 'O'.

Just imagine if one were to drive (oh I don't know) say 20,000 miles per year and their current vehicle guzzled down PUG at a rate of around 20 mpg."
2030	August 15, 2019 7:40PM	tifighter	"Conservatively, 20 miles would take about 5.7kWh of electricity driving a 3 (although my lifetime average is better than this). So compare your cost of PUG (x.xx/1 gal) vs electricity (x.xx* 5.7kWh).

Where I live PUG is showing 3.51/gal. My electricity rate is $0.08/kWh. So $3.51 vs $0.46 (0.08*5.7). Over 20000 miles, this is $3510 vs $460. Pretty good savings here in the PNW, but YMMV..."
2031	August 15, 2019 8:02PM	ab348	I could certainly see myself with an electric car, although charging infrastructure here is not at all good right now so that would need to improve. But I don't think I could bring myself to buy a Tesla for a bunch of reasons, mostly to do with Elon. I am astounded by how slowly the traditional manufacturers are getting into the electric game with viable competitors (there really aren't many). If they don't move soon they could get left behind like buggy-whip manufacturers. Yet they have the huge advantage of dealer networks and brand recognition. It's very odd to me.

2033	August 15, 2019 9:37PM	Michaell	"Hey all!

Just spent the last 6 days in sunny SoCal, watching my son get married. Great girl, great ceremony, great reception.

Car related events during my visit:

My rental was a white over grey Toyota Camry SE - 15,xxx miles on it. I put 200 miles on it, and found it to be comfortable and competent. One nit to pick is that the adaptive cruise control is a bit abrupt in braking, and the CC shuts off at some low speed, so I had to manually restart it. Not fun on the 405. 6.6 gallons to refill it, so right at 30 MPG.

Saw a pale yellow BMW 7-series in Malibu. Looked like a factory color (!).

Got mom's '03 Sonata to pass the smog inspection. Took it out the day before and gave it an ""Italian tune up""; lots of full throttle acceleration and got it up to 85 on a back road. Whatever it was, we solved the problem. There are a few things that I could see getting done - it pulls to the left pretty badly, and I suspect the tires may be in need of replacement based on time, not mileage. 38,xxx miles after almost 17 years. But, mom isn't driving any more and her caretaker (family friend) uses it to run mom's errands when necessary, so not a lot of miles.

The lease on my cousin's RX350 ended a few months back, and she replaced it with a CPO MB GLE350. Dark grey over black (in Bakersfield - wouldn't be my first choice!); nice car on the inside, and has the illuminated tri-star on the grille.

Here in Colorado, the Jetta goes back on Monday. The Outback gets service on Saturday, and apparently the windshield is cracked and will need to be replaced soon.

To answer the question posed earlier this week, the Outback gets 20-21 MPG in the city, and we've seen as high as 28MPG on the highway."

2039	August 15, 2019 11:26PM	andre1969	"Hey, everyone! Haven't checked in this particular chat in ages...how's everybody doing? Anyway, I'm soliciting advice. Not for me, but my uncle. Here's his situation...

Right now, he has a 2016 Chevy Colorado, extended cab, 4-cyl, 4wd. It's basically a 2-seater, despite that little fabric-clad package shelf and set of seatbelts in back. He's retired, and really doesn't drive a whole lot. He's had that truck since June 2016, and I think he only has around 18,000 miles on it. Anyway, he's got the itch for a car. He talks about wanting better gas mileage, keeping the miles off his truck, etc. I've tried telling him he doesn't drive enough for fuel economy, or racking up the miles, to be a concern. But then the truth came out...he says he doesn't like the idea of having something that can really only carry himself and one other passenger.

Well, he found a 2007 Lincoln Town Car at a local used car lot. It has about 93,000 miles on it, looks in good shape from the pics, and has a sunroof, so I'm guessing it's a pretty nice model...even though Town Cars weren't cheap when new, sunroofs weren't all that common. They want $5200 for it. I told him he should offer $4,000, and see what happens. Presuming, it's inspected, has a 90 day warranty at least, etc.

So, does that sound reasonable? It's not something that he absolutely needs, but he wants it. It's not going to get particularly good fuel economy. He doesn't keep track of mileage in his Colorado, but I have a feeling the Town Car would do worse. But, with the way he drives, it's not going to bankrupt him, either."
2040	August 15, 2019 11:29PM	stickguy	"found the twin to my car. CPO though, so some extra warranty. Pretty good discount from new, and low miles. Though if they have the same car leftover new might pay less, trading a few miles for 2 years BtoB warranty.

2042	August 16, 2019 12:32AM	xwesx	Missed my opportunity six months ago.
2043	August 16, 2019 12:38AM	xwesx	I probably cannot comment on $4K for this car as reasonable. Sounds like it to me, but then anything that age that is in full working order should be worth about that price. As far as mileage goes, I wouldn't be surprised at all if he does at least as well with the TC as he does with the Colorado. You wouldn't think it, but those panthers really weren't bad on fuel at all.
2044	August 16, 2019 12:45AM	tjc78	"4K is good deal for that car. 2007 was a good year for those. They still have the air suspension, drive by wire quirks were ironed out as well as the soft axles.

It should probably get plugs soon, and listen to it on startup to see if the timing guides/chain is noisy.

As you know they are sturdy and run well in excess of 200k

Gas mileage? Mine (04 Grand Marquis) got 17.5 with a 70hwy / 30 city split and my heavy foot."
2045	August 16, 2019 1:21AM	28firefighter	"Ok. The Accord Sport 2.0T.

The dealer experience was night and day better than Acura. It was actually fun. The sales guy and SM both came out fawning over the Viggen (SM has a 9-5 Wagon and just sold a 9000 CSE). They were super pumped to have an enthusiast looking at the Accord. It’s like a badge of honor. Could have been salesmanship, but it felt genuine and made me feel good so - kudos!

The car itself is really impressive for the money.

Aesthetically it reminds me a lot of my CC. Low coupe roof in the back, long, with a stubby front end. But I liked it and I really like it in White or the blue color they offer. It is LONG though and I do wonder if that would get annoying over time. My garage isn’t huge so I’d need to double check it.

The interior is pretty simple and plain, but well appointed with tons of soft touch plastic and leather wrapped surfaces. The seats are a heated leather cloth combo that felt very comfortable and supportive - not like the TLX but also 15k cheaper on paper. I love the infotainment system - it’s easy to use, responsive, and just all around a pleasure. The stereo is definitely meh but didn’t seem all that different from the beats audio in the GLI. The backseat has air vents and soft touch plastic and is like a studio apartment. No concerns about space whatsoever.

The drive was really very nice. It maybe wasn’t as fast as the GLI, but it was still quick. The shifter was nice and notchy with short throws. I actually liked this better than the GLI gearbox. The clutch was nicely weighted with a good spring action. Definitely took some getting used to because the engagement point is much higher than I’m used to. Steering was tight and responsive. The car I drove was a demo with 4K miles and it was tight as can be with no rattles (praise god) which is a complaint on the Jetta. The suspension was definitely softer than the GLI, but it was still more than nimble feeling for a car of its size.

I’d definitely be giving up some of the sportiness of the GLI and some of the tech (digital cockpit, DCC, cooled seats etc). But it just felt more well rounded and very solid. A good balance. They’re both priced comparably but I’d likely be able to get the GLI for a bit less.

It’s going to be a tough decision."
2046	August 16, 2019 1:43AM	xwesx	Nice write up! Also a great thing that these guys were able to give you a good experience (particularly so soon after your frustrations with Acura).
2047	August 16, 2019 1:54AM	corvette	Honda has traditionally done a crisper, less rubbery manual transmission than VW.
2048	August 16, 2019 2:39AM	jmonroe1	"Yep, you screwed up alright but the next time you're in town I bet you won't miss it that time.

jmonroe"
2049	August 16, 2019 2:54AM	stickguy	just make 100% sure you are OK with such a big car. Try it in the garage, and be objective, because (as I know all too well) if there is a fatal (or semi-fatal) flaw and you talk yourself into it anyway, you will likely regret it. Bad.
2050	August 16, 2019 3:14AM	28firefighter	Said the exact same thing tonight to my Dad. They’re both really compelling options. Just wish the interior of the GLI was a bit less plasticky.
2051	August 16, 2019 3:23AM	stickguy	biggest issue I had with the Accord is they made it too low (roof and seating position). Besides being pretty long, but I can deal with that easier.
2052	August 16, 2019 4:24AM	breld	"Nice write-up @28firefighter.

Did you get any idea that there could be some dealing on that 4K mile example?"
2053	August 16, 2019 5:00AM	28firefighter	"They had it advertised for $29k as certified. So I’d say no. Combined with it being a non-ideal color and being a few months too early, I left. They were totally respectful of that fact so I have no complaints. I’d be targeting 27-28k on a new unit, so I’d expect a demo to be $25k or less.

Something else I realized, the Sport doesn’t have memory seats. Doesn’t matter now but would if I can get my wife to drive it."
2054	August 16, 2019 9:30AM	benjaminh	"Would your wife really drive a manual?

I looked it up and the Accord is only about an inch longer and .3 of an inch wider than the TLX. As you say, the Acura ELS sound system is better than the top system in the Accord, and when it comes to the seats, the controls, and the rest of the interior the TLX is better imho. With the c.$9k in lease incentives on the 2019 TLXs from Acura I'd say the difference in price isn't 15k, but maybe closer to c.7k when compared to a TLX V-6 A-spec? In the unlikely event you'd consider a 4-cylinder TLX Tech the price then becomes pretty close to the same as an Accord Sport 2.0, and in fact I think the Acura has the price advantage by a couple of thousand—although the Accord 2.0 turbo is obviously faster and more powerful than the naturally aspirated 4-cylinder TLX."
2055	August 16, 2019 11:18AM	sb55	17 year old tires are ticking time bombs. You should switch them out sooner than later.
2056	August 16, 2019 12:02PM	tjc78	"Stunned:
Carvana offered 12,417 for the Elantra. Buyout is 13,492 so doing that math still cheaper for me just to keep it for a little while and pay two payments and dispo fee.

Autolenders offered 12,000 on their site, but when I sold them my Genesis they were able to negotiate a lower buyout with Hyundai Financial so I'm calling them later on.

Waiting for Vroom's offer.
Edit: Vroom = 10,000 which is more or less what I thought the others would be.

I could also run to Carmax at lunch if I can break away."
2057	August 16, 2019 1:01PM	stickguy	Probably not a smart idea, but I ran the RDX through carvana. $15,100. Definitely not expecting that. If the plan was to get rid of it when the wife got her new car, we would be out shopping this weekend. Certainly held value. I only paid $32 k 7 years ago, next month.
2058	August 16, 2019 1:36PM	nyccarguy	That's $15K in your pocket! Start shopping before that RDX depreciates anymore.
2059	August 16, 2019 2:19PM	graphicguy	Thanks for the impressions @28firefighter ...just what I was looking for.
2060	August 16, 2019 2:24PM	stickguy	"I ran the scheme plan past the wife (sell RDX, pay off rest of equity loan used to finance college, lease new for her, have monthly payments go way down, and put difference into a savings account to pay for car at end of lease). She was, well, less than receptive. Does not really want a lease (though I explained it would be a lease to buy). Plus, she figured if y'all people supported it, must be a bad plan!

next step, start stopping at a few dealers when we happen to be out and about, just to scope out options on the short list."
2061	August 16, 2019 2:43PM	28firefighter	"You make a point, @benjaminh. I was more comparing fit, finish, features on an Accord Sport vs. TLX A-Spec because they're in two different classes if you look at list price.

I may try and get out to Bellevue and drive one again, but the idea of needing to go to the dealership closest to me for service or warranty issues is downright bothersome."
2062	August 16, 2019 2:48PM	nyccarguy	What's your interest rate on the HELOC? Is it more than the money factor you'd be paying on a lease?
2063	August 16, 2019 2:49PM	benjaminh	I think the service department at your closer Acura dealer will be happy to service a TLX bought at another dealer. And maybe the service dept. doesn't have the issues that sales seems to have? Warranty work is unlikely on a Honda or Acura, but both Honda and Acura stand behind their vehicles no matter what dealer you go to in my experience. For instance, we got a better deal on our CR-V at a Honda dealer that's farther away from us, but we service it and get warranty work done at the Honda dealer closer to use. 0 issues. They are happy for the business.
2064	August 16, 2019 2:50PM	28firefighter	My point was more that I don't WANT to give them my business - warranty or otherwise. It was that poor of an experience.
2065	August 16, 2019 3:05PM	benjaminh	"Seems like overall the Accord works better for you anyway?

But if the TLX turned out to be better for you after another test drive, then imho driving to Bellevue a couple of times a year even for service seems like it would be worth it. My TLX is so fun for me to drive that honestly I think up excuses to drive more, and plan road trips I wouldn't have otherwise.

PS Since you own a BMW, I think that might qualify you for the additional $1250 loyalty/conquest lease incentive on the TLX V-6. Combined with the already existing lease incentive from Acura that's a big $10k off to start, plus you might be able to get another c. $3k or so off of msrp. And so with $13k off of the original msrp I think the price difference with the Accord 2.0 Sport is only maybe c. $4k or so?"
2066	August 16, 2019 3:06PM	stickguy	"28, I had a similar terrible experience at the Acura dealer close to me when shopping (really it was the particular salesguy I think, might have gone better if I had talked to SM directly). But, I swore them off for good. Even though it turned out that when I pivoted to a red A spec, they had 4 of them in stock!

but when I had my (defective) battery go bad 2 months later, they were the closest dealer to take it in to. Service experience, night and day. They were phenomenal. I use the other local dealer (a little further away) for the RDX but plan to take the TLX back to this place since they already have it on file, and it is a little more convenient."
2067	August 16, 2019 3:08PM	stickguy	"it's adjustable (a line, not a loan) so not sure but I think about 4%, so probably more than a lease MF. So technically I would save on interest doing this. and seriously improve cash flow! Or more accurately, instead of putting money into savings by paying off the HELOC, I would be putting it into an account.

mostly it was a scheme to see if I could get the wife to bite! And was nice to know the RDX was seriously holding its resale value."
2068	August 16, 2019 3:14PM	28firefighter	That is insane resale on the RDX. Good golly.
2069	August 16, 2019 3:16PM	stickguy	"well,, Carvana sometimes is your friend. I suspect if I went to a dealer today and tried to trade it in the offer is coming in way low.

that purchase means they plan to sell it for 18k. It's nice and miles are good, but still, seems high to me."
2070	August 16, 2019 3:23PM	ab348	I would run to Carvana to take that offer. It's a 7 year old vehicle! You should carefully consider all aspects of your options - pay off HELOC, use it as a down on a new vehicle, whatever - but I think this is a sign that it is time to make a move.
2071	August 16, 2019 3:31PM	corvette	Same reason I sold the Mustang to them - I was indifferent about keeping it and I knew I’d never get that much from any other dealer.
2072	August 16, 2019 3:36PM	tjc78	"@stickguy
It's time. Start shopping... If you want a Volvo I know most of the tri state dealers on a first name basis right now."
2073	August 16, 2019 3:41PM	28firefighter	I think I need to agree with everyone here, not just as an enabler. I would take that offer before they come to their senses...
2074	August 16, 2019 3:42PM	stickguy	"it is a good value. but, whatever replaces it (if we made a move now) is likely to depreciate harder in the next couple of years. And it only makes sense to do it if leasing, which we are not planning to do for the next family car (a lease to buy out is always a possibility, but can be a tough sell to ""the boss""). If we traded it in on a buy, then we end up with another big payment that we don't want.

Plus of course, there is the concept of keeping it around as the 2nd car after my lease goes away.

it would be nice of course if I got the quote because it was actually the right time to be making a move and it was going anyway!"
2075	August 16, 2019 3:43PM	stickguy	I do too from one search or another. Any chance there are amazing lease deals on an XC60 loaner? Probably not, because buying one for $40k still leaves a big gap after the trade in!
2076	August 16, 2019 3:53PM	Davercee	"""Probably not, because buying one for $40k still leaves a big gap after the trade in!""

Those are words of advice, right there."
2077	August 16, 2019 4:02PM	benjaminh	"You might mention to her that sometimes incentives are available for leases that aren't available for purchases, which as you know makes the ""lease to buy option"" the better deal."
2078	August 16, 2019 4:03PM	pensfan83	I'll also back everyone else and say you should strike while the iron is hot.
2079	August 16, 2019 4:05PM	ab348	Especially since its the end of the model year and incentives are likely reaching their peak level.
2080	August 16, 2019 4:10PM	stickguy	"out of curiosity I checked cars.com. based on miles, price is pretty reasonable, compared to the ones listed. Maybe a bit strong, but not too much.

a more cost effective option would be to split the difference, and get something like the Q5 that (SDA?) just bought, a 2016. Still a nice upgrade, and would tide her over for 2 years, then when the TLX goes back I just inherit that instead, but get something fancier than a 10 YO RDX. If I could find the right option, that plan, could have legs. Might need a couple drinks over dinner before springing that one on her."
2081	August 16, 2019 4:14PM	tifighter	"Ok, I'm in too.

Stick, don't let us down, now..."
2082	August 16, 2019 4:29PM	stickguy	"just poked around. man, I love this one. the colors, equipment, etc. Would never convince the wife of course. But I think if it just showed up at home, she would quickly get used to it!

Carvana makes it way too easy. they already have the trade info, and my documents from the last time. A couple of clicks and about 5 minutes later, just have to wait for the truck to show up with it!

2083	August 16, 2019 4:51PM	28firefighter	I think you'd want it a little more loaded up. Premium Plus or bust.
2084	August 16, 2019 4:56PM	jmonroe1	"Man, I don't know how you can pass up that car. I'm going to be an enabler and say you better hurry up. Like their add says, ""they are getting it ready for you"". So you gotta make sure that is YOU and not someone like @breld.

2085	August 16, 2019 5:03PM	ab348	Plus blue with black interior is not a combo that I would care for, but that's just me.
2086	August 16, 2019 5:25PM	xwesx	Absolutely! And, on that car, new tires are going to be satisfyingly cheap (probably about $350 for a decent set, installed).
2087	August 16, 2019 5:25PM	Michaell	Sorry that I didn't make this clear. The current tires on the Sonata are in fact the third set the car has had.
2088	August 16, 2019 5:27PM	xwesx	Damn; that woman is one sharp cookie!
2089	August 16, 2019 5:31PM	xwesx	"Similar on our Forester, TBH. I paid $23,000 for it in September of 2009. When it was totalled in March of 2017, with 108,500 miles, value was $12,000.

It is really nice when they hold value like that."
2090	August 16, 2019 5:48PM	breld	"Agreed. That's as plain-jane as you can get. Carvana offers up the original window sticker - if you haven't pulled that up yet (I just did), you'll see what we mean.

You'd be shocked at some of the features that aren't standard."
2091	August 16, 2019 5:49PM	breld	"I'll have my own Carvana experience this afternoon - GTI is scheduled to be dropped off (and Miata taken away) between 5:00 and 5:30 MST.

I'll report back."
2092	August 16, 2019 5:50PM	28firefighter	I've decided to take the afternoon off from work to try and recharge - haven't taken a true vacation day in 4 months (since Hawaii). What should I do? Any cars I haven't thought of I should try and sneak a test drive in?

2100	August 16, 2019 6:02PM	breld	"Not that I want to rush into anything (cause you know, that's not me), but with my older son getting his license and ferrying himself and his younger brother around to the seemingly endless baseball activities, not to mention school itself, the days of wanting/needing a 3 row SUV will be coming to an end before too long.

Given I still like the SUV body style, perhaps something like this could be a suitable replacement?

2104	August 16, 2019 6:09PM	tifighter	Tesla store in South Lake Union does a loop from there up to and around Greenlake. Then back down on either I5 or back down 99 depending on traffic.
2105	August 16, 2019 6:12PM	28firefighter	Good to know - was trying to avoid driving into the city. Just gave U Village a call to see if they have any openings.
2106	August 16, 2019 6:25PM	stickguy	"Thanks. Not sure what’s worse with an Audi. Old style/tech, or first year of a brand new design! I should go compare side to side. I have to go to dealer next week anyway, since my daughter is leaving her car for service.

Should stick with an X3. I know my wife won’t complain about that. She just hates Audi’s and VWs."
2107	August 16, 2019 6:34PM	28firefighter	"OK - so I'm going to try and get to a Genesis store, but they're not answering the phones, which is not promising. Tesla can't take me today except at 2:30 when I have to be home for a delivery, so that does not work. They made a point of saying that they only really allow drop-in test drives when people are looking to place an order in the near future.

Also someone asked if I was stuck on a stick - the answer is no, but I do think it will make it more likely I'll hang onto the car longer than if I don't. Plus, I think my window for buying a new car with a stick is dwindling rapidly."

2113	August 16, 2019 7:05PM	pensfan83	Having the fun car as a stick allows me to satisfy my desire to still do my own shifting w/o it being one of our main vehicles. That was one of two mandates for getting the Tacoma, no manual and any color but red or black.
2114	August 16, 2019 7:10PM	breld	Agreed. There was a time several years ago when we had 5 vehicles in the fleet and only one was an automatic (the minivan). Nowadays I am perfectly happy having the one manual for occasional rowing.
2115	August 16, 2019 7:12PM	stickguy	"My wife wouldn’t care about the stick in my car, as long as her car was nice and didn’t have one. She can still drive it in a pinch, and 99% of the time we are together, I drive. Especially when it’s my car.

She wants to get something nice and keep it a long time, which doesn’t work with leading. Plus I think likes the concept of owning it outright. But, if incentives were right, I could trot out the spreadsheet to show that a lease to buy was a better move. Or I just wouldn’t tell her."
2116	August 16, 2019 7:13PM	breld	"@stickguy - that Q5 is very nice. Premium and Tech packages should give you all you want. And the Utopia Blue is pretty.

As for the newly updated 2018 model, I've had plenty of seat time in the previous-gen Audi interiors (S4 and SQ5) and obviously with the current design in our A5 and Q7. No doubt I like the updated design, but I'd say the main drawbacks on the previous one would be the smaller screen (although not being a ""pop-up"" tablet style may be appealing) and the lack of carplay. If you can live with those two factors, nothing really wrong with the previous design."
2117	August 16, 2019 7:14PM	tifighter	Meh, they probably say that to try to prevent joyrides, like from my neighbor's kid with his lowered Mitsubishi. You are shopping the competition, so that makes you a potential customer/order placer.
2118	August 16, 2019 7:14PM	stickguy	I drove it about 30 miles last weekend. It got a good workout. But other than the ridiculous power, I kinda liked driving mine better. The G70 is a little tidier size though.
2119	August 16, 2019 7:16PM	breld	"I have yet to see a G70 in the wild here.

They need upscale stand-alone dealerships badly."
2120	August 16, 2019 7:22PM	stickguy	Just happened to get a mailing list email from Acura dealer. Pushing that they are offering leases on CPO models. Seems to defeat the purpose of CPO (the warranty), unless you wanted to buy it at the end. Would of course, work for me. Sadly no RDXs in the pool!
2121	August 16, 2019 7:35PM	Michaell	if it's not too late, I'll second that. I tested the GTR and liked it.

2123	August 16, 2019 7:53PM	corvette	10 years seem to be the absolute max cutoff on tire age recommendations. Some manufacturers recommend replacement at 6.
2124	August 16, 2019 7:56PM	corvette	+1 - 2018 is the second generation. Very subtle exterior changes, so you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a refresh. Interior gets a larger infotainment screen and CarPlay.

2128	August 16, 2019 10:32PM	28firefighter	"OK - so Tesla did not pan out. No time available today that they could take me out that worked for us. S is moving to a big boy bed tonight and it was being delivered today.

I tried to go to Genesis, but ironically, it was just a Hyundai dealer and they did not have any Genesis vehicles on site. In fact, they seemed baffled I knew they had Genesis until I pointed out the GIGANTIC sign along the road. Genesis has got to get their stuff together - reminds me of Alfa Romeo in some ways.

Ended up at the Audi dealer and took a look at (but did not drive) a 2017 Audi A4 Prestige with 20k miles in blue over nougat brown interior. Was listed for $33k but not certified because there is a safety recall. I really liked this one - was way more loaded than I would want personally, but felt very nice and upscale. Given the original 55k MSRP on it, I would expect it to feel substantially nicer than the GLI or Accord.

The more I look at and drive, the more analysis paralysis I get. I'm just trying to avoid a situation where I'm bored in 3 months."
2129	August 16, 2019 10:44PM	sda	That is equipped virtually identical to our ‘16. Though the infotainment screen is smaller than the ‘18, the images are very crisp and nicely displayed. The B&O audio sounds great. I’ve been impressed by how much less road noise compared to our Hondas and virtually no wind noise at all speeds. Though not Lexus quiet, it is quiet. It handles crisply and has good power. Still learning all the features and settings that can be utilized. Gas mileage has been around 22-23mpg heavy traffic. It feels solid, no rattles or squeaks. We are very pleased with it.
2130	August 16, 2019 10:55PM	breld	"@28firefighter - I actually was going to suggest a CPO current gen A4. They’re sort of a sleeper car but a very nice balance of sport and luxury.

I enjoy driving the wife’s A5, which obviously is pretty much the same thing."
2131	August 16, 2019 10:55PM	Michaell	@breld - while you won't need to cart the boys around on a regular basis, won't you still travel together as a family enough to keep the Q7?
2132	August 16, 2019 11:32PM	tjc78	Punch pending ....details tomorrow.
2133	August 16, 2019 11:54PM	suydam	Do you need to seat 5 in back or is a 4 seater enough? I love my Honda Accord but ultimately found it just too large. The Volt is the perfect size for me and I love its nimble handling. It sounds like you want something a little smaller than the Accord, otherwise you were very positive about it.
2134	August 17, 2019 12:01AM	stickguy	"Can't wait for the details Tom!

I was being good, settled into just waiting out my lease, but not I got the ""want a new car shakes"" bad. But, can't do anything without having the Wife look at them first.

I really just need to get her something new that she loves and will keep for a long time, then I can wheel and deal with my car as much as I want, and she won't care (since I won't go crazy with the money).

I sent her some links to RDXs. Only feedback was about colors. nothing about not wanting one! that or an X3 would probably be the 2 most suitable options for her, though really should be fine with something like a higher trim level RAV4!"
2135	August 17, 2019 12:06AM	breld	The carvana experience was really nice. The car was freshly detailed and the folks were very courteous and knowledgeable. I honestly expected a more impersonal car delivery experience, like when you have a shipper drop your car off. But seems to me they’ve put a lot of thought into the experience.
2136	August 17, 2019 12:08AM	28firefighter	Pictures?!
2137	August 17, 2019 12:08AM	suydam	@stickguy keep it simple. The more choices you throw in the less your chances of success. Your very first post on this issue made the most sense. Take advantage of the good offer, and lease a new version to buy. Easy peasy.
2138	August 17, 2019 12:09AM	breld	And of course, the whole reason we pulled the trigger on this one...

gotta have those seats. I would take that one off your hands."
2142	August 17, 2019 12:13AM	stickguy	"one frustrating thing is that the RDX leases like crap. Well, did the last time I looked so probably still does.

even easier is getting a comparable offer from the dealer, and trading it in instead, and getting $1,000 sales tax credit!"
2143	August 17, 2019 12:14AM	sda	Looks really nice, love the plaid seats and manual. Get rid of the Carvana plates, stickers poste haste!

@stickguy - it is “dark iron blue” which is very much like the dark gray one we had a while back, but with a blue tint to it."
2145	August 17, 2019 12:17AM	stickguy	I need to look again, but if I found the perfect car on Carvana like you did, that would be super simple! Especially if they could just swap the registration and plates over.
2146	August 17, 2019 12:19AM	nyccarguy	"Mazel-Tov @breld

@stickguy it's an easy fix but I would have rather they just remove it from the bill and not tell me they did it if it didn't need done. The only way I know is because the rim with the scratch is mounted in the same place as before so no real way to prove anything. I'm inclined to just ask the shop we use for tires whether it needs done. More of an annoyance than anything."

2158	August 17, 2019 1:52AM	28firefighter	It’s probably a typo by the dealer.

2160	August 17, 2019 2:04AM	stickguy	well, you have the truck and they don't want it back, so the incentive is really for them to resolve the situation. Not likely it has anything to do with credit approval, so probably just a paperwork snafu by the dealer.
2161	August 17, 2019 2:04AM	roadburner	A friend of mine who has written for several of the big car magazines told me that I shouldn't write off the Mustang Bullitt just because it doesn't have the MagneRide suspension- so I might take a look at it tomorrow.
2162	August 17, 2019 2:04AM	nyccarguy	@28firefighter - how about a Challenger with a 6-Speed? It’s not your typical torture chamber back seat coupe. There’s room to spare back there and Sam should be forward facing before you know it!

At lunch an M550i and a Challenger SRT Hellcat Widebody were being inspected. One of the deputies told the 5er owner I was a BMW expert(ha ha) so I spent a few minutes answering the new owner's questions. I knew the guy who bought the SRT and frankly, I was envious. It was gorgeous- the twin of this car:
2171	August 17, 2019 2:49PM	benjaminh	The VW Arteon has a 268 horsepower 2-liter turbo. It looks like a 4-door sedan, but it's also a hatchback that has almost as much cargo space as some compact SUVs. 4-wheel drive. Luxury interior. Kind of a freak, but I kind of like it. Starts at c. $35k. Here's a mostly positive review from Edmunds....
2172	August 17, 2019 2:58PM	sda	I like the Arteon and it reminds me a bit of the 06 Passat 2.0t that I had which was the basis for the CC. The pricing on the Arteon is ambitious, especially the higher line models. With everyone wanting a CUV/SUV I doubt they’ll sell many and depreciation has to be high which will make it an attractive used car buy.

2174	August 17, 2019 3:04PM	fintail	When I had a rental Challenger Scat Pack last year, the sound was indeed memorable. I felt either too old or too young for the car, as it turned the heads of 14 year olds and 64 year olds, but the noise is timeless.
2175	August 17, 2019 3:33PM	xwesx	"That is definitely one aspect that I love about the Q7: It is incredibly quiet! I don't necessarily appreciate this any longer after using it regularly, but when I move to one of the Foresters, or after not using it for a while, I get in and just subconsciously ""oooh"" and ""aaah"" the quietness and smoothness of the ride.

I drove it yesterday for the first time in two weeks so that a young military guy could take a look at it. He is ""PCS'ing"" soon as is strongly considering buying it before he drives out because he doesn't trust his current vehicle: a 2008 LR with about 150,000 miles on it. His hangup with pulling the trigger? It doesn't have lane keeping assist. /facepalm"

I had to make about a 100 mile loop through lower PA and Delaware this morning, a combo of highway and back roads, and overall it returned 35mpg per the TC. Hard to argue with that. Super quiet too cruising along. And since I did not have the wife with me, got to exercise the speakers too. Quite the sound system in this.

Maybe I will end up buying it out. another reason to get my wife out of the RDX early!"

36/10 $412/month (tax included @ 7.75%)
$1077.71 out of pocket (had Loyalty credit of $1250 for cap cost reduction)

Long story short, I negotiated with 4 different dealers over four days all by phone/email. Finally locked it in late yesterday. Completed the credit app and first payment last night. Dealer called right when they were closing and said all was good and to come in at 10:30 today.

Arrived at 10:30 and was out by 10 after 12.

Not bad at all and they apologized I had to wait a bit.

I’m so impressed with this car. Quick, nice firm but compliant ride. Great seats and the mid level Harmon Kardon sound system blows away the Bose in the Enclave. Bonus ... wife loves the look too.

Ironically, @breld , @jpp75 and I were at the Volvo dealer this morning. I dropped off the Outback for service and they met up with me. They had a great looking V60 on the lot - blue with what looked like a Tartan interior. Very cool looking. The S60 is one handsome auto, for sure. Serious upgrade from the Hyundai.

I had a chance to drive the new GTI that @breld had delivered last night. I managed to stall it in the parking lot before I got the hang of the clutch. Even though it has 10k on it, it looks showroom fresh. The plaid seats with the updated tech is a great combo."

@marcogallo1986
It’s pearl white

@benjaminh
The MSRP was just shy of 50k. It has the heated rear seat package, but no advanced (auto-pilot) or B&W audio otherwise pretty well equipped.

Thursday night I had gotten down to what was rock bottom on this car $465 / $465 down 36/10.

Three other dealers ranged from $10 to $50 a month higher. This was about a 19% discount from sticker.

I spoke with a broker from LH and his deal was similar just on a higher MSRP car. @28firefighter and I even chatted over PM and he sent me some deals that were pretty awesome but when structuring the lease the same as mine came to the same payment once I added in the broker fee.

So Friday around noon my wife calls me and says “did you pull the trigger”

“No, it’s been a killer day in here and haven’t had time to call the guy”

I get out of a meeting at 3:00 or so and the dealer is calling me with another offer. Same car I just got but loaner for $422 / month. Wow, I’m just about about ready to pull out the check book. He tells me the stock #, I look it up and it’s black over black. I just really dislike black interiors but with a black exterior it’s even worse.

So now I have a decision to make. I text my wife with the details and she basically said I’d never be happy with it and that if I’m getting this may as well get exactly what I want and not worry about the extra money in this case.

So that’s a wrap. I really never considered any Volvo’s until last year when I had a rental S90. As I drive it more I’ll let you guys know more of what I think of it.

Also.. the seats. Yes they are one of the best things about the car.

One more thing... yes I know nearly white interior with kids? They really won’t be in this one much. Come Sept I’ll have to take my daughter to school two days a week. Those two days I’ll take the Enclave and my wife will get some seat time in this (well all ten miles round trip)"
2230	August 18, 2019 11:50AM	qbrozen	T6 Inscription under $50k? Huh. Not sure I’ve seen that at my local dealers. Although I do only look at their loaner fleet.
2231	August 18, 2019 12:18PM	roadburner	"For those who don't check Cars and Conversations...
I took the M340i back today. I was reminded back in 1991 when I drove the then all new E36 325i. It was fast and fun, and when I got back behind the wheel of my 1987 535is it felt slow and ponderous. I was afraid that might happen again when I drove my M235i, but fortunately that was not the case. In fact, I still prefer the overall feel of the 2 Series. I'm sure it would be equally quick with the M Performance locking differential. Now, having said all that, there were a few things about the M340i that I liked better, but it was mostly down to some of the minor electronic features, such as the SiriusXM display, the layout of the home screen, and the glass cockpit.I'd also add that the M340i xDrive is one of only a few AWD cars that I could see owning as my ""fun"" car- the others being the M5, the X5M, the X3 M40i, and the STI."
2232	August 18, 2019 12:42PM	stickguy	"Tom, I had the same debate with myself last year when I was shopping. CH had one loaded S60 loaner (the standard length one I think but all the goodies. Tech, so fancy stereo, nannies, whatever they could throw on there. And their initial offer was really strong. But, it was also black over black and I just couldn't do it.

someone got a good deal on that. IIRC sticker was about 46K, and they offered to sell it (I think it was the BIN price, not a cap cost for a lease) of $28k. Talk about depreciation! This was right when the new models were about to land (or were already maybe hiding in the back)."
2233	August 18, 2019 1:33PM	marcogallo1986	@Jmonro. O man! Lol
2234	August 18, 2019 1:35PM	marcogallo1986	@TJC you are welcomme!
2235	August 18, 2019 2:11PM	tjc78	If it doesn’t have Advanced or B&W they come in at like 49,800 unless they have some accessories which pushes them over 50
2236	August 18, 2019 2:16PM	suydam	I would not get black over black myself. Our Encore is black with a grey interior which I do like very much.
2237	August 18, 2019 2:37PM	benjaminh	"Seems like a great deal on an impressive car. I love the styling of the new Volvo S60. Every detail that I've seen inside and out looks great. For instance, the ""Thor's Hammer"" LED headlights are cool imho. And that interior is amazing. My guess is that using a slightly damp hand towel every month or so for touch up might be one way to keep it looking good. The white steering wheel is an unusual feature that I don't think I've seen on a car for quite a while.

What do you like best about your S60 so far? Built in South Carolina?"
2238	August 18, 2019 2:39PM	stickguy	"had the daughter with us yesterday (the enabler!) working on the wife about picking a new car. Was showing some listings. Wife really is anti brown interior. But daughter and I agreed that the pearly white over espresso was really a popping color combo.

Need to get her out cruising the lots (can do on Sunday when they are closed) to see some color options in real light. Looking at pictures online, just doesn't cut it."
2239	August 18, 2019 2:43PM	nyccarguy	"We visited some friends yesterday in Bordentown, NJ. They have completely upgraded their fleet from the last time we saw them. Her car was a 2014 or 2015 Subaru Forester XT & his car was a 2015 Accord EXL V6. She now drives a Tesla Model S 75D & he bought a CPO Estoril Blue 440xi Drop Top M Sport.

Since I was the deciding factor that pushed him to a 440 over a 430, I was asked to test drive them both and give my impressions."
2240	August 18, 2019 2:48PM	benjaminh	"Some more on the Volvo S60.

2241	August 18, 2019 3:22PM	ab348	Sounds like your Bordentown friends have hit the financial jackpot.
2242	August 18, 2019 3:31PM	stickguy	I was thinking, to make those upgrades, somebody had a good last few years.
2243	August 18, 2019 3:52PM	28firefighter	Or their kids are out of daycare now. That’s like getting an $18-24k/year raise per kid around these parts.
2244	August 18, 2019 4:02PM	tjc78	Bingo.... come Sept with just one out I picked up nearly $600 month!
2245	August 18, 2019 4:10PM	jpp75	"@tjc78 Congrats on the S60, that's a great car!! As @michaell mentioned we spent a few minutes at the Volvo dealer yesterday and really their entire lineup is very attractive. The V60 @michaell mentioned would be on my short list if I was shopping, the color combo was perfect and as others have noted the overall interior is top notch for the class.

Fortunately I still love the Tacoma and would regret getting rid of it. I had a chance to do some true off roading with it on vacation last month. It's amazing what the truck can do, especially given my very limited off roading skills. The C30 also continues to please me, for the money it was a great purchase for a fun car.

@pensfan83, hope it all works out with the Tacoma lease, love that color!"
2246	August 18, 2019 4:16PM	tjc78	"There is a lot to like... but honestly the interior is what sold me the most. The tech is great, and the quality of materials is top notch.

It rides wonderfully and handles well enough for me. The Q or 3 are better handlers but I don’t think the interior is as nice."
2247	August 18, 2019 4:51PM	suydam	I don’t know anything about Volvo’s. Do they make a plug in hybrid or an all EV in the US?
2248	August 18, 2019 4:52PM	rny421	"@tjc78 Congrats on the S60! I love the looks of it. I'm definitely the odd man out, and prefer black interiors over light interiors though - but to each their own!

I'm interested to know more about the ride quality and road noise. Our 2012 S60 T6 rode a little too rough for the roads in New York, but I don't have any experience with the newer SPA platform Volvos. I would definitely consider getting an S60 to replace my TLX in a few years."
2249	August 18, 2019 5:19PM	benjaminh	Hey fellow TLX driver, what model do you have? Any pix convenient to post?
2250	August 18, 2019 5:50PM	rny421	It's a 2015 4 cylinder base model, black on black (those are taboo words here ). I bought it a year and a half ago for $20K with about 30K miles as a CPO. Currently have 52K miles on it. I'm happy with it for the most part - the seats are very comfortable, it's quiet, reasonably quick, and gets good gas mileage. On a recent trip where I obeyed the speed limit I got 40 mpg!
2251	August 18, 2019 6:04PM	graphicguy	Oh man....that’s purty! Big congrats!
2252	August 18, 2019 10:08PM	nyccarguy	"So as I stated before, my NJ friends have been working hard lately at their respective jobs and have purchased 2 very nice cars in the past year. I was afforded the opportunity to drive them both, back to back around Route 130 in Bordentown, NJ.

I was impressed with both cars, but one of them completely blew me away. First the Tesla. It’s a Model S 75D. The wife drives it back and forth to work (9 miles each way) and uses it to shuttle the kids around. They have 2 daughters 8 & 6. The Model is is the @stickguy color special. Dark blue with a light interior. It’s a beautiful color combination. Very subtle and sleek looking without the gargantuan sized wheels. The seats are incredibly comfortable. The rear view mirror is tiny. The car has the fixed glass roof and not a sunroof. Cabin is airy and light. AC does an incredible job at cooling the canine down on a very hot day. I start off accelerating normal just to get a feel for a car without an engine. The regenerative brakes take a bit of time to get used to. They start grabbing right when you take your foot off the “gas” pedal. I’m going about 40 in a 35 and my friend tells me to jump on it. No drama, no noise (still very strange as I like the noises my cars make), just an instantaneous blast of speed. We are pushed back into our seats as I’m waiting to make the jump to light speed. It’s that fast. Wow. I’m going over 80 mph, the car feels solid, stable, but feels like it can keep going. The rest of the way, I keep it at normal speeds. The car automatically opens its garage door as you pull into the driveway. I wasn’t expecting much, but will seriously consider a Model 3 once it comes time to replace my beloved Infiniti.

We pull the Tesla into the garage. And my friend goes inside and grabs the keys to his 440xi MSport Convertible. The car is beautiful. Estoril Blue over Black with M Sport package. As awesome as the Tesla was, this is what a car should sound & feel like. Push the start button and the Twin Turbo In-line 6 growls to life. I just love the way the car does everything just right. It is heavy and slower than the Tesla, but so damn sexy. The acceleration, braking, & precise handling that made me fall in love with BMWs many moons ago."
2253	August 18, 2019 10:28PM	28firefighter	Great write ups!
2254	August 18, 2019 10:42PM	tjc78	"@28firefighter
Back seat pics as requested. Both front seats were set to fit me (6’ tall)."
2255	August 18, 2019 10:56PM	28firefighter	I should give one of these a test drive.
2256	August 18, 2019 11:01PM	abacomike	Good luck with the new S60, tjc. Volvo has come a long way in terms of quality and design. Interiors are exquisite, IMO. Don’t forget the pics. 😛
2257	August 18, 2019 11:03PM	abacomike	"@tjc78

Just saw the pics - beautiful combo of exterior and interior colors. Enjoy!"
2258	August 18, 2019 11:05PM	fintail	These shots make it hard for me to believe Volvo is running in the black. Bang for the buck there.
2259	August 19, 2019 12:19AM	roadburner	Volvo is definitely building some outstanding cars. However, their continued pandering to the Safety Gestapo would keep me from purchasing one.
2260	August 19, 2019 12:37AM	qbrozen	they INVENTED the safety gestapo. ;b
2261	August 19, 2019 12:39AM	tjc78	Thanks!
2262	August 19, 2019 12:40AM	tjc78	I don’t think you’d be happy with an S60. Much too soft and FWD biased AWD.
2263	August 19, 2019 12:42AM	stickguy	Heck, I was trying to find a FWD version, skipping the AWD hit to the budget!
2264	August 19, 2019 12:44AM	tjc78	"I really wanted the T6 which comes with AWD.

It’s impressive over 300 HP and zero torque steer."
2265	August 19, 2019 12:46AM	nyccarguy	Thanks! The best part is that he likes each car for what it is. He’s smitten with the BMW & lives the Tesla, but doesn’t drink the Elon Flavored Kool Aid.
2266	August 19, 2019 2:19PM	au1994	@tjc78 - Love the Volvo. Congrats and that is an excellent color combo. I just want to take a nap in those seats!
2267	August 19, 2019 2:21PM	au1994	Enjoying your test drive reports and search. Any interest in a Civic Si? A friend has a silver 4 door and its a really nice package. Handles well, scoots along with the 205hp motor and is delivering 40 on they highway. Not sure if its going to be big enough in the back for car seats though.
2268	August 19, 2019 2:25PM	tjc78	"Thanks ! This morning I finally got to drive it by myself.

It can certainly move if you want to push it. I see no buyer’s remorse with this one."
2269	August 19, 2019 2:39PM	28firefighter	"Funny you bring it up, a family member suggested it to me last night. It is probably a closer competitor to the GLI than the Accord in terms of size, but doesn't keep up performance wise. I have the Honda sales guy I worked with keeping an eye out, but Civic Si sedan inventory is really tight up here.

If I can get my hands on one to try out, I will and will report back."
2270	August 19, 2019 5:57PM	xwesx	"LOL


Carry dogs in your cars a lot, do you?"
2271	August 19, 2019 6:01PM	stickguy	It is important. Dogs can die in a hot car in minutes.
2272	August 19, 2019 6:02PM	xwesx	Speaking of Tesla, I saw a Model 3 in Fairbanks yesterday. Even had Alaska plates on it! First one I've seen 'in the wild' this far north. It wasn't anything to look at: Just a bland black with oversized wheels. But, there it sat, plain as day.
2273	August 19, 2019 6:15PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest. Nice people are getting them in your neck of the woods now to was only a matter of time. I agree with you and stick guy, yes dogs could die in a car in a matter of minutes. And a hot postcard that is ha ha Ha. Let me correct that now before I post it. @TJC you are welcomme!
2274	August 19, 2019 6:24PM	marcogallo1986	@ New York car guy, nice write up on the two new cars your friends got in the past year or color combos on both sounds lovely what of my favorites.
2275	August 19, 2019 6:25PM	marcogallo1986	@TJC Love how you have the white interior color even though might get dirty quick preferred over black.
2276	August 19, 2019 6:28PM	marcogallo1986	@TJC Beautiful color combination.
2277	August 19, 2019 6:28PM	marcogallo1986	@ stick guy, yes I agree best to see it in person even if I could see well I would still want to go see it in person pictures don’t do any good Ha ha ha. Yes get the wife out as soon as you can just start looking on Sundays when everything is closed over there.
2278	August 19, 2019 10:05PM	Michaell	"It's done.

For the first time since I was 18, I no longer have a car that is ""mine"".

Now I'm officially sharing the Outback with the spouse.

The turn in event was pretty benign. The VW dealer directed me to the sister Audi store for the paperwork and handoff. The ""Trade in Appraisals"" desk was separate from the showroom and is likely used for all brands for this dealer ownership group (VW, Audi, Volvo and Mazda). Guy took my keys, confirmed the mileage (16,695 was the final number) and signed a paper indicating I've turned the car in. They removed and gave me the plates, and I was on my way. Maybe 10 minutes, total.

Quite anticlimactic."
2279	August 19, 2019 10:34PM	stickguy	that sounds exactly like the 2 lease turn ins I have done. Much less exciting than trading in for a new one!
2280	August 19, 2019 10:40PM	Michaell	I'm trying to remember the last lease turn in I did. Probably 20 years ago with the Accord I got when I first moved to CO.
2281	August 19, 2019 10:43PM	stickguy	"was bored today at my desk, so wrote out a ""short"" list of the options for the next car (either new, or slightly used loaner or CPO). All small-mid sized CUV types (with a random wagon in there).

Short in """" since I came up with 11 options. And I am sure if I thought more I could make it longer, but I ran out of lines on the paper. A few probably wouldn't fly with the wife, but I do like to keep a couple of more ""budget friendly"" options. She does admit that she is now a brand snob, so going to a mainstream brand from an Acura would be a tough sell! And there are a couple of domestics I like that I know she never will consider.

as of this moment, I would be looking at:

RDX
2020 Outback
X3
V60
XC60
RAV 4 hybrid
Murano SV
Tuarag
Q5
NX300
Passport"
2282	August 19, 2019 10:57PM	tjc78	Nothing wrong with any of those choices, but aren’t you in few different size classes?
2283	August 19, 2019 10:57PM	pensfan83	@tjc78 I love the car, the color combo really works. Enjoy it!
2284	August 19, 2019 10:57PM	28firefighter	I'd take the Murano off the list - I don't see any planet under which she'd be happy with that next to any of the others on that list.
2285	August 19, 2019 10:59PM	tifighter	"Meanwhile, at Volvo corporate-

Sven: Turns out people are cross-shopping the Honda Passport to the V60.

Olaf: [spits Lingonberry juice all over office]"
2286	August 19, 2019 11:03PM	28firefighter	Now THAT'S funny.
2287	August 19, 2019 11:10PM	tjc78	"What’s even funnier is that Sven and Olaf are two major characters in a big (huge) kids movie.

Frozen for those of you without young ones."
2288	August 19, 2019 11:25PM	corvette	I would nix the RAV4 Hybrid. I don’t see a huge benefit over the standard RAV. Acceleration will be disappointing compared to anything else on that list, other than perhaps a 4-cyl Outback.
2289	August 19, 2019 11:28PM	Michaell	"I actually know someone who's doing just that for their next vehicle.

Actually, it's the V90, but still..."
2290	August 19, 2019 11:32PM	pensfan83	"The Tacoma contract was fleshed out and it resulted in several hundred dollars back to me, no complaints.

After taking care of the truck we decided to make a day of it and head up to Ohiopyle since we were over halfway there. Made an impromptu stop in Walmart for swim suits, towels, and other essentials and enjoyed a hot, but fun day up there."
2291	August 20, 2019 12:05AM	Michaell	Time to change your signature!
2292	August 20, 2019 12:45AM	xwesx	Jealous here. Congrats on getting it sorted, and on being able to make a great day of it!
2293	August 20, 2019 1:11AM	stickguy	"A Passport to a V60 makes sense. Heck, last time I was cross-shopping a Civic Si and Ram pickup!

There is a little bit of a spread in size, but they are still (to me) roughly the same class. smaller to larger mid-size, 2 row CUVs. I think the Outback is the longest at 191"", and Rav/NX shortest at 180"". Other criteria is pretty well loaded with goodies. Gotta have power passenger seat, memory drivers seat, moonroof, carplay, high end stereo, BLIS, adaptive cruise, at a minimum. Would also like the other goodies I have now like auto wipers, ventilated seats, LED headlights. Beyond that, needs to drive respectable, be comfy on the highway, and fast enough to be entertaining.

The RAV, I know that is a non starter, but I at least pretend to have some more budget friendly options! The Murano, that was more of a curiosity option (that and a screaming deal on Honcker!). But I suspect one look at it and the wife will Ixnay it.

I forgot to add the Santa Fe Turbo, so throw that on instead."
2294	August 20, 2019 2:11AM	fintail	Funny how some things are regional . There must be a dozen 3s in my office parking garage alone. It'd be interesting to see how one fares in a Fairbanks winter.
2295	August 20, 2019 2:12AM	stickguy	I see a fair amount of them around here (suburban Philly area).
2296	August 20, 2019 2:40AM	stickguy	"here's one for Roadburner. barely broken in.

2298	August 20, 2019 3:08AM	suydam	What would her list look like?
2299	August 20, 2019 3:49AM	stickguy	"Her list?

1) something with no payment
2) If passing on #1, and RDX, with an X3 of the Volvo if the $ worked OK.
3) the Sube if the interior is really as nice as a new Volvo."
2300	August 20, 2019 4:24AM	suydam	Well, that’s a lot simpler, isn’t it!
2301	August 20, 2019 11:10AM	benjaminh	"If you get a Costco quote on a new Q5 I'd be interested in the numbers.

Would you consider the VW Golf Sportwagen?

The interior of the RDX really wowed me when I was at the Acura dealer.

The new Honda Passport seems good, but would that be a bit large for you? But I really like the rear visibility in that car. The back windows look functional rather than small.

The V60 looks good. I like it in this video where at c.8 minutes he goes under the car to look at some of the mechanical parts in some detail."
2302	August 20, 2019 11:56AM	au1994	Great list! In addition to the Santa Fe, a CR-V Touring is a really nice ride and surprisingly roomy as a more budget friendly option. Staying away from the domestics, I'd say you've got the market pretty well covered.
2303	August 20, 2019 12:32PM	marcogallo1986	@ stick dry, that’s quite the list they are I have the wife start looking at soon going to go each weekend and look at a few. Lol
2304	August 20, 2019 12:56PM	stickguy	"Not sure if passport will feel too large, but that’s probably the closest in concept to her current RDX, with the same basic drivetrain.

We looked at CRV last year. She just didn’t like it. Mostly the CVT.

She also doesn’t like VW much to start with. Tiguan might fly but the Golf will just be too small. Q5 might turn her head, though we aren’t Costco members so can’t help there."
2305	August 20, 2019 1:05PM	marcogallo1986	@pensman. Glad all was sorted out with the contract. For your new truck and you are good to go. How was your day trip
2306	August 20, 2019 1:12PM	pensfan83	Only getting a look at the Passport from the outside we like it. Looks like a smaller, slightly sportier version of the Pilot. Give the incentives available on Volvo with the Costco membership you may want to sign up if only for the perks they sometimes throw out if a Volvo is on your list.
2307	August 20, 2019 1:16PM	tjc78	"Tiguan might fly but the Golf will just be too small

Did the Tiguan get bigger? I saw one yesterday and it seemed much larger than I remembered."
2308	August 20, 2019 1:28PM	benjaminh	"stick: do you need 4-wheel drive? If not, you could save some money and get higher mpg.

The Passport is 4 inches longer and 4 inches wider than the RDX, and so the Passport is pretty big. But the Passport does have a lot more cargo space, and of course it costs less.

Passport length 190.5 width 78.6 cargo with seats up 50.5

RDX length 186.8 w 74.8 cargo 29.5

Q5 length 183.6 w 74.5 cargo 25.1

V60 length 187.4 w 72.8 cargo 23.2

CR-V length 180.6 w 73 cargo 39.2

VW Sportwagen length 179.6 w 70.8 cargo 30.4


So the VW Sportwagen and the CRV have more cargo space than all of these except for the Passport."
2309	August 20, 2019 1:41PM	stickguy	"Wow. Love that car in those colors. Would be perfect for me! Wife might prefer sitting a bit higher, but would have to try it out. I won’t pay for the B&W stereo, but the seats, sure!

I want."
2310	August 20, 2019 1:46PM	tjc78	"I didn't audition the B&W because I would have wanted it (I have B&W speakers in my home).... having said that the Harmon/Kardon is no slouch. I still don't have it dialed in exactly the way I want it yet (lots of adjustments) but it sounds good.

Wife took it this morning and she commented how good it sounds. I think the Bose in the Enclave may be a touch louder if pushed, but the Harmon sounds better."
2311	August 20, 2019 1:46PM	stickguy	"A few inches longer, in that 185-190” range, is not an issue. Being much wider, that’s a problem. It’s already tight getting our RDX in the garage without nicking the mirror! Cargo measurements don’t mean much to me. That counts to the ceiling, and I’m obsessed about not going much above the seat top so I can still see out. Floor space acreage is a bigger deal. Volvo looks great there! But, the CRV was a tremendously useful cargo hauler.

The passport is really just a pilot with a slice out of the middle, no third row, and a nose job."
2312	August 20, 2019 1:48PM	stickguy	The redesigned Tiguan is way bigger. Went from a tiny hatch to a roomy midsize CUV. great useful size.
2313	August 20, 2019 1:48PM	graphicguy	"You guys got me thinking about my next car (nowhere in the foreseeable future, though)....

I’ve made no bones about wanting another Acura TLX in S-Type trim. That’s tops on the list, but looks like that model is at least a year to 18 months away.

#5-the Accord 2.0T sounds/looks intriguing if I decide I’d rather keep another $10K-$15K in my pocket that it might take to buy the Acura, the BMW or the Volvo. While I’m at it, may as well throw the Toyota Camry XSE V6 for the same reason. That said, I can’t even remember the last time I drove a Camry. But, the new ones seem to be getting good press."
2314	August 20, 2019 1:49PM	stickguy	Lease the Volvo, problem solved!
2315	August 20, 2019 2:01PM	benjaminh	My guess is that the all-new 2021 TLX Type S will arrive c. 10 months from now.
2316	August 20, 2019 2:08PM	stickguy	Sharp. I think they should replace TLX with that, and the ILX with a small sedan and compact CUV version, something like the BMW x2.
2317	August 20, 2019 2:14PM	ronsteve	Yes it got quite a bit bigger. Went from being one of the shortest behind the 2nd row to having an optional 3rd row.
2318	August 20, 2019 2:32PM	ronsteve	"Cubic footage of cargo space is less useful to me than the footprint. The shape of the back end of the greenhouse can make a big difference in terms of cubic feet but really only comes into play when you put a lot of tall boxes all the way back.

If I'm cargo-space-critical, I'm dropping the back seats..."
2319	August 20, 2019 2:38PM	stickguy	AWD is actually not important to me. Depending on the car, I am fine with FWD. the V60 for sure. RDX I would prefer the SH-AWD.
2320	August 20, 2019 2:53PM	ronsteve	I had a similarly large list in the prelim phases of my shopping last year. Somewhere along the way, almost everything on the original list dropped off and when it got close to go-time the only serious looks went to the V60 (but didn't drive one), XC60, Outback, and the eventual winner was the RDX.
2321	August 20, 2019 3:15PM	pensfan83	With its torque vectoring Acura's SH-AWD is tuned for performance and makes a noticeable impact on the driving experience. Unless you want to avoid the $2K upcharge altogether, I would at least give it a try. It operates similarly to the ATTS system on @nyccarguy's Prelude.
2322	August 20, 2019 3:28PM	28firefighter	I approve of this list. That might have to do with feeling validated since it is so closely resembles my own!
2323	August 20, 2019 3:43PM	benjaminh	"What I like about the TLX Type S concept is that it seems like a nice evolution from the current TLX. The c.2004-2008 Acura TL was a big hit, but then the 2009 TL, rather than evolving from that, introduced the ""power plenum grille."" As the NY Times headlined back then ""Pace. Space. But Oh, That Face.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/automobiles/autoreviews/08acura-tl.html

It was a really nice car, but the styling was a bit much. By 2015 when the TLX was introduced they had finally made it look good.

Anyway, from past experience iirc once Honda/Acura have released a concept car of this kind, usually the production model is on showroom floors less than a year later, and usually looking pretty close. This one doesn't have door handles, which obviously are going to be added....My lease is up in June of 2021. Probably I'll try to buy out my current car, but if the new TLX has a hybrid or electric option, or even just a regular model that gets good mpg, I might consider that."
2324	August 20, 2019 3:44PM	nyccarguy	Without the added expense & complexity of a $2,200 clutch job (2x in 160,000 miles).
2325	August 20, 2019 3:51PM	pensfan83	One of the main reasons I was after a base model.
2326	August 20, 2019 5:02PM	pensfan83	"The thing is you can now ""put a face with the name"" and know it wasn't just lip service from Acura. If the concept's good looks are matched by its performance I'm in."
2327	August 20, 2019 5:26PM	jpp75	"Here's the V60 @michaell and @breld looked at Saturday. As @breld noted it's perfectly optioned, everything you (I) would want but nothing you don't.

I'm not in the market but if I were this would be very tempting. Although as a CCBA the lesson on Volvo is lease or buy used."
2328	August 20, 2019 5:36PM	benjaminh	"Beautiful wagon.

Here's the lease offered at that link....

""Lease: $515 per month for 36 months. $3,995 due at signing for select 2020 Volvo V60 Cross Country T5""

And that's before taxes, acquisition fee, etc."
2329	August 20, 2019 5:37PM	28firefighter	They don't lease well. Because no one buys wagons. So they don't subsidize their sale to get them out there. So no one buys wagons. And on and on the circle game of the american car market goes.
2330	August 20, 2019 5:40PM	jpp75	"Well and if you read the Disclaimer that's for a base model with no options:

Disclaimer:

As @michaell can attest this dealer group has really gotten somewhat slimy with their sales tactics, so if I was going to buy it I'd go to a dealer I like better first and see if they could swap."
2331	August 20, 2019 5:54PM	au1994	That's too bad because that's a beautiful wagon. I love that interior.
2332	August 20, 2019 6:08PM	ab348	"I've never seen a newer Volvo with plaid upholstery like that before.

Is the wagon also refreshed like the sedan? I'm not up to speed on Volvos since very few get sold here and the dealer is terrible."
2333	August 20, 2019 6:13PM	tifighter	I bought my XC70. It was below invoice, with 0% for 60mos on offer. Traded it about four years later for a good number. Maintenance was included. So all in all, it cost me about $4700 per year, excluding fuel etc. Not bad, and very comparable to a good lease deal IMO. It can be done.
2334	August 20, 2019 6:28PM	stickguy	"I would buy a service loaner of same model year, for the savings.

That wagon is same colors as the one in road test video. Would need to. See seats in person. Wife would likely hate them.

I would also pass on the polestar (am I the only one that thinks of a strip club when I see that name?) and 19” wheels. Mo sidewall is Mo betta."
2335	August 20, 2019 6:44PM	au1994	I still hear the Beavis and Butthead laugh in my head when I hear Polestar. I know, I’m not proud.

2337	August 20, 2019 8:57PM	marcogallo1986	@ all of the above that’s funny just made me laugh thinking of B watson Butthead, and stick guy thinking that reminds him of a strip club every time he hears polestar ha ha Ha.

""In a Slowing U.S. Auto Market, Minivan Sales Are Falling 7 Times Faster Than the Overall Market
By Timothy Cain on August 20, 2019

The minivan as we know it is not dead. Credit for the minivan segment’s still-beating heart belongs in large part to the disappearance of most contenders – so few competitors remain that a handful of remaining minivan nameplates may well still sell in six figures in the United States in 2019.

Most automakers determined years ago that sticking their forks into this pie isn’t worth it; the pie was just too small. The absence of GM, Ford, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, along with the steady rise of the family-oriented crossover, caused the pie’s shrinkage to continue. Nissan and Mazda left, too, and the pie kept shrinking.

In fact, the rate at which the minivan pie is shrinking has picked up speed. Auto sales are slowing, to be fair, but U.S. minivan sales volume in 2019 is slowing nearly seven times faster. And no, for FCA and Toyota and Honda and Kia, the whole “bigger slice of a smaller pie” argument just isn’t holding water these days.

According to Automotive News, auto sales fell 2.4 percent in 2019’s first half. Minivan volume, however, was down 15.8 percent....""

2339	August 20, 2019 11:50PM	xwesx	Ironic, considering the area once had a Volvo factory, I think you said?
2340	August 21, 2019 12:51AM	ab348	"Yes, there was Vovlo assembly done here in 3 different locations from the mid-60s through the early '90s. In the '80s there was even a trial of a Volvo 760 as a police car and the Mayor had a Volvo provided as his official car.

In the '60s and '70s the dealers were small, locally owned operations that varied in quality but which were quite approachable. Later on they passed into the hands of one of the premium automobile groups as Volvo went upmarket and the same place selling Porsches, Jaguars and Land Rovers now had Volvo as well. They were not easy to deal with and tended to intimidate many buyers surrounded by very high-end cars, and treated Volvo as the poor cousin."
2341	August 21, 2019 12:51AM	stickguy	"assembly plant. I think they came in as kits.

I just remember the story he linked to about the car ship that went down taking a bunch of Volvos to the bottom."
2342	August 21, 2019 12:59AM	stickguy	speaking of Volvo police cars, I remember a test from way back in the day (car and driver I think, could have been road and track) where they compared alternative police cars. Nova was one, and the Volvo 164 was another. The Volvo tested really well.
2343	August 21, 2019 1:20AM	corvette	My “full size SUV” rental in Tampa is an Infiniti QX80. It feels every bit as big and ponderous as my Tahoe. I was shocked by the amount of brake dive, even in light to moderate braking. There is no CarPlay, and I made the mistake of trying to use the built in nav instead of Waze until I realized it was telling me to drive in circles. It does not feel like it has the 400 horsepower they claim it does. The 360 degree camera is pretty neat, but I was disappointed to find that my base model example stickers for $68k and doesn’t have blind spot monitoring, despite having relatively narrow mirrors. If someone gave me one to replace the Tahoe, I probably wouldn’t go to the trouble of selling it to buy something else, but I don’t think it would make the short list if I were shopping on my own. Maybe if I could find a better equipped used example for a song.
2344	August 21, 2019 1:27AM	ab348	Is that the body on frame model based off the Titan pickup?
2345	August 21, 2019 1:59AM	stickguy	Infiniti Armada?
2346	August 21, 2019 2:11AM	fintail	Sounds like my rental Armada late last year - ancient ICE, I don't think it had a 360 camera, and some of the worst seats I've experienced.
2347	August 21, 2019 2:21AM	corvette	Yes, I think they share the platform with the first gen Titan. Seats are okay so far, but I only drove it about 20 miles. Apparently the Limited trim (over $20k more) has a fancier suspension which might reduce the brake dive I experienced. Overall, I’m not completely disappointed, but also not shocked these are being sold to rental fleets.
2348	August 21, 2019 2:23AM	stickguy	I get links to Odyclub posts (guess I never un-signed up for those!) Every time I read another VCM problem story, I think I need to energize the wife to look harder now!

2350	August 21, 2019 3:06AM	breld	"That stinks!

Any recourse with the bicyclist?"
2351	August 21, 2019 3:09AM	stickguy	my guess, he flipped Bradd the bird and kept right on riding.
2352	August 21, 2019 3:14AM	nyccarguy	No. He went down. I opened my window and asked 3 times if he was ok. I saw him get up and start walking away. I went on my merry way.
2353	August 21, 2019 3:21AM	breld	"Would he have any legal liability for the damage? Nothing worth pursuing. Just curious.

Probably more of a Judge Judy type of thing. 😀"
2354	August 21, 2019 4:25AM	corvette	When I hear the term “donorcycle,” I immediately think of the way a lot of bicyclists ride.
2355	August 21, 2019 4:32AM	andres3	Golf R.... but of course, costs a bit more, unless you go CPO/used.
2356	August 21, 2019 4:47AM	28firefighter	And a MUCH smaller rear seat.
2357	August 21, 2019 7:50AM	mb_enthusiast	"I took my Audi Q8 into the dealer Monday after having trouble with some creaking in the left b pillar. I believe it is coming from seat belt adjuster. I hear the creaking all the time without the stereo loud enough. The dealer claimed that they couldn't replicate the issue. Are they deaf? This issue has been mentioned on AudiWorld and YouTube as well. It would be one thing if they said it was normal. It's another thing to suggest that I am imagining things.

I also mentioned that the tailgate doesn't always open using the remote. Sometimes it only unlocks and pops up slightly. Same claim. Not able to replicate the issue. The first time I try to open the tailgate after picking it up Tuesday evening, it does the same thing. I happened to catch it on video.

Did I mention that the car appeared to be parked at someone's residence for most of the day Monday? The service advisor had claimed that she would contact me Monday afternoon and that everything should be ready by the evening...she never did contact me. I contacted her that evening. It's obvious that they just never got to my car. I've not been pleased with Audi dealership customer service so far. My preferred dealership was booked out a month in advance for service."

2363	August 21, 2019 1:17PM	stickguy	That might buff out! Though given you street park in the city, I would expect that kind of battle scar.
2364	August 21, 2019 1:57PM	graphicguy	"Thanks for the vid @benjaminh

Lots of exterior shots of the upcoming TLX S-Type. But, I’ve yet to see any of the interior. They have the cars right there, but no one has thought to stick a camera up against the window to take a shot of the interior?

Hope you’re right about the release being in the next 10 months. I’m just thinking they do this like they do their other rollouts. The “regular” redesigned TLX comes first, and the S-Type comes sometime thereafter. 2021 models should hit the showrooms next summer.

@nyccarguy ...looks like you buffed out most of the scrape. Just wondering if any of those “wonder scratch removers” like SCRATCHX would work on the rest?"
2365	August 21, 2019 3:07PM	pensfan83	"I wonder if Acura would do something similar to BMW where you have the full M cars and M ""light"" such as the M340i, M550i with the A-Spec similar to M ""light""."
2366	August 21, 2019 3:19PM	28firefighter	"Jason Cammisa posted on his Instagram that his in-depth test of the GLI was mixed though landed on it being a great performance value for the money.

His biggest complaints seemed to be a DSG that behaved too much like an automatic, the lack of GTI seats, a very rattly interior (rattles with the radio off and then with the radio on and a little bass, sounded like the doors would fall off), and a silly Digital cockpit.

None of the above bothers me too much, except the rattling, It is my single biggest pet peeve in a car and would seriously kill it for me."
2367	August 21, 2019 3:43PM	graphicguy	"Well...from what I’ve read, the new TLX platform is all new and exclusive to Acura. That tells me they aren’t using the Accord platform for the new TLX.

S-Type has been strongly rumored to be getting a twin turbo V6.

So, what does that leave? Maybe a base version using a tweaked version of the 2.0T from the Accord? 275HP, maybe? An A-Spec TLX getting a single turbo V6 (which would matchup to the BMW M lite series?

I’m just speculating, but there are several different ways to go once you sit the TLX S-Type at the top of the ladder."
2368	August 21, 2019 3:45PM	28firefighter	I could see the TLX dropping the NA 2.4 4 cylinder engine completely. TLX models would get the 2.0T accord engine at 252 HP with the TLX A-Spec getting the Type R version of that engine at 306 HP. TLX Type S would get the twin turbo V6.
2369	August 21, 2019 3:54PM	tjc78	"@28firefighter
That makes perfect sense. So I'm going to guess it won't happen that way!"
2370	August 21, 2019 4:02PM	breld	As infrequently as I drive my stepdaughter's Jetta, I do notice rattling that I attribute to the first year of the new model. That would certainly give me pause on pulling the trigger on a GLI.
2371	August 21, 2019 4:08PM	pensfan83	I'd be perfectly happy with that setup.
2372	August 21, 2019 5:40PM	au1994	Its one of mine too. I'd give them about 2 cracks to fix it or be looking to trade.
2373	August 21, 2019 5:44PM	au1994	I saw a Gladiator in the wild this morning. Silver Sport S model, dealer tag but already had a mild lift and bigger tires on it. Nice looking rig, longer than I expected but that makes the bed a pretty useful size for most of us.
2374	August 21, 2019 5:50PM	28firefighter	"I'll give it another test drive, but if it's rattling during a test drive then I'm out. When I drove the Accord and the TLX, they were dead quiet. And the Accord had 4k miles on it, so any rattles would have surfaced by then.

I'd be more understanding in a cheaper car (e.g. a Jetta S), but in something that is supposed to be a higher end version? No way. Cheap plastic comes at a price..."
2375	August 21, 2019 6:18PM	stickguy	"TLX is really solidly built. I assume the next one will just have the 4 cyl turbo engines. Maybe base 2.0, and upgrade the 2.3 from the RDX?

Much easier to engineer if not using a V6, but must be anyway if the S type has one. So maybe they keep the NA V6 too."
2376	August 21, 2019 6:50PM	mb_enthusiast	Thanks for asking! He's making progress. He has some surgical consults upcoming. He's going to need some surgery on his large intestine and a total hip replacement. The latter is obviously a very major surgery. He's currently staying in a sub-acute rehab facility. Month in hospital > almost a month in acute rehab > now one week so far in sub-acute rehab.
2377	August 21, 2019 7:32PM	nyccarguy	ok, so he's making progress.
2378	August 21, 2019 7:43PM	benjaminh	As you know, the TXL was introduced in the late summer of 2014 as a 2015 model. Counting the 2019 model year it's already been around for 5 years, which is why I'm guessing that the 2020 model year will be a short one. Because Acura is enhancing its performance DNA, I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the Type S will be available at launch. Acura knows that only a tiny number will buy the Type S, but the press is likely to give it something of a splash, making it a halo car for the rest of the all-new TLX lineup. An Acura turbo 6 might have 400 hp....
2379	August 21, 2019 7:43PM	benjaminh	"This sounds likely. ++

I would appreciate a hybrid as well, but I'm one of the very few who would.

My TLX 2.4 can get 35-40 mpg on the highway, plus since it isn't a turbo I feel like if I decided to keep it for ten years and 150,000 miles it would likely be reliable."

2382	August 21, 2019 8:24PM	fintail	I like the $69 paint upcharge, what is this, 1970?
2383	August 21, 2019 8:36PM	28firefighter	Looks like there is a $799 doc fee added on and the price includes all available rebates. I bet they also add a surcharge for being out of area.
2384	August 21, 2019 8:36PM	ab348	Could be that they added up all of the possible incentives shown on the right to get close to that number. Odds of any one person qualifying for all of them is slim to none.
2385	August 21, 2019 8:36PM	28firefighter	MB, BMW, Audi, etc. all charge WAY more than that for special paint colors and metallic paint upgrades. So no, just 2019.
2386	August 21, 2019 8:37PM	tjc78	Volvo charged $645 for white.

2391	August 21, 2019 9:38PM	qbrozen	They claim no special incentives. I got a response with a breakdown and they are saying over $5k dealer discount and the $4850 factory rebate. I could also qualify for an additional $500 conquest, it seems. BUT, in addition to the aforementioned $799 doc fee, they have listed the $1495 destination fee on top of the sticker price that already includes destination. I have run into this scam before, at another dodge dealer, interestingly enough. I emailed back to call them out on it. No response yet.
2392	August 21, 2019 9:38PM	28firefighter	Transfer that sucker out. It has been tarnished now that it was hit.
2393	August 21, 2019 9:40PM	28firefighter	So what you're saying is with that $2100 added in, they're basically at auction value for a used 2019? Doesn't seem so bad. That destination fee I think is what they charge to out of area consumers.
2394	August 21, 2019 9:41PM	stickguy	I assumed that after the crash it was not going to be easy to dispose of. But, I guess when there is a will, there is a way.
2395	August 21, 2019 9:45PM	nyccarguy	Isn’t that available for the $10/horsepower rebate too?

But I don’t mind extra cars, either. ;b
I dunno. I’m just playing with the idea. I have never even driven one. But I have extra cash now and couldn’t resist looking around. I did tell the wife we should pay off the solar panels, though, so I may squash the car idea for now. I should just try to finish the coronet. Time is not easy to come by, though."

2402	August 22, 2019 3:48AM	stickguy	"I am fine with just sending QB in. Though they probably have his picture posted on the wall with a ""broom this guy"" note on it.

I am sure though that a broker would be able to get a deal I probably couldn't on my own, even factoring in the fee."
2403	August 22, 2019 10:20AM	pensfan83	That's a really nicely equipped example for a loaner.
2404	August 22, 2019 11:45AM	ronsteve	Agreed on the 2-tone interior! That example would be enough to make me take a long look at a Cross Country. The white-over-black of the other one, I would definitely shy away from.
2405	August 22, 2019 1:02PM	marcogallo1986	@ York cargo wow people are on believable he just walked away while roadway and then even answer you stinks on the minor damage there but you’re OK that’s the main thing.
2406	August 22, 2019 1:03PM	marcogallo1986	@MB enthusiast I hate when the Steelers say that they could definitely clearly hear it. They just didn’t get to your car or they don’t care enough.
2407	August 22, 2019 1:03PM	marcogallo1986	Thanks for the update on your dad also.
2408	August 22, 2019 1:30PM	jpp75	I like the CC as well, and those prices are precisely why I wouldn't buy a new one.
2409	August 22, 2019 2:26PM	28firefighter	"My Mom has a 2015.5 V60 T5 CC (basically identical to what you posted, @stickguy). They're a lot of car for the money. The T5 engine is..pokey...at best IMO. Has decent low end grunt like you'd expect from a turbo, but then tops out fairly quickly.

Also it has been through one transmission and 3 fuel pumps in the 4 years they've had it. My guess is that is a one off and not the norm."
2410	August 22, 2019 2:28PM	carnaught	"Interesting how they list premium options, and mention some more than once, like pano roof mentioned three times. Doesn’t have 360 degree camera or upgraded audio, though.

Like the color combo, don’t like the price."
2411	August 22, 2019 2:36PM	stickguy	Good though that price is the one thing you can change!
2412	August 22, 2019 2:58PM	ronsteve	"Sounds like they got a bad copy. I had a V70 for over 11 years and aside from the crankcase vent service and age-related stuff, my only big unscheduled repair was a power steering pump. When I traded it with 192K it was starting to show some electrical gremlins, and was going to need the crankcase vent done again.

As for performance, I can see the ""pokey"" off the line, mainly because of how intrusive the TC was, but it pulled solidly when I went to make a move on the highway. My RDX that replaced it feels much stronger off the line but at highway cruise speeds, the VCM forces you to get on it hard enough to downshift if you're trying to hit a gap."
2413	August 22, 2019 3:41PM	stickguy	I actually would prefer a loaded FWD T5 model V60. Probably quicker too, and more economical.
2414	August 22, 2019 3:50PM	jpp75	I had the T5 in my 2015.5 S60, FWD. It had plenty of power for me but I can see what you mean about it topping out quickly. In 39 months and 45k miles the only issue I had was a backup camera that went wonky and an O2 sensor that failed early on.
2415	August 22, 2019 3:56PM	benjaminh	Farewell to the VW Alltrack....
2416	August 22, 2019 4:10PM	ronsteve	The T5 in the AWD models then was the 2.5L 5-cylinder, with a 6-speed auto, while the FWD had gone to the Drive-E powertrain with the 2.0L 4-cylinder and 8-speed auto.
2417	August 22, 2019 4:17PM	qbrozen	"I don't know why I have decided to even argue with these people. Just irritates me, I guess...


internet person:
I saw you asked a common question that alot of our customers ask about the destination fee. It is not being charged twice, we aren't charging MSRP plus destination. Also when the car is discounted we itemize the destination and the processing fee which are line items. If the car was being sold at MSRP we would back out the destination and then add it back in to show it as a line item. It is the way we prefer to show our prices, which doesn't stop us for offering the very best deals on our Scat Packs in the region to our customers. I hope this helped clear things up and I am happy to assist you with any additional questions you may have.


my reply:

So, here is a breakdown of the monroney, which includes destination, then your quote, which includes destination again. Just follow the math, and you'll see you are charging it twice.

Base Price . $40,245

OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT . $69

Destination Charge . $1,495

TOTAL PRICE . $41,809


MSRP/Retail Price . $41,809

Dealer Discount . $5,716

Price Before Rebates . $36,093

Your Rebates . $4,850

Wow Price . $31,243

Destination Charge . $1,495

Processing Fee . $799

Price Before Tax and Tags . $33,537"
2418	August 22, 2019 4:23PM	28firefighter	"Every single VA dealer I've seen does this across all brands. Just consider it a cost of doing business. What they're saying is that $1495 of their $5716 ""discount"" is actually just backing out the Destination Fee which they plan to put back in. It is absolute asinine.

You said it was 2k before auction value at the advertised price - so adding it back in, you're at auction price, right?"
2419	August 22, 2019 5:14PM	tjc78	"Stuff like that really irritates me and in all honesty makes you wonder if they think we are all idiots.

That's one thing I have to say after dealing with 4 different Volvo dealers. None of them tried any tricks, bumped up MF or BS fees. It just came down to who wanted to shave the most off of MSRP to yield the lowest payment."
2420	August 22, 2019 5:51PM	qbrozen	"So, just to summarize, she wrote back to say ""that's just the way we do it."" I wrote back to say ""so your 57xx discount is actually $42xx, why not just say that?"" Then she wrote again and said ""I get it, and I agree, but its the way everyone in VA is, so we need to do it, too.""

Anyhoo, yes, its still a good price. But I've decided I can't justify spending ~$36k, all said and done. I mean, at least before that $1500 bump, I could get out from under it with little to no penalty. But now, it would cost me a couple grand after figuring taxes and fees.

What I HAVE done is start pushing the habit on myself of putting my bimmer in sport/sport mode when I start it up. LOL."
2421	August 22, 2019 6:04PM	pensfan83	There used to be someone on LH who worked at a CDJR dealer in Virginia and he used to get called out on that all the time from what I recall. Makes no sense.
2422	August 22, 2019 6:15PM	pensfan83	For some of the things I have read about Toyota dealers I experienced none of it. No markups, willingness to negotiate via email, and a discount that exceeded anyone else.
2423	August 22, 2019 6:28PM	ab348	It is a good deal for a somewhat fast car that is probably great fun to drive, but the gloomy-looking black cloth interior would be a drag every time you drove it.
2424	August 22, 2019 7:15PM	mb_enthusiast	"I sent a video of the tailgate issue to the service advisor. I know she read it, as it was sent via iMessage (that's the way we communicated previously). She has not had anything to say about it and it's been more than 24 hours.

I've never had a service advisor ignore me. I did have a Jaguar salesman ghost me one time when his manager decided that they could not compete with the other Jaguar dealer up the street. Anyway, I'm kind of pissed off with the customer service given the car's price.

I think I've decided that my experience with that dealership is over. I'm just going to deal with the month-long wait time to get into my preferred's service department."
2425	August 22, 2019 8:38PM	corvette	@mb_enthusiast I’d definitely let Audi corporate know about it when you get a survey.
2426	August 22, 2019 9:24PM	marcogallo1986	@ MP enthusiast that’s totally unacceptable, like mentioned above but Audi corporate know about the issues you’re having with this dealer, and yes call your preferred dealer. Worth the wait
2427	August 22, 2019 9:32PM	28firefighter	I'm supposed to go the BMW Ultimate Driving Event autocross this weekend, but in my infinite wisdom did not pay attention to the fact that the event is basically in Tacoma (yet they're calling it Seattle). Now I have to decide if I want to drive the 1-1.5 hours (if there is traffic) to get there...
2428	August 22, 2019 9:32PM	marcogallo1986	@qB not cool the games that the dealers like. To play
2429	August 22, 2019 10:49PM	tifighter	Which day?
2430	August 22, 2019 10:58PM	28firefighter	"Saturday around lunch time.

I'm still in negotiations because technically we have plans..."
2431	August 22, 2019 10:58PM	xwesx	Just take the train.
2432	August 22, 2019 11:05PM	laurasdada	"Ok, so I replaced the rear brakes in the XF last week, not inexpensive. A year ago, four new sneakers, reasonably priced (buy 3 get 1 free, tax free weekend in MA).
Now, left rear turn signal bulb appears to be shot, inexpensive maybe...

What is my beautiful car trying to tell me?! ; - )

Labor day week, I may test drive a few potential replacements:
'18 Porsche Macan
'20 Jag XE
'19 Audi A5 Sportback
Volvo S60? Any reliability concerns (from the British car owner...)

None, pre-test drive of course, really has me chomping at the bit to replace the XF."
2433	August 22, 2019 11:19PM	qbrozen	"Huh. For some reason I thought the XF was already out of your stable.

May I suggest a Maser Ghibli? Not that I have any idea why. Just because I want to suggest it to someone, I suppose. But lightly used ones are relatively cheap."

I looked at Ghiblis, found it to be cramped, couldn't really got comfortable behind the wheel. Felt a bit too Chrysler-y for the price."

2439	August 23, 2019 2:17AM	stickguy	"probably not much. Even that crowd won't want that car.

amusing how far we have come. A fancy V-12, and only 262 HP. Your average 2.0T 4 banger puts out more than that now!"
2440	August 23, 2019 2:18AM	andres3	"Yes, very much so! In fact, it's big enough my wife got one, an SEL 4-Motion in Stone Blue with a Gray interior. I think they said it's nearly 11"" longer than the previous Tiguan. It's also taller I think too, and of course, for 2019, comes with a 6 year 72,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.

PUNCH reported!"
2441	August 23, 2019 2:19AM	andres3	
2442	August 23, 2019 2:21AM	stickguy	"was considering going to look at that Volvo wagon I found yesterday. Figured I could trade the RDX, have a modest payment on a 3 year loan, let the wife drive it for the next 2 years, then when the TLX lease is up, take it from her and let her get something new.

Then I realized that while it is a nice car, every time I looked at the dash board, I would think about how much nicer the new model is!

Too bad Acura doesn't seem to have any interest in blowing out RDXs on a cheap, cheap lease. I could make that work on a lease to buy! Though might be possible to do better on an X3 loaner.

might need to make a couple stops this weekend, just to show her stuff! The car show is still 5 months away, and who can wait that long?"
2443	August 23, 2019 3:13AM	28firefighter	Saw a Hyundai Palisade in the parking garage at the gym. Barely fit in the spot.

2448	August 23, 2019 4:01AM	stickguy	Q, I like the colors on both of those. Red one seems like a better deal being 2 years newer.
2449	August 23, 2019 4:04AM	breld	"@andres3 - I really like that Tiguan, especially the color.

Congrats!"
2450	August 23, 2019 4:05AM	breld	Agreed. First thing that went through my head when I read your post...”why?”
2451	August 23, 2019 10:02AM	tjc78	Congrats, @andres3 ... great color.
2452	August 23, 2019 11:22AM	stickguy	that is a nice looking car. I was at the VW dealer Wednesday and Thursday nights, but neither time was able to take the time to scope out a Tiguan (or go next door to look at the Q5). The tiguan is a nice package, and definitely roomy.
2453	August 23, 2019 1:24PM	fintail	The more angular/chiseled design of the latest Tiguan certainly helps it, nice color too.
2454	August 23, 2019 1:31PM	suydam	Love the Tiguan, color is beautiful and it’s very good looking. Congrats! What’s the interior look like?
2455	August 23, 2019 2:01PM	stickguy	Told the wife this morning that we could stop at a few dealers this weekend when we went by them, just to sit in stuff and look at colors on the lot. She didn’t object, so probably a good sign!
2456	August 23, 2019 2:18PM	tjc78	That’s how you do it
2457	August 23, 2019 2:20PM	graphicguy	"I’d be just fine with this.

That begs the question, is the RLX going away? Acura has mentioned the S-Type work going on at least one one more model (in addition to the TLX). But, I haven’t heard one peep about the RLX being anywhere near this playpen. As it sits, the RLX does not show up on the radar for Acura. Plus, they don’t make many of them anyway. And, the ones they do make, languish on the lots."
2458	August 23, 2019 2:25PM	graphicguy	"My first thought was “what a performance bargain”. Then, I looked through the pics of the interior and thought “now I know why it’s so cheap”.

I mean really Chrysler, you couldn’t do a better job than that?"
2459	August 23, 2019 2:25PM	fintail	Last time I checked, RLX was down to double digit monthly sales - and I am surprised it is that high.
2460	August 23, 2019 2:27PM	graphicguy	You guys were ready to banish me when I was thinking about a Massi. Now, you’re encouraging people? LOL!

2462	August 23, 2019 2:32PM	carnaught	@andres3, congrats on the punch. I like it.
2463	August 23, 2019 4:40PM	andres3	"Looks good, typical VW (Golf-like, not Jetta ""rental fodder"" like). Sorry if that's too harsh for the Jetta owners/leasers here. Let me say I haven't seen the current generation Jetta interior in person yet.

It also looks superior with the gray leatherette interior. vs. the typical all black on black. I'll have to take some interior shots and post them soon. Being an SEL it's pretty fully loaded, including an HD cluster/gauge screen, memory driver's seat, navigation, and a host of safety features you'd expect in a '19 car. I'm cool with VW's leatherette; same as in the Alltrack basically.

Only thing it doesn't have that might be missed is the Fender Audio. The stock audio seems pretty good for a base system though; I wonder if the SEL ""base audio"" is superior to that in the S or SE models that are more stripped down. Fender audio requires the SEL Premium line, which costs a lot more because it has expensive leather, although not really a nice leather. If you want leather in a VW, get the Golf R or that new expensive VW sedan is even better."

2467	August 23, 2019 6:26PM	stickguy	Not bad looking. But I can’t bring myself to pay that much for a 4 (real time, about to be 5 model) YO Audi out of warranty.

More pics when you can."
2469	August 23, 2019 6:27PM	28firefighter	I would do it from CarMax and get their extended warranty which is among the best in the business. I'm going to go drive it, for S&Gs.
2470	August 23, 2019 6:34PM	au1994	was just tooling around on a local VW dealer site to see if I could find a color match to @andres3 . I did and its sharp but I also looked at an Arteon, Thats a sexy little beast. Poor mans A5 sportback.
2471	August 23, 2019 6:46PM	ab348	"The Tiguan posts prompted me to see what might be different with VW's Canadian models but aside from the trim level names there doesn't seem to be much. Instead of SE, SEL, etc here they go Trendline, Comfortline and Highline. All have the same 180HP engine. Sounds like it might be a bit pokey but I guess it has good low-end torque. Up here they are offering $2000 bonus cash on any trim or 0% financing on 72 months or less, but not both at the same time. One odd thing I didn't understand: the financing details page on any 0% rate has a footnote saying the effective rate is 12% (!) but when you stretch it to 84 months with a 2.99% rate the effective rate shows as 4.53%. I don't get that.

One interesting thing is that regardless of paint color chosen, you get a choice of black or grey interior, but no paint color has a beige interior option, which used to be VW's standard alternative to black inside."
2472	August 23, 2019 7:19PM	breld	I completely agree it's a sharp car and has a lot going for it. The value proposition gets a bit muddy when you consider we bought our A5 Sportback (Prestige trim) as a CPO loaner w/5k miles for $48k.
2473	August 23, 2019 7:36PM	stickguy	Need to update your profile to get the GTI in there. Still showing Miata
2474	August 23, 2019 7:42PM	au1994	True, I think I pulled up a lower level one that was 37k.
2475	August 23, 2019 7:58PM	breld	Some people simply like to buy new though - in which case the Arteon may make a lot of sense. But for those of us (like all of us here) who enjoy the shopping experience, you can almost always find a better value used.
2476	August 23, 2019 7:59PM	breld	Done. Thanks!
2477	August 23, 2019 8:05PM	stickguy	the Arteon I just saw in the VW showroom IIRC stickered for a bit over $44k. Not paying that for a new VW.
2478	August 23, 2019 8:09PM	breld	"Only one week after taking delivery, but I am enjoying the GTI even more than I figured.

My overall driving life is going through some significant changes. Our move date is two weeks away, and we'll be living in the neighborhood of my boys' schools (and thus, their social and sports lives). My older son got his license this past summer - and anyone who has gone through that can attest to how much that changes things.

I've been living at the new house part-time (when my boys are staying with me) while my wife has been keeping up our current home for sale (we're finally under contract and scheduled to close in a few weeks). So I'm already experiencing the dramatic shift in my commute. Whereas I used to drive 35 miles to get my kids to school and then another 15 miles to work (and then repeat for the afternoon to get back home), I now have no school dropoff duties, and my commute is limited to just the 15 mile roundtrip to and from work. Baseball practice and workouts? My older son obviously drives himself, and is happy to take his younger brother to his events.

I put about 30,000 miles on the Q7 over the past 13 months.

For my current purposes, the GTI is a perfectly adequate commuting car.

Which leads me to...I'm not so sure I need something as grand as the Q7 anymore."
2479	August 23, 2019 8:13PM	stickguy	what does your son drive?
2480	August 23, 2019 8:20PM	breld	He has his mom's old MDX (2012, I think?).

If this is the same traveling BMW event I attended
south of Atlanta a couple of months ago, the autocross
is very tight [ keeps speeds down, obviously ] so if
that is of interest, their gas & tires = good deal.
The one here also included a raft of BMWs to drive
without anyone else in the right seat.
THAT made it worthwhile, for me.

2489	August 24, 2019 12:08AM	xwesx	"@breld - Congrats on the upcoming closing! That's a little less stress in your life (or soon to be)! My suggestion would be to just hold on the Q7 for a while until things settle in at your new place, then make a decision once life gets to the ""new normal."" As others have noted, it is quite handy to have something like that around. Maybe, if you go into crazy man mode, you could do something like a pickup for your ""truckster"" and just use it when needed.

Rivian?"
2490	August 24, 2019 12:15AM	28firefighter	"So I sat in the Q5 and am planning to go back and drive it on Sunday.

It is super clean inside and out - especially for a CarMax car. No real scratches, no dings, no obvious body work. Inside looks brand new with no smells.

It’s a pretty standard Audi interior of that era. Well equipped with Nav, Park Assist, BLIS, Bang & Olufsen stereo etc. What it reminded me of is that, frankly, the Audi interiors just feel a cut above. Even this particular car with 37k miles felt better appointed than our X1 which felt cheap and plasticky by comparison when we got back in.

Stay tuned for test drive results on sunday."
2491	August 24, 2019 12:33AM	sda	We’ve had our 16 Q5 a month as of two days ago. We are both impressed by its quality and driving finesse. I showed my wife how to use the Sport mode as she felt the car a bit sluggish in bumper to bumper traffic as the transmission seeks the highest gear as soon as possible which sometimes makes the car lug a bit. She switches between Sport and Drive (normal) appropriately and is amazed how much she loves driving it. Happily, no regrets.
2492	August 24, 2019 12:55AM	corvette	@28firefighter CarMax told me that one couldn’t be reserved when I clicked on your link. Hope it’s not sold already.
2493	August 24, 2019 1:21AM	28firefighter	They told me it’s reserved for me on a Sunday. I’m not worried - plenty of Q5s around.
2494	August 24, 2019 2:12AM	stickguy	I think my wife would really like the Q5 if she got to drive one. She just has a thing about VW and Audi. Not sure why. My son's A3 had a really nice, high quality interior. Loved those seats too.

2496	August 24, 2019 3:49AM	andres3	Unless a car is manufactured on Mars, 1,500 for destination is outrageous.
2497	August 24, 2019 3:55AM	andres3	Purchase, and a helluva deal too. Some dealers are aggressively discounting more than others.
2498	August 24, 2019 5:06AM	Sandman6472	"Stick, I think your wife might come around once she drives an Audi or VW again. I really like both of ours and will look at the Q3 once I get serious about replacing my Golf. Just not at that point yet to be honest. But do think your wife is ready to replace her Acura, once she finds ""her perfect vehicle"", she'll be ready to flip them the keys from her RDX. Like my wife, she just needs the time to find, then drive it a bunch of times to make definitely sure it's the right one. That's why I leave her be while she's looking and just go with her when she's about to write the check and exchange keys. Want it to be totally her decision so I cannot be blamed later for anything!!!

Car and Driver really likes the VW Tiguan overall, but says acceleration isn't ideal.

https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a28758732/2019-vw-tiguan-by-the-numbers/

""....the Tiguan does feel peppier on the road than its numbers suggest, especially with its Sport drive mode selected, which sharpens the engine's throttle response and somewhat tempers the eight-speed automatic transmission's tendency to rapidly upshift to top gear for maximum efficiency. The Tiguan also exhibits reasonably good body control and outright composure when driven spiritedly, as well as a decent 0.85 g of lateral grip around the skidpad. Just remember that getting up to highway speeds will test your patience, and that passing maneuvers on two-lane roads require some planning. Is the Tiguan a suitable alternative to VW's now-discontinued station wagons? Although it's slower—much slower—the Tiguan offers more passenger space, similar cargo capacity, and nearly identical EPA fuel economy estimates to the all-wheel-drive SportWagen and Alltrack. We'll miss those long-roofed cars for their sharper driving dynamics and their novelty in an ever-growing sea of SUVS, but the Tiguan's practicality and appeal are difficult to deny."""
2501	August 24, 2019 10:42AM	qbrozen	"Yeah, I can’t really understand how/why Dodge charges more than a company shipping in cars from overseas.

But, then again, I never understood the fee at all. Just bake it into the price. Its not like the destination fee varies by region, so why pretend it means anything?"
2502	August 24, 2019 11:33AM	stickguy	"it is something that has always been there, so people are used to it, but mostly it lets them advertise in big bold print a lower sticker price. With the * in fine print ""plus destination""."
2503	August 24, 2019 11:35AM	stickguy	I have not driven a Tiguan so can't comment on the performance, but I suspect it would be more than fine for her. Probably all she would notice is if it felt snappy off the line compared to the RDX.
2504	August 24, 2019 2:11PM	andres3	"I know it doesn't make complete sense, but my wife says she felt the 4-Motion helped the Tiguan seem peppier, lighter, and quicker to move and accelerate. It might be in the engine, throttle and transmission tuning taking advantage of extra traction.

It's not going to win drag races, but it seems adequate for an SUV. This from a VW website:

Inside every 2019 Volkswagen Tiguan is a turbocharged, four-cylinder, 2.0-liter engine connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission. This engine generates 184 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque

It's also tuned for 87 fuel. The 2.0T is a gem so if you have a need for more speed, simply get it tuned to Stage 1 and 91 octane and I'm sure you'll see major gains."

Not that I don't believe him, but I'm gonna take the unit apart myself, see what lies beneath. He said I could get a lamp for $35, but it's noted as a backup light. If indeed it's replace the whole unit, I think I've gotten to the point now of committing $ (next service in December is 6 year service, some wear items to replace, so likely $$$) to keep the XF or time for something newer and shinier.

Honestly, it would be tough to say adios to the cat, just everything about it makes me smile.

2524	August 24, 2019 7:55PM	ab348	Take a look at the opposite side in operation. A LED lamp has a much sharper on/off look than an incandescent bulb. That could save you the trouble of disassembling it.

2536	August 25, 2019 7:45PM	28firefighter	"Ok. Drove the Q5. No punch to report but I’m done shopping. This is what I want.

I won’t bore you with all the details I gave Friday, but as a reminder this was a 2015 with 36k miles - premium plus with tech package. Black over brown.

Car drove beautifully - even in regular drive mode the steering was tight and responsive, the suspension appropriately sporty without being punishing, and the transmission did a great job of keeping the car in the meat of its power band. As @sda mentioned, it will upshift for gas mileage, but I found that a moderate blip of the throttle and it downshifted easily. It was definitely more sluggish than say my GTI, but the AWD helped the handling immensely.

The B and O stereo is excellent, seats were supportive, and the interior just very upscale. This particular car was clearly well cared for, inside and out. No rattles, creaks or anything - I could be convinced it had half the mileage.

CarMax was asking $24,9 which isn’t cheap for a 2015. But what makes it worthwhile is that a 5 year B2B warranty extension out to 80k miles or so was only ~$2200. That’s half what the Audi dealer quoted me for a similar extension on a CPO car. That is the value proposition on a used ride like this.

Had I not had 4 more payments and a $350 dispo in front of me ($1500) I would have bought it, no question."

Their was a Bullitt at the local Acura dealer. My bride was underwhelmed, and I still think it is too big for my tastes(Jeep is the only domestic brand she actually likes). I'd go with a 370Z if the telematics weren't so ancient; I still like the car- I just don't know if I could live with it long term. I found a private seller offering an almost new RWD M240i I'd pick it up if it wasn't the same color as my M235i- it's a manual with sunroof delete and virtually every other option. Best of all, it already has the M Performance Differential, exhaust, and aerodynamics installed."

When I drove the Q5 I expected to like it, but came away impressed. My wife always mentioned she liked the Q5 so when I brought it home for her to drive, she asked for my opinion. I said drive it and let me know what you think, I didn’t want to color her opinion as it was going to be for her. She really liked it and gave two thumbs up. Your summary matches mine.

2551	August 26, 2019 2:16AM	benjaminh	Does a 2015 Audi Q5 have CarPlay/AndroidAuto?
2552	August 26, 2019 2:39AM	28firefighter	No - but it has Nav, the B&O stereo, and I can stream music to the stereo via their MMI interface. Gives me what I have now in the BMW and what I had in the Stelvio, which is more than adequate.

The ability to send texts is also useful, so that I can do things like say to my wife, ""I'm going with my friend to a movie. Back about 9"" or whatever. I also sometimes play my audio books in the car through Audible which is integrated into the app. I assume Apple's CarPlay has almost identical functionality. Anyway, I wouldn't consider getting a new or used car without CarPlay/AndroidAuto, but perhaps that's just me. Maybe you might consider trying to use a car with it to see if it's useful to you? Just a thought.

PS For anyone else who has AndroidAuto the new version is even better imho. For me it took a ""forced update"" for some reason to try it, but it's free and very good. Here's a 4-minute video from a guy who likes it too. He has an aftermarket unit for AndroidAuto, but I like it just built into the car."

AndroidAuto navigation: ""A-""

Built-in navigation: ""C-""

The built-in navigation is so cumbersome and awkward to use that really it seems more like a D to me. I only use it if I've forgotten my phone. But I used built-in navi a lot on my 2008 Accord, and it is available as a back-up in my 2018 TLX."

We dropped the Pilot off last night (to be serviced today) for an oil change, tire rotation, slow leak in the right rear tire, & squeaky left rear window. 31K miles so far. Those of you who have been paying attention know that means my wife gets the Q40 and I drive my Prelude. 2nd to 3rd upshift to merge on to 95 this AM was a thing of beauty. A couple of perfectly executed downshifts to slow down and get off the exit. Traffic was light. I had the sunroof open. Man, I gotta test drive an Accord Sport 2.0 6MT or a Civic Si Sedan. We'll see how things go on the way home.

I do miss it though. Eventually a toy will be the Solution!"
2563	August 26, 2019 12:53PM	tjc78	It was a nice ride this morning. Cool and sunny. I had the sunroof open too and took the non-highway route into the office. Opened up the new machine a few times, it's deceptively quick. I have trouble believing it's a 4cyl.
2564	August 26, 2019 1:19PM	stickguy	Even my TLX with only 206 HP Is deceptively quick. I’m a big fan of the 2.0t engines. As much power as I’ll ever need, and still can get good MPG cruising.

2570	August 26, 2019 2:12PM	nyccarguy	I agree. Much like my Prelude, the 2010 TSX we had with the 2.0 was a GEM of an engine. Deceptively fast is a good way to describe it. The last time I got stopped for speeding was in that TSX. I was clocked at 82 in a 55 & was going MUCH faster before I saw the trooper & hit the brakes. That was March 10, 2010 for those of you keeping score.
2571	August 26, 2019 2:14PM	nyccarguy	My wife doesn't drive stick. We switch cars often enough that it would be an issue.
2572	August 26, 2019 2:27PM	stickguy	Tom, 300 HP is still gonna be thirstier around town. And I never trust the first tank, especially since usually a lot of idling at the dealer. I would be curious what you get on an extended highway run though.
2573	August 26, 2019 2:28PM	tjc78	"We switch cars often enough that it would be an issue.

Sounds like my wife and I. We really do share the cars, it's also great in my case since we can spread the miles out a bit. She is only a 10 mile round trip to the train."

2575	August 26, 2019 5:29PM	tjc78	"Yes, first tank is usually terrible on any vehicle.

I'm not expecting much, and in all reality I'd be happy with averaging 20 with my commute. It's rated 21/32 so on a highway run 30 should be attainable.

I also really don't like start/stop so I turned it off in the configuration menu. Much to my surprise it stays off between starts."
2576	August 26, 2019 5:57PM	carnaught	@tjc78, does the S60 require PUG?

2578	August 26, 2019 6:07PM	tjc78	Yep, premium it is. The owner's manual says 93 (91 min) for the T5 too, but like you said I'd bet it's fine on 87.
2579	August 26, 2019 6:14PM	stickguy	I saw it on Volvo’s website. Possibly it changed for the new model. And something I really want to avoid! Pretty sure the TLX will be fine with regular, but so far I compromised and always use mid grade. Our 2000 TL used that and ran great at 175,000 miles when I sold it!
2580	August 26, 2019 6:59PM	pensfan83	"Two weeks with the Tacoma and 400 miles. It's been mainly driven by me but my wife has also driven it with no problems. No complaints so far other than the brakes seem a little grabby and looking closer there are more hard surfaces than soft but the materials and fit/finish are very good and visually it looks really good I think. It's already hauled home a new grille and been used for baseball practice with nothing needed but a quick rinse of the bed with the hose instead of the wet/dry vac for the trunk. Oh and remember how I said I wished the Acura had more USB ports? This thing has three(!) so we're set for any road trips, which I expect we'll split between this and the Acura depending on the destination.

As for the manual transmission, that's what initially halted the plan to get a Tacoma until I agreed it would be an automatic, which was fine with me. I still have the Prelude and experience the same joy as @nyccarguy does with his, it's such a fun car. I'm probably going to drive that more frequently since it will go into storage in roughly 2.5 months."
2581	August 26, 2019 7:08PM	benjaminh	You probably know this, but TLX's 2.4 isn't a turbo. But from my pov that's maybe a good thing, because I like the engine sound better than almost all turbos, plus it's likely to last longer with fewer repairs if kept long-term.
2582	August 27, 2019 12:52AM	xwesx	Same is true on the tails for my Q7. I purchased a replacement from RockAuto; was about $350. Not thrilling, but needed it. Replacement is identical to original, right down to the stamping. Mine was mechanical damage (cover had a small chunk that broke out, allowing water, algae, etc, inside it), but it is a non-serviceable LED unit. Replacement was simple and took about 45 minutes.
2583	August 27, 2019 12:55AM	xwesx	Excellent! You know, I have a Q7 that you could get for less, just as lux, better ride, better economy.... I'll even deliver!
2584	August 27, 2019 12:58AM	xwesx	That... that really isn't even fair.
2585	August 27, 2019 1:03AM	corvette	I saw where VW is CPO-ing the fixed TDI vehicles and it looks like they get a 2-year, unlimited mileage warranty. I'm seeing asking prices starting around $10k for Passats. Not bad for someone who will rack up a lot of miles during that two year period.
2586	August 27, 2019 1:03AM	xwesx	My wife is the opposite: She doesn't like driving my cars because they are automatics. It's a good problem for her to have, IMO.
2587	August 27, 2019 1:10AM	ab348	It appears to be an easy DIY job according to this video:
2588	August 27, 2019 1:13AM	andres3	"Hey, my '15 A4 resembles that remark, while my old S4 resembles the former.

To be honest, the extra 100+ horses wasn't much of a weight or fuel economy penalty given the more efficient 7-speed DSG transmission. At least, that's what I'm noticing so far. But I drive in a way that gets the horses working, your mileage may vary."
2589	August 27, 2019 1:13AM	stickguy	"had to go do a home visit for the dog rescue tonight, and there was a Telluride in the driveway. We got chatting about it, and the couple was gushing about how wonderful it was, and feature packed and good value. She said that it was the first one (I think in NJ, or maybe at the dealer) so they were definitely early adopters!

I actually did that once. The Scion tC I got was the first one delivered in the region (I know that for sure, might have been state also). It was the first one that they dealership had actually seen."
2590	August 27, 2019 1:17AM	stickguy	"and on the drive (probably about 50 miles RT, a mix of local, some highway at varying speeds, them some more local) the TLX, according to the TC, averaged just a tick under 35. Seems like the mileage has improved as it got broken in. Pretty impressive for the driving (I did exercise it a bit when I had the chance). Plus was alone, so had the moonroof open, and pink floyd cranking on the way home!

Car really drives nicely. excellent mix of quiet comfort on the highway, and fun to drive on the back roads. I think the A spec specifics (wider tires and suspension tweaks) really add to the sporty aspect. And deceptively quick. Still a bit bigger than I really prefer, but excellent car all around. More people should buy these!"
2591	August 27, 2019 1:19AM	stickguy	that would have been perfect for my daughter. She ended up moving back up this way so her 2 year engagement at her development program in Delaware is going to end up racking close to 50k miles on her car. A cheap CPO with unlimited miles, and excellent MPG, would have been just the ticket to buy, use heavily, then dump it at the end. Cheaper than leasing!
2592	August 27, 2019 1:20AM	andres3	First things first. A couple of pics of the new to me '15 A4 after getting all cleaned up for the first time since delivery.
2593	August 27, 2019 1:25AM	stickguy	is that the dark blue, or black? Either way very sharp looking. I always thought the generation A4 was a perfect size and classy design.
2594	August 27, 2019 1:29AM	28firefighter	"Watched some reviews of the Legacy XT today. Consensus seems to be that the engine packs a ton of punch - more than it probably needs given how the steering and suspension are tuned.

I’m intrigued to drive it - interior looks seriously upgraded."
2595	August 27, 2019 1:36AM	andres3	"It's the midnight blue, which might as well be called black with blue sprinkles of metallic. It is about as dark as a blue can get, without being mistaken for black 100% of the time.

Similar to black, it looks great when it's clean and shiny!

It does soak up the heat though, my next car needs to be lighter, without being white or gray."
2596	August 27, 2019 1:36AM	stickguy	looks like a Volvo to me.
2597	August 27, 2019 1:39AM	breld	"Okay, one step in our reallocation of overall debt - increase house debt, decrease car debt.

Q7 is out, wife got the Alltrack she has pined for, and I take over the A5 Sportback to go with the GTI.

A few poor quality pictures. I’ll get some better ones when the two Golfs are sharing space."
2598	August 27, 2019 1:44AM	andres3	"I see I was too late with my post. Either way, congrats! I imagine the manual was more important than avoiding a black interior, which would be triply hard to do with a manual.

Enjoy; the Alltrack is truly a great VW. Still think the engine needs Stage 1 tuning to come alive.

Those wheels are one of my favorite all-time set of OEM wheels! I even explored buying them separate!

Vroom or Carvana? Is it a '17 or 18 or '19?"
2599	August 27, 2019 1:44AM	stickguy	"sharp looking. Seems to be a run on that color VW this week! I could live with that.

Hope the fleet stays intact at least until the end of the year."
2600	August 27, 2019 1:44AM	stickguy	oh, is that brand new or slightly used?
2601	August 27, 2019 1:46AM	pensfan83	Nice @breld!
2602	August 27, 2019 1:55AM	nyccarguy	"Lookin good @andres3 ! That midnight blue is a very pretty color. Lots of depth in the sunlight.

@breld - excellent job as always! Quiet for the year so far, but then pinching your card twice with authority! Love your GTI & your wife has good taste as well!"
2603	August 27, 2019 1:58AM	breld	"So it's a new 2019 Alltrack. Would have been happy to buy used, but would have wanted at least a 2018 for the warranty, a manual was a must, and the SEL was strongly desired. So...not too many options.

We've been eyeing inventory for awhile, and this dealership has had several of them (SEL Manuals), they were down to 3 of them, one of them being the Silk Blue my wife likes.

They were pricing them pretty aggressively to start with, but ended up offering a bit extra, and the sales manager was extremely thoughtful in offering the trade on the Q7 (meaning, he was familiar with Audi's, valued the upgraded wheels and adaptive suspension, and was very transparent on how he arrived at the value). They offered about a grand higher than expected (based on Q's assessment) and about $5,500 off the Alltrack, so we were very happy."
2604	August 27, 2019 2:00AM	28firefighter	Mercy mercy you folks move fast! Nice choice though - if that thing had a bit more kick (legally, without a tune), I think I'd be all over it.
2605	August 27, 2019 2:05AM	mjfloyd1	So much for the “punch free” year ...😂

2607	August 27, 2019 2:07AM	mjfloyd1	Tunes are legal, you just trash your drivetrain warranty
2608	August 27, 2019 2:09AM	corvette	I would look into whether Jaguar revised/improved the part before buying a used one. VW went through several revisions of brake light switches and window regulators on the first Jetta I had.
2609	August 27, 2019 2:16AM	28firefighter	In the 28FF house of german vehicle ownership, you can rest assured that whatever the tune would ruin in terms of warranty is exactly what will break 48 hours after I do it.
2610	August 27, 2019 2:16AM	corvette	breld, nice! What is the P + steering wheel button? If it has parking assist with a manual transmission, I'm really impressed. Also, is that a 2019 or 2020?
2611	August 27, 2019 2:19AM	benjaminh	I like it. With the 6-year warranty might be a good choice. A unicorn.
2612	August 27, 2019 2:21AM	stickguy	sharp looking wagon FF. I would not mind having it, but no way I could sell that to the wife as an upgrade for her!
2613	August 27, 2019 2:22AM	andres3	"Unless you find a ""don't ask don't tell"" dealership service guy."
2614	August 27, 2019 2:32AM	28firefighter	It’s slow without a tune. And I won’t tune it.
2615	August 27, 2019 2:37AM	andres3	Can't argue with that. Europe might have something called an Alltrack R. Lobby for the States to get it.
2616	August 27, 2019 2:44AM	corvette	RIP, Ferdinand Piech. Looks like he was involved in some capacity with VWAG at the time all four of the VW/Audi products I've owned were produced.
2617	August 27, 2019 2:57AM	laurasdada	"Thanks for all the Jag tail light help! I've done similar research, found inexpensive used units and videos on replacement. New OEM replacement is going to be expensive, no surprise. So, I just have to decide to invest more $ into the XF and keep it a bit longer, or move on.

I know I'm a broken record, but since I need a somewhat sensible pair of shoes, nothing really turns me on at the moment as far as a replacement. There are plenty of desirable cars out there, in the ~$50k range, but I'm not moved. I should definitely test drive a few, of course. That may change my mind!"
2618	August 27, 2019 3:06AM	breld	"We saw that as well and don't know for sure - we'll have to look it up, but I assume it's a parking assist function as you suggest.

Not entirely sure how that and the adaptive cruise control works with a manual trannie.

And it's a 2019 - last year for the wagons."
2619	August 27, 2019 12:37PM	benjaminh	Congrats!! Amazingly rare AWD station wagon with a 6-speed manual.
2620	August 27, 2019 12:41PM	coldinohio	congrats on the new VW and Audi...
2621	August 27, 2019 2:01PM	graphicguy	@andres3 and @breld.....well done. Congrats to you both!
2622	August 27, 2019 2:05PM	fintail	Nice color on that wagon, I wish MB hadn't virtually discontinued lighter blues in this market anyway.
2623	August 27, 2019 2:14PM	au1994	Didn't see this one coming but thats a very nice wagon.
2624	August 27, 2019 4:40PM	mjfloyd1	That works fine for routine service but if you have a drivetrain issue and they hook up to your OBD2 port, it’s a TD1 - bye bye drivetrain warranty

2630	August 27, 2019 7:01PM	stickguy	I’m getting really antsy to just trade the RDX in soon and upgrade the wife’s ride. Then just deal with my car when the lease ends. Save me the trouble of selling it then, when I don’t feel like driving a 10 YO car!
2631	August 27, 2019 7:22PM	pensfan83	Is the offer from Carvana still valid?
2632	August 27, 2019 7:35PM	stickguy	"It was for a week. Might have expired. It’s my wife’s car and we haven’t even looked yet or made decision to move forward, so I will be in big trouble if I sell it on her!

Actually, I can’t. Title is in her name.

Plan is, if she sells OK to by, and we find what we want,I’ll get a refreshed quote."
2633	August 27, 2019 8:11PM	laurasdada	I like the cargurus site, but at a minimum surf it and cars.com when daydreaming...
2634	August 27, 2019 8:42PM	stickguy	"Actually sorry I missed this one. Could have swapped this one for exactly $10k, plus tax and moving over plates. Short term loan, that would be done the same time as my lease, at which time I’d inherit the Volvo, wife gets a new whatever she wants!

2637	August 27, 2019 9:46PM	xwesx	Very practical move! Looks nice, too, and definitely the best transmission choice.

2640	August 28, 2019 12:27AM	stickguy	"showed the CC to my wife. ""I don't want a wagon"" Followed by me explaining it is a cross country CUV. Unfortunately, in the listing they call it a CC wagon! I might lose this battle, but would need to get our out to look in person."
2641	August 28, 2019 12:58AM	suydam	So she doesn’t like it, move on!
2642	August 28, 2019 1:07AM	28firefighter	This
2643	August 28, 2019 1:13AM	stickguy	"I don't give up that easy! Just need to work the ""'it's for me"" angle. She just gets to drive it for a couple of years until I am ready."
2644	August 28, 2019 1:14AM	stickguy	If I have to give up on this dream, so be it. Just makes me worried about selling her on the OB.
2645	August 28, 2019 1:14AM	28firefighter	OB comes across a lot differently, to me, than the V60. Semantics, I realize.
2646	August 28, 2019 1:15AM	qbrozen	Ah. Good to know. Guess I’ll have to try the direct approach.
2647	August 28, 2019 1:50AM	suydam	Hmmm. I thought this was going to be her vehicle. Didn’t you get one already?
2648	August 28, 2019 2:03AM	stickguy	"My next vehicle. when the TLX lease is up, she gets the new one, and I get the old one. I was just going to upgrade that car early, but she would drive it the next couple years.

so RDX becomes the V60. She drives Volvo. In 2 years I get the Volvo, tlx does away, and she gets a new car.

only thing that changes from the current plan is that she drives a nicer car the next 2 years! Seems like a win-win to me."
2649	August 28, 2019 2:19AM	benjaminh	In c. 2.5 years when the lease on your TLX is up you'll be able to buy your TLX for c.$20k. Given how little you drive it'll probably only have 15,000 or so miles on it, and so it'll be in close to mint condition. Do you really think you'll be able to find a better car for 20k than your own babied A-spec TLX in that great color combination? As you've said, it's kind of a Goldilocks car with good handling, very nice engine and transmission, luxurious interior, great features, and highway mpg of 35+. What is your TLX lacking that you are looking for? The greater cargo space of a wagon? More power?
2650	August 28, 2019 2:23AM	stickguy	"more like 25K miles probably.

will likely be ready for a change, and looking for something taller with more sidewall!

could end up keeping it of course, but not likely to want to buy that out at the same time as getting something fancy and new for the wife. That was the point of keeping the old, paid off car. Otherwise, 2 payments again. If we are willing to do that, might as well do it now!

actually, if I did plan to keep the TLX, we absolutely would be looking to trade out the RDX now while the value is still high. No real reason to keep it if it is just temporary anyway.

once the school loan is paid off, more likely to do something."
2651	August 28, 2019 2:30AM	benjaminh	If she doesn't want a wagon my guess is that the Outback is going to be a tough sell.
2652	August 28, 2019 2:36AM	benjaminh	"Right now I think I want to buy out my TLX. But 2 years is a long time in the car biz, and I'm wondering if Acura has an cool electric car with a full federal rebate of $7500 in July of 2021 if that might somehow work financially. Today's NY Times says that Cadillac is planning to add electric vehicles to compete with Tesla in the next few years, and I'm guessing Acura will do the same.

2654	August 28, 2019 3:09AM	rny421	"Rental Car Review:
VW Atlas SE AWD. I reserved an Intermediate Car, but they upgraded me to the Atlas, as that was all they had. Long story short I’m unimpressed.

The Good: This thing is huge, but it doesn’t drive as big as it is. The touchscreen interface is pretty good and the controls are easily laid out. It got decent gas mileage for what it is.

The bad: It feels quick off the line, but when you really need it, like in a merging situation, it feels gutless. The auto stop is one of the worst I’ve experienced. It lurches the car forward, almost like someone who’s learning to drive stick. The interior materials are hard, and build quality is questionable. During my 5.5 hour road trip, the door panels rattled as I listened to certain songs at regular volume, which drove me nuts. The turn signals integrated in the side mirrors are poorly designed, because you can see them when driving, and they can be confused with the blind spot indicator, constantly making you do a double take.

Unless you got it for pennies on the dollar, I see no reason to go with this over the competition like the Explorer, Pilot, Telluride, etc."

Not dark green, THAT green. Subtle it is not. After dinner, he let me drive home. I can really see the appeal of these Jeeps. It was a beautiful summer night, on the chilly side. We had the soft top down and the windows up. I was impressed. The 37” tires are a little much for my tastes & you can feel their weight when you brake & turn. Besides that, it was a nice, solid ride. I’d definitely take a look at one of these at some point.

He took it Off Roading somewhere in PA and said it was incredible. He even said the ride wasn’t that bad getting there, but after a full day of off roading and then a 3 hour drive home he said it was rough."
2657	August 28, 2019 3:41AM	stickguy	A Wrangler, that I know will never be on our list! I think that list is going to be much shorter. maybe I can sell the OB, if not, might have to just wait longer until have the money for a new RDX! At least in a year or 2 there might be some CPOs.
2658	August 28, 2019 5:07AM	breld	"@rny421 - interesting write up on the Atlas. Thanks for sharing.

2662	August 28, 2019 11:41AM	ab348	@rny421 - Thanks for that assessment of the Atlas. When it was introduced, replacing the Touraeg at a much lower price point, I thought VW would sell a boatload of them, but I have not seen many on the roads here. Turns out it is far different from the Touraeg in both engineering and materials quality. I think VW will need to do a major refresh on it and improve the engine and materials before it can take off.

My wife hates all parts of the process and wants nothing to do with it. With the Volvo she couldn't care less other than knowing what it cost. When I told her we had to drive 90 minutes to get it, she was less than thrilled.

She has admitted to enjoying driving it, but I think she still prefers the Enclave.... which is why late next year I'll probably just get her another one."
2666	August 28, 2019 12:21PM	au1994	Nice write up on the Atlas and unfortunately confirms what I suspected. You’d have to opt for the top model to enjoy. As good as the 2.0 is, I bet the Atlas is a dog with that motor.
2667	August 28, 2019 12:33PM	stickguy	"my wife gets a little interested, at least when it is for her! And is OK going to look when we are really in the market (like when a lease is coming to the end). She does not enjoy just looking because we are going by the dealer, and they have something i just want to scope out.

she absolutely wants to test drive and evaluate the car (and color options) if it is for her. But wants no part of the shopping process, once she says what she wants. I get to do that and just tell her when we are going to pick it up!

if it is my car, she is perfectly happy to let me do it all and surprise her, as long as she had a chance to sit in the passengers seat at some point, and I keep her general opinions in mind. the car show is actually great for that, since can see just about everything in a pressure free environment.

It's been awhile, but earlier this year you had made a very well informed suggestion for wheel spacers on our A5 to accommodate the A4 wheels we purchased for our winter wheel set.

I just placed the order for those spacers from ECS, and I would have had a much tougher time without your input.

Looking forward to putting on the winter wheel set in a couple months and having them look a bit more proper. Thanks!"
2670	August 28, 2019 4:29PM	tifighter	My wife hates all parts of the car-buying process, and prefers that I just deal with all of it. She went with me once maybe five years ago, and was mortified by the back and forth on just getting a trade value. She has never wanted to participate since. Funny enough, the Tesla process is perfect for people like her, but she sat that one out too. Loves the car, though.
2671	August 28, 2019 4:49PM	nyccarguy	"Loves the car, though

That makes it all worth it"
2672	August 28, 2019 5:04PM	Michaell	"My wife used to participate in the process, but not so much anymore.

On the Outback, we plunked down $500 to reserve the color she wanted, that was coming in from the factory. I did all the research and did the negotiating on my own; she joined me afterwards to sign paperwork.

The Jetta I just returned was my deal, start to finish. Her name wasn't on the paperwork.

Speaking of which, got the bill for the disposition fee - $350 + tax."
2673	August 28, 2019 5:11PM	28firefighter	My wife wants to participate in the process to the extent she wants to drive her options. She also knows that sometimes what we end up with may be #2 or #3 on her list, if it hits a lower price point. In the case of the Outback, I gave her a range of what the lease could be, and when I told her it was available for less than that - she jumped.
2674	August 28, 2019 5:27PM	Michaell	"Agreed on that, too. No way would my wife allow me to pick her DD without at least a test drive.

One of the odd tendencies my wife has is to test the turning radius. I really don't know why, because it's not something she does a lot of in her normal driving."
2675	August 28, 2019 5:28PM	tjc78	"The Jetta I just returned was my deal, start to finish. Her name wasn't on the paperwork.


My wife hasn't been on a car since her 2008 Elantra she bought right before we started dating."

2677	August 28, 2019 5:31PM	pensfan83	Same here, test drives are the extent of our combined involvement. Once we decide on a vehicle the negotiation process is entirely on me to handle, she just shows up to sign the paperwork.
2678	August 28, 2019 5:35PM	ab348	That's cold, man.
2679	August 28, 2019 5:37PM	28firefighter	We keep one car in her name and the others in mine - the reason being that I want her to continue to maintain a strong credit history. Having an auto loan or lease is a part of it.
2680	August 28, 2019 5:38PM	28firefighter	I still feel like a part of me is missing not having seen him buy a car.
2681	August 28, 2019 5:40PM	thebean	Only joking. It’s fun to do that occasionally. 👍
2682	August 28, 2019 5:40PM	Michaell	We are both on the Outback.
2683	August 28, 2019 6:19PM	xwesx	"My wife says she doesn't want to have anything to do with car buying, maintenance, etc., but then she tries to make me feel guilty about ""doing everything for her."" No worries here; my give a damn broke a long, long time ago."
2684	August 28, 2019 6:34PM	tifighter	"My wife takes awhile to adjust to a new car, so test drives aren't that illuminating for her. Plus I tend to be more critical about cars, so it sorta works out. After I drove test drove the 3 and really liked it, her input was basically ""okay, can we get it in blue?""

Funny enough, we have only had two cars she ever cared about. First was our Miata (06 GT PRHT) which was blue with that caramel leather interior. Pretty easy car to like. And now the 3, which is more fun than I think she imagined. She recently said that she thinks she looks good in it, so that is basically the gold seal of approval. Might be hard to get out of this one..."
2685	August 28, 2019 6:56PM	thebean	You haven’t missed anything. I bet he’s still driving the ‘11 Soul. 😄
2686	August 28, 2019 7:10PM	stickguy	"If for her, my wife wants to test drive to make sure she likes it and pick out the color. That’s it. One car is always in her name, the other in mine. But not always the one we drive.

And bean, I think you were being mean, but I’ll let it slide. Not likely catching me in a Kia dealer, though the telluride is very nice. I’m just not shopping in that jumbo size class. And at least, I do eventually buy something!"
2687	August 28, 2019 7:12PM	stickguy	Oh, and once it’s home, she wants me to do everything. Gas it up, wash it, service, etc. she just wants to drive it.
2688	August 28, 2019 7:41PM	benjaminh	"I sometimes get gas for my wife and get her car washed too. And like some others here, she wants to be involved in the buying process as little as possible. Once she said she liked the new CR-V, I found a good deal with the color that was her favorite. I did ask her to come down and test drive it before I signed all the paperwork. But once she drove it and liked it, I told her she could take off while I did the paperwork, which ended up being another couple of hours. But she's told me several times how much she loves her car, which makes me glad I got exactly what she wanted.

But back to your challenge. Do you think that she could somehow see the Subaru Outback as an SUV rather than a station wagon? If so, the Outback really does seem like a good alternative in terms of performance, luxury, features, and price. But if it's still just a station wagon to her, maybe the RDX is still a possibility? Since she's had her current RDX for 6+ years it certainly seems like she's gotten a lot out of it in that time. What kind of miles are on her RDX?

I'm a believer in the new auto technologies like CarPlay/AndroidAuto, adaptive cruise, etc, and it seems like for her long commute they might be useful...."
2689	August 28, 2019 7:59PM	tjc78	"If someone doesn't want a wagon, the Outback (no matter how nice it is) is a tough sell.

@stickguy
Get her behind the wheel of a new RDX and I'd bet she would be willing to pull the trigger."
2690	August 28, 2019 8:04PM	au1994	"Good assessment of the Jeep. I’ve only ridden in a JL and while improved over the JK (which was light years ahead of the TJ) you still know your in a Jeep. And that’s not a bad thing. The appeal is very strong and that’s why in my area the resale is incredible. Truly better off just buying new in most cases. The 37’s wouldn’t be my choice but wouldn’t mind a mild lift and tire combo. I love them, my wife loves them and of course the 13 year old LOVE’s them. My problem is practicality. It’s still too rough around the edges to be my wife’s DD. They don’t particularly haul a lot of stuff well, even the UnLTD wouldn’t tow the boat and with the soft top (my preference) you have to be very conscious about what you carry with you and the mpg is about what you would expect from pushing a brick through the wind.

But I still want one..."
2691	August 28, 2019 8:15PM	Michaell	"The reason we have an Outback was because the wife wanted something more ""wagon-y"". At the time, the only choices were the Outback and XC70. Outback was more than $10k cheaper."
2692	August 28, 2019 8:35PM	stickguy	"We’ve driven the RDX. No question she likes it. Depends though how $$ she likes it!

I’ll try to sell the outback. Cheaper, better mileage on regular gas (I really want to avoid PUG required), and I bet the tech will be easier to use. She gets intimidated by my car, and that doesn’t have a track pad or push button shifter! But need to drive it first.

The current RDX turns 7 in 1-2 weeks. I think it’s sitting right about at 57k miles."
2693	August 28, 2019 8:40PM	thebean	@stickguy, I apologize if you thought I was being mean. I was really just trying to catch up to @jmonroe1 in the LOL category. I really do think iluv is still driving that Soul he had when he was on here.

2701	August 29, 2019 12:47AM	jpp75	I just had an Outback for a rental up in Boston, I can definitely see the appeal. This was a lower optioned model but had Eyesight which I loved. The 4 cyl was more than adequate although I get the love for the outgoing 3.6R. The CVT wasn't bad, but I didn't love it either, however for an all around does everything right car it's hard to beat.
2702	August 29, 2019 1:40AM	sda	Has anyone heard from our friend Henryn from Houston lately?

2705	August 29, 2019 1:42AM	stickguy	I do love the new style V60.. The snazzy interior might be an easier sell. Need to show her one. the problem with that is, the prices are still way too high. Maybe 2 years from now? But if spending that kind of money, might just get another Acura.
2706	August 29, 2019 9:17AM	ronsteve	"My wife didn't want to be part of my most recent car buying process either. I brought her in at the very last bit to give her veto power over the color, as what I had found was potentially controversial. Fortunately Acura's Kona Coffee Metallic is one of the nicer brown colors you'll find on a car, so it passed. Had I seen a white car, I would have been looking for a different copy, and if I had seen black with tan interior I wouldn't have even taken her in.

Now we're at 11 months and 1 day and she still hasn't yet driven it. I had planned to hand off to her on part of our trip to St Louis this past weekend, but a gator-gagger of a storm over Illinois made me think better of that. Our November trip to Richmond (about 8 hrs driving time) may be her first time behind the wheel of Obi-Wan. I'm enough of a troglodyte that I usually let the ""targeting computer"" (Nav display) turn itself off but it hasn't yet told me to ""Use the Force, Luke."""
2707	August 29, 2019 10:04AM	tjc78	My wife is the opposite with the Volvo. I have barely driven it and it’s supposed to be my car. I’m stuck with the bus (Enclave).
2708	August 29, 2019 1:13PM	stickguy	"Speaking of the wife, she texts last night “my car needs gas”. Then she forgets to stop on way home from dinner, so it’s 9:30 by the time she remembers to tell me, and I’m not going out then. So I took it out before breakfast since I’m up first. Light was on, RTE sitting at 30 something. I really hate when she does that! So ran to ConocoPhillips to fill up. As a bonus when I got home, I cleaned the front and rear windows since they were filthy.

I spoil her! Must be genetic, because daughter is bringer her Jetta over Sunday for a “spa day”"
2709	August 29, 2019 1:15PM	corvette	I can’t post pictures from my phone, but I just got a Carvana ad on Facebook advertising a 2014 FJ Cruiser with 78,000 miles for $27,700. What did those sell for new? Seems high for a two door 4Runner with worse visibility.
2710	August 29, 2019 1:18PM	stickguy	"As to shopping, I mentioned this AM something about how if that V60 CC had not been taken, it would probably be getting delivered tomorrow. Then I showed her some pretty colored Tiguans. She said “I don’t want a Tiguan, I want an RDX”

She’s stubborn, but I still got some tricks up my sleeve."
2711	August 29, 2019 1:46PM	graphicguy	I’m guessing, he still hasn’t, but IS STILL scheming a way to BS his wife to get permission to buy a used Sentra.

2713	August 29, 2019 1:50PM	graphicguy	Is it just me or do you ever want to say to ALEX ON AUTOS....”just get to the point, please!!!!!!”
2714	August 29, 2019 1:50PM	qbrozen	They became somewhat of a collector's item for some strange reason. One of those vehicles they couldn't give away when new but now everyone wants. And, yes, they are that expensive.
2715	August 29, 2019 1:58PM	stickguy	About an hour from Bradd.
2716	August 29, 2019 1:58PM	28firefighter	Only during every review.
2717	August 29, 2019 1:59PM	nyccarguy	It is about an hour from me (in a direction that I don't normally travel). PM me if you don't want to make the details public.
2718	August 29, 2019 2:01PM	fintail	That's about the end of the run for those, probably pretty rare. IIRC the later ones are improved over the earlier model years - not requiring premium at least. They've always had insane resale as were trendy in some markets (like where I am), and it'll no doubt be snapped up by an urban adventurer using it for the tough roads between the faceless office campus and generic townhouse development.
2719	August 29, 2019 2:18PM	qbrozen	"Oh, I can't make you drive an hour.

It would be so much easier if these dealers would just respond to requests."
2720	August 29, 2019 2:32PM	ab348	That seems like pretty clear direction from where I sit. Use those tricks at your peril.
2721	August 29, 2019 2:34PM	suydam	Not me. If it’s a vehicle I’m thinking about I like the detail. Besides, there’s a fast forward button at the bottom.

2726	August 29, 2019 3:33PM	pensfan83	I enjoy reading how all of us go about buying a car differently, some operate in stealth mode, for some it's like watching a Netflix documentary, and others playing a game of Clue.
2727	August 29, 2019 3:33PM	stickguy	Well, she’s not an expert. My job is to determine the best option all around for us, for the next 10 years (cost up front and ongoing, functionality, etc.). Then convince her it was her idea all along.
2728	August 29, 2019 3:37PM	tjc78	"I almost always gas up the cars too. I'm not sure what the big deal is.... this is Jersey we don't even have to get out of the car.

The Volvo was at 60 miles to empty on Monday. Wife has had for three days now. She only drives 10 miles a day so theoretically it still has some in the tank. I'm curious if she will fill it tonight or leave it to me. I've already told her it gets Premium but have a sneaky suspicion she will put regular in it not thinking."
2729	August 29, 2019 3:41PM	qbrozen	Just trying to make it a surprise. LOL
2730	August 29, 2019 3:47PM	stickguy	"Well, I have been told I’m supposed to keep you all entertained, so doing my best.

But yeah, the different styles are interesting."
2731	August 29, 2019 3:48PM	pensfan83	Oh no, please do....I didn't mean that in a bad way for anyone, it's entertaining to follow.
2732	August 29, 2019 3:49PM	pensfan83	The jig will be up if we start seeing him steer Mrs. Stick to Nissan dealers, haha.
2733	August 29, 2019 3:52PM	qbrozen	"I’m not sure any of us could truly surprise the board. I mean, we have all made our preferences pretty clear over the years.

I had someone reach out about the bimmer. Awaiting a follow-up. I’m a bit surprised it wasn’t snatched up fast given the far worse 2019 deals right now. But maybe the accident history is holding it back."
2734	August 29, 2019 3:55PM	tjc78	If it doesn't go on LH, throw it on SAL with a $1000 DP... it will be gone quickly.
2735	August 29, 2019 3:55PM	corvette	I was in NJ a few moths ago and filled up my own tank. Whoops! The attendant didn’t say anything.
2736	August 29, 2019 3:56PM	tjc78	"Whereabouts?

If Wawa is really busy I'll do my own... they generally don't like you doing it."
2737	August 29, 2019 4:01PM	qbrozen	You mean for them to give me $1k, I hope? Haha.
2738	August 29, 2019 4:02PM	pensfan83	"That's true.

As for the BMW, since it's a lease I don't know what would hold someone back. It was repaired near perfectly, there's no DV concerns, and it's only someone's problem for what, another 12 months before BMWFS has to worry about it."
2739	August 29, 2019 4:11PM	ab348	"10 years?!?

That's the most entertaining thing you've posted yet!"
2740	August 29, 2019 4:12PM	tjc78	Yes absolutely. Your payment is too low for SAL! No reason someone less savvy than here or LH wouldn’t jump on a sub $400 3 series with $1000 OOP.
2741	August 29, 2019 4:12PM	corvette	"Somewhere off Mt. Pleasant avenue in Morris Plains.

Fortunately, it’s not necessary that they like me, just that I get a full tank."
2742	August 29, 2019 4:13PM	tjc78	Dead serious... if I hadn’t just signed the Volvo I probably would have taken it off your hands... Even with the black interior lol
2743	August 29, 2019 4:16PM	28firefighter	100% agree. Also cough up the $5 to list it on your local CL, too.
2744	August 29, 2019 4:26PM	pensfan83	Someone who's really in the know would also realize that's a cheap and easy way to get loyalty incentives for the next one.
2745	August 29, 2019 4:29PM	stickguy	"10 years is the target. That was the deal with the current RDX. We were shopping in a more ""budget friendly"" range (like CRV), and I made the mistake of stopping at the Acura dealer next door just to check the new design out since I had not seen one in person. Whoops. She really liked it, and after that, anything cheaper just fell short, so we bit the bullet. But she had to promise she would keep it for 10 years. About to turn 7 so did pretty good, and it would likely not go anywhere if I didn't have a new car already.

so either it gets traded to cash out the equity, or she keeps driving it for another 2 years and change taking it just over 9.

if we get another fancy car with a price that will make my cold, puritan heart shrivel up even more, it will need to be around a long time. So long term ownership needs to be a consideration, one reason I like the Subaru.

I have now cut the ""short"" list down from 9 to 6, arbitrarily eliminating the Q5, Tiguan and Lexus NX. Just because it is my list, and I can do it."
2746	August 29, 2019 5:33PM	thebean	@stickguy, have you read the consumer reviews on Edmunds on the ‘19 RDX? Lots of serious complaints about the infotainment system not operating as it should. Also a few about abrupt shifting and other tranny issues. These may be ironed out on the ‘20 models, but you never know. Food for thought.
2747	August 29, 2019 5:55PM	jmonroe1	"C'mon man, you don't have to be nice. The name of the game in here is to get a punch.

2748	August 29, 2019 6:03PM	stickguy	"I have heard some stuff along those lines. I know a poster here has one in the family (sister maybe) that had problems with the interface. One reason waiting a bit is a good idea, so they can iron out the bugs. And if there are still ongoing issues it could be enough to come off the list. Plenty of other options for spending too much money!

We did drive one but the wife just focused on driving. She would have to play with the features a bit to see if she would be comfortable with it."
2749	August 29, 2019 6:09PM	pensfan83	The RDX still doesn't offer AA either despite Acura's pledge it would be available after launch. Lots of displeased people on Acurazine and other forums.
2750	August 29, 2019 6:21PM	au1994	Sorry, obviously having a senior moment...AA?

2752	August 29, 2019 6:21PM	28firefighter	AA = Android Auto (in this context)
2753	August 29, 2019 6:23PM	xwesx	Just be dramatic about it and tell her that if she doesn't put in premium, she risks ruining the engine, and you'll take her key away....
2754	August 29, 2019 6:25PM	xwesx	Not sure why the history would be a problem. It is a lease, right? So, that should be of no significance to the next leasee, particularly since they didn't own the car when it happened (it's always harder to accept when it's your car that gets smacked).
2755	August 29, 2019 6:27PM	xwesx	Did that in Oregon a while back. A couple times, actually. The first time, I just didn't think about it. The second time, I waited for several minutes without service, so I just did it myself. That time, the guy was really angry about it when he did come out as I was finishing up. Poor sap.
2756	August 29, 2019 6:28PM	stickguy	I like full service. I hate when they short staff the pumps.
2757	August 29, 2019 6:30PM	xwesx	"In Oregon, short-staffing the pumps is SOP. In fact, they try to sell the law as if it is a safety thing, yet the attendants never stick around to monitor the pumping and be on-hand should something go wrong. It is just a mis-guided thing that needs to go. If people want attendants, then the demand will drive the supply.

And, staffing the pumps is not the same thing as full service. I also enjoy that, mostly for the banter during the process (I'll fill the fuel, the attendant will do things like clean windows, check tire pressure if I ask for it, etc). There's a Chevron in Pendleton, OR, that has GREAT service. I always enjoy stopping in there when we are in town."
2758	August 29, 2019 6:35PM	stickguy	To me full service = someone else gets their hands smelly. I don’t want those people touching anything else on my car, including the windows. No way in heck I let them mess with the tires or go under the hood!
2759	August 29, 2019 6:40PM	stickguy	Was reading up on the passport. Looks nice but I think just too big. Especially wide. That sucker might have serious trouble fitting in the garage. We will still check it out, but my guess is wife won’t like it. But she might surprise me!
2760	August 29, 2019 6:48PM	au1994	Ahhh thanks. Apple house here too so it didn’t register.
2761	August 29, 2019 7:15PM	corvette	When I was in OR and fueled up, the stations were overrun with attendants in yellow safety vests. Sounds like staffing has gotten worse.
2762	August 29, 2019 8:16PM	benjaminh	My guess is that it would be wise to just get her what she wants.

Next service visit I’m going to chat up service dude about what issues they are actually seeing on them. Hopefully the 2020, the earliest we would get, are more trouble free. And one reason I’m reluctant to get a slightly used one."

Even now, more than two years after the loss of her ""beloved"" 2010, she still laments that car. She says about the ""new"" one, ""This is the family car. The last one was MY car. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate having it, but it's not *MY* car."" LOL This, after she insisted that I find her the same thing she lost, and I, as well as a certain friend we all know, went to great lengths (literally) to find her what she wanted. /sigh"
2768	August 29, 2019 10:08PM	stickguy	my wife has commented about getting confused by something in my car, and how she knows how everything works (well, at least the stuff she uses) in the RDX. So going to something completely different is going to be a shock to her system. Probably safer with something simpler, like the Subaru. A fancy BMW or Mercedes might be too complicated. Heck, I doubt she could get a new BMW into gear. Never mind using the radio or navigation!
2769	August 29, 2019 10:16PM	benjaminh	Savage Geese likes most things about the new RDX, except he doesn't quite like Acura's true touch pad. But as he says it can get over the air updates. Usability is addressed starting at 8 minutes.
2770	August 29, 2019 10:35PM	Sandman6472	Dorian is on the way here, or somewhere in Florida. Folks are going nuts already as the gas lines are long as well as the supermarkets. The Costco at my Hertz HLE was on the news as there was so many vehicles in line, the tanker couldn't get to the filling area! Have to work tomorrow but filled up last night on my way home and was home today. A3 is going to get online after dinner as it's only half full. Have a good feeling that the storm will turn northwards and we'll be just fine, just a rain event. But, we're ready as we can be. The kids in Orlando want to come home, so we'll see what they decide.

2773	August 29, 2019 10:45PM	xwesx	"Despite the crazy overgrown jowl look on the front bumper shell, I still must say that VAG does a fine job of making elegant vehicles.

I also saw a Ford Fusion (~2012 vintage) up close the other day, and it reminded me of just how transformative that design was at the time, and how influential it was on this decade of cars. As much flak as Ford often gets on its cars, it has had an astounding influence on the automotive industry for a long, long time."
2774	August 29, 2019 10:46PM	Sandman6472	"Wife mentioned a new vehicle for herself earlier. Was shocked as she's not quite at 50K yet. We got to talking about her next oil change and then what the Audi store wants to sell her for pre-paid maintenance. A lot of stuff for the $799 price, but then, she mentioned a new replacement. Also said she wants to do it when I do mine, she knows I have my sights set on a 2020 something. Turns out Hyundai has pushed back the intro of the new Venue model till next year sometime. And not sure what Honda will do about the new HR-V. Still need to drive the 2019 EX-L model to see how it really does drive. Only having a volume button on the audio system is a bummer really but I can get SAT radio, a must have. Also like the Corolla Hatch but doubt if Sirius/XM is an option.
Was on the phone with Apple tech the other night and they got my iTunes account all synced so now all the 880 plus songs are on my iPhone like I wanted. Took about 20 minutes with the tech until she figured out what I was doing wrong. Turns out I was one step away from getting it done all this time! But it's all synced now and I'm a happy camper.
Still not ready to start the search for new but I do know I'm going back to Japan or Korea next time out. Have done the German thing and though nice enough, I really want ""cheap to keep"" going forward and has to be able to run on regular petrol. Synthetic oil isn't required nor is a turbo if need be."

2776	August 29, 2019 11:42PM	sda	That was me. My SIL bought a new RDX Advance. Beautiful vehicle, she loves how it drives. But she has continued issues with the infotainment system, from slowness, to dropping connections, going black and not working at all despite repeated efforts to reboot. She is a tech person so this really rubs her raw. The dealers just throw up their hands, acknowledge the issues but have no resolution. She has complained to Acura customer service and has submitted a written complaint.
2777	August 29, 2019 11:43PM	tjc78	I for one at least find the Diesel Chevette intriguing!

And the listing cost $200, so really not much to me at all, but I guess something is something. I figure with the $800 over 15 mos, it still keeps the total payment under $400 for the new leasor.

We would like to use the new features. Nav, car play. Certainly heated seats and stuff like that. So all that needs to be easy to find and use."
2791	August 30, 2019 12:58PM	stickguy	I do like the Volvo’s. But going to be hard to get what we want within budget. That’s a reason I really want to compare to the new OB. That’s affordable, turbo is fast, and it’s got style.

I've also weighed ordering a 2020 GLS 580. However, initial pricing and inventory on them is going to be super unfavorable. If the 2020 GLE's rollout is any guide, the 2020 GLS rollout will be filled with pitfalls.

I'm trying to figure out how much the 2015 GL 63 will depreciate since it is part of the outgoing chassis. I also want to know how reliable they are. I've read conflicting accounts. The 4yr extended warranty is $7580 from my credit union, and a shorter factory warranty from Mercedes is $6995.

Volvo's new interface isn't all that easy either.

The only ""hard"" buttons are the front/rear defog and a volume knob. Everything else is done via the screen.

I don't mind it, but it takes some getting used to. They do try and make certain things easy to access, but there are a lot of left/right swipes and various menus to get things done.

For example, to turn on the heated seat you first tap the icon, then select whether you want the seat or the steering wheel.

Climate? Touch the temp setting on the screen, then another popup comes up with a slider for the temp."
2797	August 30, 2019 3:04PM	corvette	@mb_enthusiast that stinks about your windshield. At least the damage seems confined to the glass and it won’t need paint work, so should be an easy fix.
2798	August 30, 2019 3:26PM	stickguy	"the TLX is a mix of buttons (climate) and touch. the temp is a rocker switch, but heated seats you touch that spot and it pops up the screen for heat or ventilate. But, pretty simple really. Nothing I can recall that is really menus, and the touch screen has obvious ""buttons"" to hit to pop up your options (like fan speed)."
2799	August 30, 2019 4:07PM	suydam	I like the interface on the Volt. Climate is a knob to adjust the fan speed and a knob to set temp. These are just below the touchscreen in easy reach. I use the touchscreen for infotainment, Nav, and charging. There are other menus but those are the ones I tend to use. The heated seats are controlled by easy to see buttons next to the gear shifter, one on each side. This isn’t my interior car color but you get the idea.
2800	August 30, 2019 4:15PM	stickguy	That’s similar to the Hyundais and genesis I drove. Works well, and easy to use

Like many windsheilds today, the one on the Subaru has to be ""calibrated"" due to the Eyesight system. No mobile swap outs for us, nosireee.

I can’t understand contemporary dealership behavior either. I’ve been experiencing a similar thing. The large dealership groups have been keeping better track of customers and collecting and sharing their data.

I noticed that I’d been flagged as a “bad lead” by the dealership I eventually leased my Q8 through. The first deal with them blew up when things that we’d agreed upon weren’t reflected in the lease agreement. It blew up even further when the “sales manager” ripped the papers out of my hands when I said I’d like the night to read over them. I’ve also had salespeople seemingly become frustrated with me, asking me if I’m serious because I’d been cross-shopping multiple makes and models. “You’ve sent leads into BMW, Land Rover, and Mercedes. What are you looking to accomplish?” Oh, I dunno...get a good deal on a car that I like... So, these days they are more focused on low information and emotionally attached buyers.

I just met with the salesman selling a GL 63. I told him what time I’d be coming in. But...he was dealing with another customer, and I hate to deal in stereotypes, but I’m sure that she was easier pickings—so she got more attention.

Well, the salesman wasn’t interested in negotiating. I asked him how motivated they were. He started lecturing me about how the price had been reduced multiple times...yes, but it’s also been on this lot since at least April. It’s also both pre-facelift and the outgoing chassis. “It’s priced in.” I don’t think so. It’s higher than the other GL 63s in the area, and it’s lacking a few of the options that AMG buyers typically order. Guy was kind of rude when talking about a pre-purchase inspection demanding that I have my mechanic “ready to go, so I don’t have to be sitting there all day instead of selling cars” Ummm...I’m sure you can drop the car off there or let me take the car there like every other fricking dealer in the area.

I’m not begging for any car, and I’m not paying above NADA trade-in, let alone retail, for something like this. Did I mention that this dealer can’t sell a VSC for it? I have to go to my credit union and finance through them. He didn’t ask me for an offer. Again, not going to beg for any car."
2816	August 30, 2019 10:47PM	carnaught	I think many or most of us car aficionados could tell stories of how, in the course of rough negotiations and taking car delivery, we ticked-off our salesman and/or sales manager and we became “marked” or singled out as a trouble maker. No?
2817	August 30, 2019 11:38PM	corvette	"@mb_enthusiast, how did you know you'd been flagged by the dealer as a ""bad lead,"" and how did you end up leasing from them in spite of that?"
2818	August 30, 2019 11:49PM	fintail	"I suspect I'm not on the good list at MB of Tacoma, who eventually ghosted me. I could see it coming from the time I mentioned ""money factor""."

I did mention that all cars now have some version of touch and controller, instead of old fashioned buttons.

she actually thought the Volvo model sounded best, since she knows how to use an iPhone, so mimicking that would not bother her!"
2820	August 31, 2019 12:12AM	benjaminh	"Could she live with a sedan? Does she have to have an SUV? A Volvo S60 sedan with a careful selection of options might be closer to your price range. But maybe trying the RDX system would be useful in case she likes it? And, as you say, Subaru is like a more affordable version of a Volvo. Even ten years ago Subaru interiors were less than ideal, but the 2020 Outback in the upper trims looks very good to me. I think even the top-of-the-line Outback with the turbo engine is less than the base model Volvo wagon.

But I'm now spoiled by the handling and 4-wheel steering of my TLX. I don't think a Subaru is going to have handling that's as good."

2822	August 31, 2019 12:55AM	stickguy	"She does not want a sedan. She likes sitting up a bit. If she did, could just take the TLX to work. I am paying for the miles!

I actually think, factoring in everything, the new OB is actually the perfect option for us and she would really enjoy driving it. Just need to try one out, and convince her of it. And yes, a Limited XT turbo (a loaded car) will MSRP for a fair bit less than the base price of a Volvo, before you add the option packages that are must haves.

I told her that when we are serious, will have to spend some time playing with the controls, even pairing her phone, using carplay, all that stuff."
2823	August 31, 2019 12:59AM	stickguy	"yeah, that would be the concept. Use the equity on a purchase and not have a big payment.

that one is not bad, but still expensive for a 2 YO unit, and it is the old body style. The cross country version I found on Carvana was also a 2018, but only $25,100."
2824	August 31, 2019 1:11AM	benjaminh	"Or The 2020 Outback seems like a good choice. Compared to a base Volvo wagon it has more rear legroom, more cargo space, and more power. Plus it can use regular fuel instead of premium. Insurance is probably lower too.

My local Subaru dealers doesn't actually have any 2020 Outbacks in stock. Several are in transit apparently, and so they should be arriving soon. Getting the very first of the line of an all-new model might be a little bit of a risk."
2825	August 31, 2019 1:17AM	mb_enthusiast	"That ultimately depends on the type of enthusiast one is and where one is shopping. I've always been treated with incredible respect and seriousness at all of my local Mercedes-Benz dealerships, and in Chicagoland, there are many. However, I imagine if one is used to dealing in pre-owned cars and used car dealerships, one is more likely to have these sorts of encounters. There is a distinctly different culture between dealership groups and brands too. The McGrath dealerships (Audi, Volvo, Honda, and Acura) are full of very aggressive personalities that engage in blatant hard-sell tactics. They are clearly coached and scripted. It's creepy. By contrast, the Autohaus (Rosengarden family) dealerships (Mercedes-Benz and Toyota) are total pussycats. They obviously tell their salespeople and service people to be very gentle and patient. However, what Autohaus doesn't do is negotiate. They have a take-it-or-leave-it approach to everything.

@mb_enthusiast, how did you know you'd been flagged by the dealer as a ""bad lead,"" and how did you end up leasing from them in spite of that?
I know I'd been flagged, because as we were finalizing the deal, the salesman left the desk for a minute, I went and looked at his computer screen and saw a list of leads. I noticed that I had been flagged as a ""BAD LEAD"" in red capital letters. I also looked at the computer of another salesman at a Volvo dealership and read all of the notes about other clients: ""Ready in March"" etc. I ended up leasing from the Audi dealership because they brought in a different ""sales manager"" to work with me after I complained and left the dealership. Went back in later in the week and shaved off over $6k off of the Monday 'agreement' and achieved all of my objectives regarding the money factor, incentives, Audi Care, trade-in, etc."

Mom & Dad went back to the dealer that they bought and have serviced their 2016 Cayenne since they bought it 3 years ago. My Mom does a lot of driving and her Porsche SUV currently has about 76,000 miles. Their salesman they worked with last time and thought was great now sells Ferraris in Florida. They called & made an appointment to test drive the Macan. The Salesman did answer all their questions, but had another couple there as well. He kept looking at his watch. My parents expressed interest in a 25,000 mile per year/ 2 year lease. The salesman kept saying: well, she should take a 15K per year lease and “watch her miles” and that they should take a 3 year lease because Porsche usually has a 12 month pull ahead program. They weren’t happy with how they were treated and later that night went on the dealership’s website. They clicked where it said to give them feedback. They ripped the salesman and it got posted to cars.com."
2836	August 31, 2019 2:02AM	mb_enthusiast	Never listen to that pull forward b.s. You end up paying one way or another.
2837	August 31, 2019 2:06AM	corvette	@nyccarguy I don't know Porsche's numbers, but I suspect he suggested a 3 year lease because the 2 year numbers are terrible, and same for adding additional miles. A 2 year, 25k per year lease would probably be, I'm guessing, $1500/month.
2838	August 31, 2019 2:09AM	nyccarguy	"The guy read the review and wasn’t too happy to say the least. I tried to smooth it over via email and I think we’ve moved past it. Bottom line, we found a Macan they like on their lot that has a build date of 1/2019. So it’s been on their lot for at least 5 months!

I email him the specifics of how I want the lease. Explained that we were good customers who have bought a vehicle there and literally have spent thousands of dollars in their service department during the last 12 months. I admittedly put in a lowball offer, but you don’t know until you try. His response was, “I own the car for $X and am not willing to sell for less.” I feel like if I had a trade that I owed more money on than it was worth he would offer me what the car was worth and wouldn’t care how much I owed on it. So now I’ve got his offer, time to email some other dealers."
2839	August 31, 2019 2:12AM	corvette	At least there are plenty of other dealers within a few hours' drive!
2840	August 31, 2019 2:21AM	stickguy	I was in the Porsche dealer down here last week. The (depressingly young) salesguy was very friendly. and they have plenty of cars it seems!

2842	August 31, 2019 2:25AM	stickguy	I love owner testimonials! I should have taken the wife back for a longer look at the 3.6 OB, but it was really late in the process at the time, and we had kinda settled on the Acura by then. I kinda drove it more out of curiosity, and from a good Honcker number, but really did like it a lot. did not even notice the CVT with the big engine. and none of the reviews I watched mentioned it as an issue.
2843	August 31, 2019 2:26AM	qbrozen	I have an appt Monday morn on a vehicle I feel confident will work out. It isn’t exactly what I want, but its cheaper and in better condition than others I have seen. And at least the seller has been responsive.
2844	August 31, 2019 2:38AM	nyccarguy	"Dealer #1 is all in at 10% off sticker, base lease rates & money factor through Porsche Financial.

So I started reaching out to a few other dealers in the area. One on the recommendation of a very good customer of mine who is a Porsche enthusiast who has dealt with the sales manager at a Porsche dealer in NJ (dealer #2). The sales manager from that dealer had one of his salesmen contact me via email. He gives me numbers and everything I ask for. He keeps quoting figures from US Bank which has a lower money factor and residual along with a number that is 8% off sticker. He asks how I want to proceed. I tell him the truth that his selling price is too high.

I start looking at inventory at other dealers. I find one in CT (dealer #3) that suits their tastes and send in an email request. The guy gets back to me with every number I ask for. He’s super responsive and very professional. In the end, his selling price is much higher than dealer #2 and then there is a $695 conveyance (doc) fee tacked on to it.

I also emailed a 4th dealer in NJ. I asked about a few vehicles. They were sold and never taken off the website.

So I email dealer #1 late in the afternoon to tell him we’d like to buy the car from him. I laid out the lease parameters using the selling price he gave me. I’ll see if he gets back to me tomorrow. If not. Next week."
2845	August 31, 2019 2:47AM	corvette	Would it be worth paying a broker from Leasehackr? Some of them will refuse payment and tell you to take the deal you’ve got if they know they can’t do better.
2846	August 31, 2019 2:53AM	nyccarguy	I went down that avenue too. The broker told me I did great with the 10% off deal.

But has apparently quickly gotten on board with my 1-for-2 swap since she is already sending me listings of vehicles she’d like to steal from me when I’m not looking. She did, however, nix my muscle car musings: “you already have the Dodge!” Yet a 2-seater sportscar is OK. Go figure. As much as I’d love one of those, I just can’t make sense of a vehicle I can take just one kid in.

2855	August 31, 2019 3:37PM	roadburner	"We only flagged actively dishonest people or anyone who made the sale more trouble than it was worth.
An example from the first category was a lady who was turning in a leased F30 that needed tires at all four corners. The hit from the tires was going to be $1,200. We offered to waive that charge if she leased another car. At the request of the NCM I went ahead and turned the car in to BMW FS without a tire replacement charge.Next day when the new car was ready for pickup she called and said she changed her mind- she wasn't interested in another lease. My NCM(who was new to BMW) asked if I could unwind the lease turn-in and charge her for the tires, but that ship had sailed. From that point on we never turned the lease vehicle in until the paperwork for the new lease or purchase was completed and the customer took delivery.
A prime example of the second group was a guy who wanted an X5M and wanted us to sell him a set of winter tires/wheels at $500 below our cost to go with it.
Another reason to ""fire"" a customer was when it was obvious that they were an unhappy and overly critical individual from the minute they walked in the showroom. Those types would inevitably ding us with a bad survey no matter how hard we tried to please them, so I would rather lose a sale than take the hit on the survey."
2856	August 31, 2019 3:52PM	ab348	"It's a tough call on flagging and probably there are bad actors on either side. I got a nasty message back from a sales guy once when he didn't do what he was supposed to do despite several requests from me (the owner's manual on a new car purchase had been ""lost"" somehow and he was supposed to get a replacement). When I got a survey I mentioned that and he didn't like it. Tough. OTOH I kept quiet another time when the Finance guy I had to deal with on a different lease was so inept that I was there in his office for nearly 3 hours. I figured he wouldn't be long for that place and I was right. On the last ATS purchase I was not happy with my salesguy and simply decided that whatever comes next for me in that department, he would not be part of it. He was very good at promising things but never delivered on most of them. The sales manager was much more helpful which saved the deal. It's been my experience that most salespeople do not like it when the customer knows the vehicle and what they are up to with sales tactics."
2857	August 31, 2019 4:36PM	qbrozen	No earlier hint. Just the 1-for-2 deal. She already approved 1, thinking it was in addition to the bimmer. I had yet to tell her the BMW would be leaving for a cash-buy fun car. There are so many possibilities on the table for this slot. Honestly, believe it or not, a Taurus SHO is looking pretty good. I mean, she nixed all Chrysler/Dodge products thus far. We are cautiously eyeing things like a Quattroporte, TTS, XKR, and CLS550. I’ll start sharing links when I get a chance.

Getting rid of the Alltrack and replacing with an older, but lower mile Audi A4 with just over half the miles (worth more) actually lowered my 5.5 months of insurance $25. Thought wagons got low rates? I suppose A4's are not crashed.

More surprising, the Tiguan being brand new saved us $11 for the 5 months left of insurance. It replaced the '16 Kia Optima lease, so maybe financing to purchase is cheaper on insurance?"
2881	September 1, 2019 2:40PM	andres3	Subaru's 3.6 is good enough to mask the shortcomings of CVT. Drive the 2.5 and you get another impression. The 3.6 Outback is a winner. Subaru Irvine wasn't dealing and wheeling though, so we ended up with an Alltrack.

It did. After the ignition switch scare put her into the first MINI, I took it a step a daily driver for another four years, and I used it for pizza delivery duty. Ended up giving it to my step son and his wife when I leased the Elantra GT? They drove it for another couple of years before gifting it to someone in need of a vehicle.

Yes, it was ugly and slow, but it was pretty reliable for the most part."
2885	September 1, 2019 5:27PM	qbrozen	It is rare that we travel as a family of 4. I often, however, have my 2 boys with me. So my thinking is that the 13-yr-old can sit in the front and slide forward, with the 9-yr-old behind him. The older one is 5’3” and the younger is 4’6”. Yes, they may grow, but let’s be real, I keep cars for maybe 2” of kid growth.

2892	September 2, 2019 6:32PM	sda	I drove my SIL’s ‘19 Acura RDX Advance. Very impressive and comfortable interior. Nice driving dynamics, quiet, quick. The heads up display is nice, didn’t feel much difference with the ventilated seats even set on high, great sounding audio. I couldn’t figure out how to change the XM stations other than a back/forward hard button next to the volume knob. Other basic controls were easy to use. I’m sure once I read the owners manual I would be in the know, but why should I do so just listen to the radio? I could easily welcome the RDX into our fleet.
2893	September 2, 2019 8:01PM	stickguy	how does it compare to the Q5?
2894	September 2, 2019 9:15PM	sda	"I don’t know how it compares to a second generation (current) Q5, the RDX feels larger inside as well as in size overall. Interior quality is on par with the Q5. They both lag a bit from a stop and then power comes on strong. Engine noise and smoothness are about the same, overall muted, smooth and decent exhaust note. Transmissions both race thru the gears to get to the next highest gear to enhance mpg, yet both are responsive. I did notice a little low speed bumpiness of gear shifts in the RDX, but not harsh. Steering effort is light in both with the Audi providing better feed back. Infotainment controls are a bit complicated on both with the Audi being a bit easier to figure out without consulting a manual. My SIL said she got 24 mpg on the highway and around 20 in town. I think that is disappointing, but it may do better as the engine fully breaks in. We are averaging about 24 mpg in the Audi, and my wife got closer to 28mpg on a recent trip.

Of interest, the RDX is FWD, and both have virtually identical tires: 235/55/19 101 H Continental Cross Contact LX Sport."
2895	September 2, 2019 10:19PM	qbrozen	"Supposedly, someone is going to start the transfer process with BMW tomorrow. We’ll see.

I guess I’ll spill what I have been up to since it doesn’t seem to be amounting to anything anyway. I have been shopping for a Hummer. Not a big surprise since I have considered them before.

It is getting much tougher to find clean, low mileage ones for reasonable money, though. I have attempted to buy a few over the phone, with no luck. Everyone is “standing firm” on their prices, which are $4k-$5k over auction.

I drove an hour on Friday to see one the dealer claimed was immaculate. I’ll admit it looked good on top. It was underneath that was a problem. That truck should not be allowed on the road. One good bump, and the rust holding the body to the frame is going to be less useful than masking tape.

Went for a 50-min trek this morning to see a private party vehicle. It had more miles than I want, at 119k, but it looked remarkably clean in the pics. And it was as promised in person. Very nice looking with nothing too bad to speak of save a minor oil seep at the rear of the engine. The problem, however, arose on the test drive. Long story short, the engine is making noises I am not comfortable with and would not even risk test driving any further than the 2 miles I put on it.

Anyway, if successful, this would be another extra vehicle the wife is permitting. If/when the BMW leaves, I’d be shopping for a sporty car for maybe $12k max, I think. So 2 vehicles, with very different purposes, for under $25k cash is the goal."

2898	September 2, 2019 10:26PM	ab348	A Hummer! I saw an original type Hummer (H1 I guess) on the road last week and did a double-take since I hadn't seem one in so long. Those ones are huge. It was a soft top model and had been all done over as a rolling billboard for a local car audio outfit. Looked quite impressive actually. I assume you are looking for one of the less massive models?

Once we get the new CUV for the wife, and the TLX goes back, I hope to get 2 cars to replace it. One might be the current RDX. or if that goes, some sort of fun car (with a stick) and something relatively inexpensive to sit in the driveway and do beater duty. Perfect case, a compact PU of some kind.

2903	September 3, 2019 12:01AM	nyccarguy	Hmm. Interesting choices @qbrozen . You have been drawn to those H3s in the past. Those are 5cyl? That XKR is very sexy. I’m far from one to give the thumbs up to a 10 year old Audi (I still can’t believe 2009 was 10 years ago), but that Black with Black/Red TTS is sharp looking.
2904	September 3, 2019 12:38AM	roadburner	XKR for me; one of the techs at BMW had worked on them and said that the later cars were pretty durable. Next up would be the Maser. Audis don't light my fire at all and the SHO is just a big boat.
2905	September 3, 2019 1:18AM	qbrozen	Well, not that they are anywhere near direct competitors, but the Maser and SHO are neck and neck in terms of size, weight, and acceleration.
2906	September 3, 2019 1:23AM	qbrozen	Yes, the ‘07+ H3 had a 3.7 5-cyl. Not quick but feels like enough when in a vehicle where speed is scary. Supposedly very reliable, as could be surmised by all the high-mileage ones out there. These vehicles do seem to have been overengineered.

2913	September 3, 2019 6:43AM	xwesx	"Probably not a surprise either, but I'm going to buck the preferences trend on @qbrozen 's listings and say that my favorite of the group is the SHO, followed by the TTs.

I love SHO's cinnamon brown exterior color; I still want a Flex, and that's my preferred color on it. Interior is dark, but I've been in these before and they are quite roomy and comfortable. Sadly, never driven a SHO; the standard V6 scooted the car well enough, though, so I suspect the SHO could be a fun experience without breaking the bank and while taking everyone (and everything) along for the ride! The trunks on these things are just huge. We had a rental once that swallowed six peoples' luggage and still had room for more."
2914	September 3, 2019 11:13AM	ab348	Trouble is, the use of interior space is so inefficient on the Taurus/SHO that you would have had to leave 2 of those 6 people at the curb. Or perhaps make them ride in the trunk.

Next door, a tall light fixture fell onto the road and blocked a good 3/4 of it, owned by the H&R Block folks but besides small debris, we made out just fine. Never lost power and n/s today, so stayed home. Will report tomorrow as everything open tomorrow.
Feel terrible for the Bahamas as this thing just sat there for hours. It's picked up speed now and winds have died down. Now folks in South Carolina and North Carolina need to get their act in gear cause Dorian is coming your way. G-d speed folks and do take heed of any warnings just in case!!"
2920	September 3, 2019 6:51PM	Sandman6472	"I guess being a bit older than you guys, just the thought of any debt makes me shiver. I even hate having any balance on our credit cards and pay off one of them within days of any charge. But think that comes with always living under our means during married life and coming from a pretty comfortable family growing up. Sure, once I started work and left my parents roof, I lived in a much lower bracket and it's been that way ever since. We've brought the kids up the same way and all three are excellent with credit and right now, only the oldest has a mortgage as she paid off her new Cruze within six months.
As much as I'd like a fun vehicle also with the Golf, never seeing it happen though it would be cool. Guess I'd rather see the $ in the bank or in retirement investments as I plan on retiring sometime within the next 12 months, if not sooner. And leaving South Florida is number one on my list of changes if I have my way!! So, right now any new vehicle is just so low on the priority list or it is unless something major happens with the Golf."
2921	September 3, 2019 8:19PM	qbrozen	I’m getting the feeling maybe I should not buy an H3. I know my previous research told me it is very reliable, yet I have now personally inspected 2 with issues, been told by salespeople on 2 other candidates that they are dumping the trucks at auction because they have too much wrong with them, and 1 other that told me they had to put so much into repairs that they can’t reduce their price.
2922	September 3, 2019 8:20PM	stickguy	Plus it must drive like a beast.
2923	September 3, 2019 8:23PM	28firefighter	I could see you coming to that conclusion based on all of those factors. Pretty sure I had a similar experience with the Viggen and still bought it. So far, no one was wrong!

I am so spoiled by the adaptive chassis package on the Q8. Driving the GL around today felt like a chore—really makes me want to buy something else.

In other news with the Q8, the windshield has to come from Deutschland, and it will take at least ten days to get here. The body shop is letting me pick the car up in the meantime.

Any recommendations for a well-handling luxury SUV that is not a 2020 GLS with E-Active Body Control...? Preferably has a pre-owned supply."

2949	September 4, 2019 2:17AM	corvette	My friends were looking for a daily driver with good towing capabilities and kind of had their hearts set on a used Sequoia. Budget was a concern, so I suggested a subsidized lease on a pickup, but they ended up with a used GLS550 and are really delighted with it--I think I would be too! They have other cars, are both mechanically adept, and connected in the auto industry, so I don't think potential repair costs weighed into the decision as much as it would for the average person.

When I got my '09 Genny I went to Akron Ohio to get it. That's about a 2 1/2 hour drive from the Burgh (didn't even try to hold my breath for that trip).

When Mrs. j got her '12 Legacy we went to Columbus Ohio. That's about a 5 hour drive (no breath holding for this trip either).

When I got my '15 Genny we went to Fairfax Virginia. That's about a 3 1/2 hour drive (again, no breath holding).

Lastly, when Mrs. j got her replacement '18 Legacy this past April, I cheated. Just drove down the road about 5 miles. Was barely blue from holding my breath when we got there.

But the lock the time off off the ground although he wants an SUV, also a big fan of the flex but no one would buy one of those except me. I’ve never been in one of those yet.

3007	September 5, 2019 12:02AM	andres3	"Got my 35K mile service done on the '16 TTS. Needed to get the faulty seat heater button in the left vent looked at. Apparently the lens that shows the 3 red lights for the seat heater function has become detached and defective. Part coming from Canada so I'll take the car back in probably next week. Won't need the seat heater anytime soon in CA.

Next, the tech noticed one of my rear suspension mounts is apparently making more noise than it should. Ordered me a new suspension mount. They'll do that at the same time.

the 35K service specifically doesn't include brake fluid change service, but they went ahead and did it anyway! So sad and disappointed, as I had fairly fresh Motul RBF 600 fluid recently put in. The Dot 4 OEM stuff can't handle truly high temps these fast cars are capable of producing! Apparently, they have a 2 year timer on this service and since I refused it last time it just keeps pinging the system.

The new service advisor said I was the first client of his that would have ""refused"" a free brake fluid change service.

Service manager said I could bring in a brake fluid of my choice when I wanted, and they'd put it in for me to make up for this.

Guess this goes back to the ""if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."" Or find a great shop that isn't a dealership! I knew I shouldn't have selected the ""free"" maintenance, as it's not very ""free"" anymore.

the other moral of the story is read your service advisor's paperwork! I never requested the brake fluid, but that's what the paperwork said."

3013	September 5, 2019 12:50AM	corvette	The extended service package was a great amount of savings on my parents' Q5. I know it's annoying about the brake fluid, but at least they have offered to make it right by replacing it with the correct fluid. I'd probably make a note to ask them which future services will include brake fluid flushes, and just plan on bringing my preferred fluid for them to use.

Healthcare is really a different animal compared to most jobs, in terms of immediately firing people when there is any question at all about something they did. Get rid of the employee and figure out what actually happened later! One of my friends works for a large health care system in another state and is familiar with the HIPAA controls on their patient management software. If you access someone's patient record you don't have a reason to be accessing, there is no warning or anything. The administrators get notified and you're terminated.

My gig, on the other hand... We have a decent organization, but they've kept some very disappointing employees on board, and there is an entire department (not mine) that is completely disorganized. I'm not sure that they've ever fired anyone in my department, but I know they have asked/encouraged some particularly bad ones to leave."
3016	September 5, 2019 1:14AM	nyccarguy	"I completely understand. My guys literally screw up on a daily basis in some way shape or form:

She was fired because the mistake “could” have lead to the patient getting seriously injured and then the hospital “would” have been liable for her actions."

An N12 or N14 won't tolerate that. The PO of my car was not mechanically adept at all, but she heard the noise and had enough sense to take it to the dealer and have the guides and chain replaced- for less than 10% of what the imbecile MCS owner had to shell out.

3030	September 5, 2019 1:03PM	corvette	"Wow, that’s a ton of money to sink into that MINI and then dump it. Someone on The Truth About Cars wrote something one time about the thing that makes someone dump a car is often not the extremely expensive repair, it’s the minor repair that almost immediately follows the expensive one.

I think the psychology is that the owner has the expensive repair, decides they’re going to keep the car and fix any and all outstanding issues. Then the car rewards them a few months later with another broken part. This breaks their dream of bringing the car to near-new condition and reliability, and they dump it."

3050	September 5, 2019 10:59PM	corvette	"Interesting on that MINI, it looks like the original owner waited until 1 year and 17k to have the first service done. I thought those called for the first service early at around 7,500-10k miles. Engine replaced at 25k, then waits until 41k to have the oil changed on the new engine (one year and 16k for those playing along at home). Inexplicably, MINI offered it as a CPO.

Fitting the narrative I talked about above, owner #3 had the engine replaced in June, then there was another service visit in August, which is probably the straw that broke the camel's back."
3051	September 5, 2019 11:02PM	andres3	One school of thought is that you don't want to fire someone that made a huge mistake because they may learn from the huge mistake, and never do it again, where as a new hire might make the same, or some other huge mistake.

3058	September 5, 2019 11:45PM	roadburner	"Speaking of Z Cars, looking at 370Zs to replace the 2er have been frustrating. The only new Z I like is the 50th Anniversary Edition; it has heated seats and a few other upgrades over the Sport model. There's one in Louisville, and it's an automatic. There's one new Sport with a manual at the same dealer; I'd like to test drive it, but it's in the showroom. I'd like to see what the manual feels like but I don't want to test drive a car I know I'm not going to buy. The base car is a true loss leader, weak brakes, no LSD, etc., so it's not even a consideration.
According to the Nissan USA website, the nearest 50th Anniversary cars with three pedals are between 500-900 miles away. If a CPO NISMO manual in anything other than black turned up I'd definitely give it a hard look.
Anyway, for now I'm just not seriously looking after the Z search was a bit of a non-starter."

3063	September 6, 2019 2:01AM	marcogallo1986	@qb and everybody else, well using Cars.com like I always do almost daily, came across this dealer called SZ Motor cars in Woodbury New York they have a good selection started looking through some of it 100 cars in stock in total. Found one 2006 hummer H2, or three I forget with 40,000 miles on it. They also have a 370 Z base, 2017 manual for a little over $20,000, miles were low. Check out the inventory everyone I just thought I let you all know. Since were all chronic car lookers and buyers Ha ha ha. Maybe I should just start going to the auction like my cousin does and get cars the New York City retired with low miles and he turns around and sells them for a little profit. He’s been lucky but I don’t know. They are mainly Chevy Impala‘s prior generation, and crown VICS are his favorite which he does drive one, he’s had since 2017 that he won’t get rid of, I think it has a little over 60,000 miles on it now, I think he got it with 50,000. He sent me the listing for one with 7000 something miles, I just got listed today might be on. Think he’s going to bid on it I think he put it on twin powers them and go with him Monday and pick up. The action cited to use is called property room. I went back in the beginning of July when you got a Ford explore for his parents they put a little money into but they drive it everywhere it’s a 2009 with a V6 the sock V6. And that is, he won two and powers one was 30 something thousand miles on it, and one with 50 something thousand miles on it but we got to go pick up Monday. Well I’m gonna go with him something to do.

3077	September 7, 2019 1:16AM	stickguy	"so, after dinner at the brew pup (wife was nice and mellow after a mug of pumpkin spice beer), daughter and I decided we should swing by the car dealer and wife played along. Honda dealer is open to 9 on Friday's so it was easy. They have a large showroom, so usually have most everything you want to see inside.

as a side story (always seems to be one of those when the princess is involved) her HS BF apparently is a salesman there, and of course was working tonight. Her current BF texted that she should flirt with him for a better price. I saw no problem with this!

anyway, saw a Passport outside. Kid liked the style with the black wheels (kept saying it looked like a Jeep. Not bad looking, but big. wife took one look and said it was too big. Sat in it, and still felt it was huge. And it is very wide (she was worried that it would not fit into the garage. that, and said it felt like a minivan inside. which was not a positive!

so, I now know that something that big (not just length, but height, width, bulk of the hood) is too much for her now. We did look at (locked so not sat in) a CRV, and agreed it was a much more manageable size. also much better MPG and $8k cheaper. But wife still remembers not liking how it drove (I think that was a CVT issue).

might get a few more looks in tomorrow. short list is actually on the short side now! decided to add one car back to replace the Passport (not that I think the new addition is going to make the cut) to keep it at 7."

3082	September 7, 2019 1:36AM	jpp75	I lived in Wilmington for 2 years and no way I would have bought from most of the local dealers.
3083	September 7, 2019 2:34AM	28firefighter	"So. The story is WA has some insane I3 rebates this month - $7500 lease credit, $3000 bonus credit, and $3000 loyalty. With minimal effort there are some deals to be had while inventory is still decent.

So I went out and drove one figuring it might be a low hassle, VERY inexpensive way to give the electric car experience a try and get out of the X1 early, avoid dispo fee etc. I actually really liked it.

The model I drove was a 2016 REX with Tech and Tera packages. The instant torque is addicting - makes it feel fast. The 2019 is even faster with much better range. The regenerative braking is kind of fun and modulating the throttle and watching traffic ahead to do so isn’t all that different from stop and go traffic in a manual, trying to avoid constant clutching. Handling isn’t bad, but isn’t amazing. It isn’t a sports car but also doesn’t pretend to be.

The recycled interior and eco friendly bits would take some getting used to, but wasn’t bad by any means. The seats took a bit of adjusting to find the right spot.

The suicide doors would be annoying while S is rear facing. His seat fits amazingly well with lots of room in front, but he’d have to be loaded from the driver side. For the right price it’s fine.

Landed what I think is a reasonably strong $299 due and $299 a month for 24 months on a well equipped i3 REX with Tech, but the catch is they can’t help with the last few payments on the X1. That unfortunately makes it far less interesting to us because then there are other cars (with 4 real doors) my wife would want to shop. She isn’t wrong.

Model 3 is still interesting but leases like absolute garbage."

We found low cylinder pressure in the right bank, but our unscientific measurements of the head on the workbench indicate it is still within specs. Fingers crossed just a new gasket does the trick. Of course, doing tbelt and all that other stuff while its apart. My dad used to help him out with this stuff so now he is looking for my guidance.

Perhaps I'm prejudiced by the late Lexus RX300; I test drove a turbo 4 '18 Porsche Macan, Blue over Tan, earlier this week. Out of state dealer, so unfamiliar with the test roads, but sales dude did offer a nice variety of main/ back and highway. (Mega mall dealership, MB/Porsche/Audi/Mini/Lexus. Disneyworld)

Nice interior, 18 way adjustable seat, so no problem there. Big gauges, had to remember speedo to the left of center, but a digital readout in the tach straight ahead. Lots of buttons, which I like vs. touch screen (which is also there) or iDrive/Comand do-hickeys. Better visibility than the XE. Ok interior storage, hatch utility. Handsome, too.

I drove it in both sport and comfort mode, noticeable difference. Not much sound from the engine, ride and handling seemed well balanced. Turbo lag, perhaps my driving style. But, I just wasn't moved. Nothing against the Macan, no doubt likely the best driving SUV, but I just don't like being Mr. Bus Driver. Not as Mr. Bus Driverly (duh, big understatement here) as the RX300, but while there certainly is an advantage to sitting up high, I just kept thinking, this is nice, but it's not a low to the ground sports sedan.

Still a contender, still haven't decided if I'm ready to replace the XF. If I do go ahead, I'll have to drive the XE and Macan again, back to back if possible.

Of course, today I did go sit in a '19 Mazda Miata RF... I was albe to get in and out, not gracefully, but doable. How many more years will I be able to do that!?

today's project was installing a new ceiling fan in the sunroom. The prior owners had demo'ed everything for some reason out there (pull out paneling, leaving bare OSB, took down the light, leaving the wires hanging out of the box, and pulled up the stick down vinyl planks. between that and being filthy, it was not a happy place.

now, all the windows have been cleaned, door painted, concrete floor painted, OSB painted (you can actually do that. still looks like OSB, but now white!) New rug down. And as of an hour ago, a spanking new ceiling fan with light up on the ceiling. Didn't fall down, isn't wobbling, and no sparks, flames or smoke poured out of the ceiling, so I consider it a success.

I was hoping the switch in the kitchen that seemed to control nothing was for that ceiling fixture. Turns out there was a wall fixture on the side wall it worked. Just another burned out bulb. replaced that, and now it works.

the new gizmo was a continuity tester. for some reason, I don't seem to have collected one over the years. what a wonderful gadget. Figured out the box need the door to the outside (sutffed full of wires) is probably intended to be the switch that controls the fan. So need to get a switch to installed, and based on the more wires than expected to find, it might be a 2 way (which usually means there is another switch someplace so who the hell knows). That is for another day. at least the fan and light work on the pull chains. if I get the switch done and that works the fan, more the better.

just about done now. last project (which my daughter might end up doing) is putting on new doorknob and deadbolt on the door into the house after she finishes painting it. and tonight I need to install the last blackout shade in the bedroom, and I should be pretty much done. until she finds something else to put on the list."

That sucker was heavy. and of course, the opening was 1/2 inch narrower than the standard size blind (70"") so 2 options. Pay 2x as much for a custom, or cut it to size yourself. With the tight budget the kids are on, they picked the cheaper option, and I dug the chop saw out and cut an inch off with that. Actually worked great, then pretty easy to install, just required 4 brackets because of the weight.

I spent way too much time working with my hands above my head today. Definitely too old for that."
3117	September 8, 2019 4:06AM	stickguy	"forgot the car updates. Stopped at Subaru. Saw a sales go in the parking lot. he said they had a few new OBs, but they were on a corporate stop sale (no clue why, maybe to clear out the 2019s, or let stock on the ground build up), and said they were in the back corner. so we went looking\. Might have been across the street in the extra lot. did see a base level Legacy. Looked just like the old one, but definitely different interior. Have to go back next weekend to actually check one out.''

then went next door to Volvo. sat in everything inside. Loved the seats in the S60! For the cuvs, they had a V60 CC. Nice, I liked it. She thought :it was a wagon. And that it sat too low (she thought she fell down into the seat. So that is out. Really liked an XC40 they had, but after some discussion, decided it was a bit too small, plus from reading it might not be luxurious/cushy enough for her. She did like the XC60 though, and we were parked next to one outside so saw it really was not longer. Not sure about wider. But one nice feature, power folding mirrors!

no drives today. Still need to swing by Hyundai, BMW and VW dealers to test sit. With possibly a side stop at the Audi dealer. I do want her to check out the tiguan. Even though she does not like VW, but she finally said what it was she did not like. The seats in the Jettas, were too tight for her. most likely, that won't be an issue in the Tiguan."

And of course, the garage is my realm too, and I at least cleared enough room to get the 3 cars in. Started hanging some shelves and organizing today, but still have some work to do.

We measured and found that the view outward plummets by as much as 50 percent, making it the worst in the compact-hatchback segment.

By DAVE VANDERWERP
AUG 30, 2019

C/D test data quantifies what's easily seen by the naked eye: a substantial drop in rear visibility in the latest Mazda 3 hatchback.

The nearest point on the road that the driver can see is 97 feet behind the 3's rear bumper, more than six and a half times the length of the car itself.

That's nearly 50 percent worse than the previous-generation 3 and the worst in the compact-hatchback segment....""

More at the link

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28857236/2019-mazda-3-hatchback-visibility-rear-window/

And the Mazda 3 has a torsion-beam rear suspension that has degraded handling according to C & D and some other publications. I used to be a fan of Mazdas, but not as much anymore. I think the sedan looks ok, but the hatchback just looks strange to me."
3135	September 9, 2019 11:51AM	au1994	I think you would like that. Tons of fun and a great second, fun car. The Jeep owners are great and of course the aftermarket is huge when the inevitable modification bug hits.
3136	September 9, 2019 11:51AM	au1994	"All very pretty. I could make do with any of them!

Glad the move is done. I’ve done a couple from major relo’s to a new state to just across town and they can be equally stressful."
3137	September 9, 2019 11:53AM	au1994	Funny, there was an ad on TV for these over the weekend and from the rear quarter view I said to myself it must be nearly impossible to see out.
3138	September 9, 2019 12:07PM	qbrozen	"I always said I’d have another Jeep someday. Of course, I was thinking CJ7, but I suppose this would qualify. But now I’ve been thinking... “wait a sec. why am I OK with cloth and no amenities in a Wrangler, yet have been turning my nose up at any H3 with cloth?”

Yes, mods would be in store for any of these “trucks” I have been looking at. Was even reading up on what I could do with the XC60 (hint: not much)."
3139	September 9, 2019 12:28PM	kyfdx	Anyone notice that Honcker changed their name to Rodo?
3140	September 9, 2019 12:32PM	tjc78	Yes I did... I was like what is this new app on my iPad? I googled it, then proceeded to delete it!
3141	September 9, 2019 1:40PM	pensfan83	That was me lusting after the 80's Monte Carlo SS. The Prelude must have heard that I was looking to sever the relationship because the check engine light came on last night.
3142	September 9, 2019 1:46PM	qbrozen	"yes, noticed that name change. well, I didn't notice as much as they sent me an email to tell me they changed their name. My login still doesn't seem to work, so I can't check up on the new app to see if it is any different. Probably not.

I have a doc appt today and there happens to be 2 dealerships ""on the way"" that have several vehicles I'd like to test drive. Between them, I should be able to check out the Wrangler Unlimited, XC60, JGC hemi, and another Hummer. Oh, and a 2013 C300 4matic Sport with 58k miles for $14k. Seems like a good value. Although I'm sure it won't satisfy my sportscar slot, but worth a look."
3143	September 9, 2019 1:53PM	nyccarguy	The last time mine thew a CEL, the Idle Air Control Valve was the culprit. Mine was original and VERY dirty. Pretty inexpensive fix IIRC. The part is a generic Honda part and NOT Prelude specific. My mechanic was able to get one from his sources same day.

3147	September 9, 2019 2:26PM	stickguy	"Yeah honker changed the name. App is different too. But they did add a slider to adjust DAS and payment to anything you want, with 1st payment the minimum. I still browse just to see what must be highly incentivized at the moment.

They took away “deals of the day” but I think that might be coming back."
3148	September 9, 2019 3:49PM	tjc78	"Depends.. some can be had for under 5 figures, others (like a mint 87 GNX) could be six figures.

I'd look for a clean Regal T-Type over a Monte, but that's just me."
3149	September 9, 2019 4:11PM	pensfan83	"I would love one but I've generally shied away from considering a GN because of the premiums they command. I've seen them range anywhere from mid 30's to almost six figures. Clean, low mile GNX's can go over six figures.

Personally I don't see a real benefit to paying for a low mileage example unless you plan to keep it that way in the hopes of retaining or increasing its value. If I'm planning on driving it more than a few hundred miles a year I'm fine with one that has higher mileage as long as required maintenance and repairs are documented. I found that out when searching for the Prelude. I could pay a premium for low miles and face an internal debate whether I preserve it in the hopes of turning a profit come sale time or I buy one for half the price that has higher miles, same condition, and have zero concern about turning a profit. I chose the latter and almost one year in am glad I did."

3151	September 9, 2019 7:04PM	xwesx	When you get as old as the H3, it is probably best to look at the best car for the mechanical equipment you want, and you can worry about appointments like leather aftermarket. It is not overly expensive to reupholster in leather if you really want to go that route.
3152	September 9, 2019 7:08PM	xwesx	Goal reached!
3153	September 9, 2019 7:17PM	qbrozen	"Alright. Got out to 1 dealership today. Drove a Charger, E550, JGC hemi, and a Hummer they had. Really really liked the Charger. The sound is just phenomenal. I didn't even mind the old 5-speed unit. And this particular one has really nice leather/suede seats that seem to be a very rare find. Was thinking I'd want a newer one, and I would prefer the '11+ style, but this one is super clean and cheap, so it is tempting me. Someone talk me out of it: https://www.bakerjeep.com/used/Dodge/2008-Dodge-Charger-Princeton-99a9c91c0a0e0a6b408c7ad5d4a47f23.htm

That was first. Then drove the E550 right after it. I gotta say, I much preferred the Charger. The E had an overly harsh ride. It was downright nauseating. The JGC was nice enough, but I didn't like how it drove. Very bouncy. Again, nauseating. The Hummer had mechanical issues, so I drove it maybe a half mile before returning it to the dealership."
3154	September 9, 2019 7:19PM	stickguy	So the charger, is that the practical/utility car, or the sports car, of the two-fer?
3155	September 9, 2019 7:21PM	stickguy	Too big for my taste, but looks like a nice one. Loaded. If you like it, go for it!
3156	September 9, 2019 7:57PM	ab348	I dunno, Q., it looks like it is is great condition, but for a car that is almost 12 model years old with 100K miles that seems like a lot of money.
3157	September 9, 2019 8:01PM	breld	Sounds to me like the powers above are steering you away from a Hummer.

3160	September 9, 2019 8:14PM	28firefighter	Nice color combo on that 430. But having had the non-HK audio, you'd probably want that. The HK audio isn't great, but it is leaps and bounds above the standard which is really sub-par.
3161	September 9, 2019 8:21PM	stickguy	"This one is prettier colors. A few less miles, a little less money. But trades KK for BLIS. Not a trade I prefer to make. No clue why an executive car just didn’t have the driver assist package too. It’s standard even on a $20k Hyundai Elantra!

3163	September 9, 2019 8:40PM	stickguy	I don't think I would miss the M sport. Isn't that mostly trim items anyway?
3164	September 9, 2019 8:46PM	stickguy	I guess it includes a sportier suspension set up. Would have to drive both ways to see if it makes enough of a difference to care about. We would be more about comfort than tracking!
3165	September 9, 2019 8:46PM	qbrozen	"well, its worth what its worth. Their price is definitely ""cheeky."" My offer, if I make an offer, would be $9k OTD. I'm perusing still, though. Would like to find one in a better color, and possibly even with the 2011 facelift. OR a similar Challenger. At the same time, for $9k, I have plenty of room for mods."
3166	September 9, 2019 8:52PM	breld	"I do believe for an AWD model, the M-sport does indeed amount to cosmetics (body kit, wheels, steering wheel).

But I will say, that M-sport steering wheel feels great!"
3167	September 9, 2019 9:13PM	stickguy	not like the old E46 days, where you had to get the sport package for the 3 spoke wheel!
3168	September 9, 2019 9:14PM	xwesx	The only thing I can say is that the automatic would be a strong case for continuing to look. Otherwise, seems like a lot of car.
3169	September 9, 2019 9:22PM	pensfan83	I reached out to the SM at my parent's Ford dealer since their sales person is either out of the office or just not responding. Simple request, 24/12 lease on an F-150. Received a reply within 5 minutes that just said the dealer has an Internet department for this very purpose, please send the request through them, and asked why I would go to him for a price quote. OK then...

3171	September 9, 2019 9:56PM	roadburner	Yep. H-K, M Sport, CWP, amd RWD are baseline minimums for any F3X I'd consider.
3172	September 10, 2019 1:00AM	pensfan83	Same dealer who refused to offer any goodwill toward my mom's infotainment repair until my dad went above the service manager. Ever since the original owners were bought out by a larger dealer group about 12 years ago things have gone downhill. My parents have been unfailingly loyal to this store since the 80's but the past few years that loyalty has been tested and I think this might be what pushes them to a new store if not to a new brand altogether.
3173	September 10, 2019 1:54AM	corvette	Ford dealers are all over the place, they should be able to find one somewhere nearby that will treat them well. That being said, I live in a city with two Ford plants, and the only good service experiences I've had are with the dealer in the sketchy part of town. The one in the gentrified part of town totally blew it--and didn't care at all when I dinged them on the survey.

3178	September 10, 2019 2:26PM	corvette	I like the orange and the stripes, and I normally hate decals. Not having radio controls on the steering wheel would drive me nuts. I’m actually thinking of getting a Bluetooth remote that clips on the steering wheel of the Tahoe so I can skip ads on podcasts I’m playing via the aux cable. It has audio controls on the wheel, just no smartphone integration.

3194	September 10, 2019 3:40PM	nyccarguy	One of the benefits of my wife's job was that it was less than 3 miles from our house. She had her 1st interview today at a hospital about 30 miles north of us. Let's see how things shake out, but we put close to 18,000 miles per year on her Pilot when her job was close. We might have to do something with the current fleet.
3195	September 10, 2019 3:46PM	qbrozen	"So discussion with my little one yesterday went something like this (obviously, I am summarizing what was probably an hour of back and forth):

me: so what do you think? (showing him pic of white charger I drove)
him: That's a garbage car! It belongs in the garbage! Ew!
me: well we can make it look better.
him: no.
me: is this more to your liking? (showing him pic of black SRT8 with all the doodads)
him: now THAT'S the opposite of a garbage car! Get that one!
... after explaining to him that these cars are exactly the same and its just cosmetics, we get into color discussion...
me: I would choose purple first, then orange, then B5 blue, then red, THEN black.
him: Purple??! Why would anyone want a purple car?!
me: It is a classic famous color, called Plum Crazy. Its limited edition and rare and very very cool. Then there is the orange, also rare, and with the black graphics is very cool ... do you remember Snot Rod from Cars? Like that.
him: What's B5 Blue?
me: very similar to the Coronet.
him: Then you need that one. B5 Blue. Get it.

I then pondered the quirkiness of having a '67 Coronet R/T AND maybe an '07 Charger R/T, both in ""b5 blue."" Alas, they didn't offer it in '07, nor in '12 (45 yrs apart), but they did offer a couple of somewhat similar blues in 2012."

3199	September 10, 2019 5:18PM	kyfdx	You really want the 2007-2010 with the upgraded 255 HP engine (that feels like 300 HP), instead of the 225 HP from that year.
3200	September 10, 2019 5:45PM	qbrozen	You forget I've been shopping for a 5-cyl Hummer. Speed on this vehicle isn't my top concern. haha.
3201	September 10, 2019 6:11PM	corvette	Poking around the Ford dealer’s website, it appears an F-150 XL with the STX package is really well equipped and could potentially replace the Tahoe one day. Parking sensors are optional on that trim and they’re not commonly equipped that way, and no BLIS is offered. Besides that, HID/LED headlights are the only other thing I’d really like to have.
3202	September 10, 2019 6:44PM	Sandman6472	"Looks like more weather could be on the way. So tired of these hurricanes!! Driveway guy came and gave me two options for doing the driveway...one less pricey good for a couple of years and another more pricey but they add more asphalt and will last a longer time. He saw my garage floor and showed me an option for doing that, something I’d love to do actually. So now have to sit down and think what to do here. Gonna get flack no matter what so just need to decide how much I really want to spend.
Thinking is when we do sell, new owner will want to get a concrete driveway anyways so best to go the cheaper route if it could get me the few years I need to get out of this old shack!"
3203	September 10, 2019 7:07PM	Michaell	I thought you were planning to sell and move north soon - doesn't seem to make any sense to make that kind of investment, when it's pretty clear that you won't be able to recoup that cost in an increased asking price.
3204	September 10, 2019 7:08PM	xwesx	Nice combo there! Those colors actually work very well together.
3205	September 10, 2019 7:16PM	xwesx	Depends on the price of the work, but he very well could. A presentable driveway makes a great first impression.

3211	September 10, 2019 8:18PM	stickguy	"Sandy, without knowing how bad it is, I thought there were ways to patch and top coat (sort of a skim coat) to spruce up asphalt and seal it.

Unless it’s a true mess, I would do the cheap option to pretty it up and keep stabilized.

Spending money on a garage floor is probably a waste."
3212	September 10, 2019 8:24PM	tjc78	I had a guy spray my asphalt driveway years ago. Looked absolutely brand new for a few years. It's a little grey-ish again. I'll probably do it myself this time with the stuff from Lowes/HD
3213	September 10, 2019 9:55PM	corvette	The asphalt sealer I get seems to last 3 years, and they spread two coats. Next time, they’re going to have to fill some cracks that have widened.

3215	September 10, 2019 10:36PM	qbrozen	My driveway was ripped up today. We are having them lengthen and widen it while they are at it. 21 feet wide and I believe something like 130 feet long.
3216	September 10, 2019 11:59PM	xwesx	Really?! It sure doesn't present like something I would want to pay $65K to own. Pretty, though, for sure.
3217	September 11, 2019 12:00AM	xwesx	Wow! That's a hefty driveway! Are you painting a yellow line down the center while you're at it?
3218	September 11, 2019 12:01AM	nyccarguy	That project is on our list. Our driveway needed to be ripped up when we moved in. That was 9 years ago.

3223	September 11, 2019 5:28PM	xwesx	Do you get it out much? I find the family element to be the biggest challenge for me.
3224	September 11, 2019 5:32PM	xwesx	"I was able to put about 850 miles on it by the time school started for the kids (about four weeks ago). Since I am the one who takes my daughter to school, riding after that became more challenging. Thankfully, she was willing to try riding to school a couple days a week, and she has really taken to it, so I'm able to at least put a few rides into the week. On mornings when I take her, the first twelve miles (the ones with all the hills!) I do without any electric assist - I just have the processor on to log the miles and speeds. After I drop her off, I punch the assist and burn down the six miles or so to my office as quickly as possible.

After twelve miles without any assist, and carrying all of the gear (her backpack, etc., and my clothes for the day), using the assist feels so amazing."
3225	September 11, 2019 5:54PM	28firefighter	Not nearly as often as I'd like. I suspect it'll be easier once Sam is riding a bike.

3229	September 12, 2019 2:12AM	qbrozen	On hold till tomorrow. Guy was being a bit sketchy about the undercarriage so I was about to just give up and move to choice 2, but we spoke again tonight and he promises to get me a vid of it first thing. He is an hour behind me though.
3230	September 12, 2019 2:22AM	stickguy	Brave. so this is going to be another unit bought on faith, and you won't see it until it shows up in the driveway? Or going out to drive it home?
3231	September 12, 2019 2:27AM	Sandman6472	"They gave me a couple of options for the driveway, going with the cheaper one as I think it'll give me the results I'm looking for. At the very least, it will help with the curb appeal. The garage has been done by me three times already and looks really really bad. Having it look as good as my daughter's in her new house is something I've wanted for a long time. And the options I was shown with different colors looks really nice.
Our moving plans, or my plan, has been derailed a bit as the other half isn't ready to make any kind of move at this time. Think it's really because daughter #2 is living and working in South Miami. I think she's on board to try to transfer to a nonprofit hospital in the Orlando area and if I can really get that to happen, should make it much easier to get the wife out of South Florida. Even if I could get her to go somewhere on the I-4 corridor in Central Florida, that could work. Anything under 2 hours should work but any place we go, I'd prefer new construction again. Our condo was a new build as was the current casa, we just prefer new, just like with our vehicles. And as long as I can get around $400K for the current shack and can buy something new for under $300K, I'm in. Want to be able to bank at least $100K to add to our bank accounts plus have a nice 3/2 or 3/3. Just need one guest room should anyone want to sleep over.
Hopefully my plans will come to fruition I one day down the road. So any little things we can do now to help show off our current home will be $ well spent I'm hoping. My time frame is between now and 2022. Hopefully sooner but this is gonna take some time, gonna take some precious time!!"
3232	September 12, 2019 10:54AM	qbrozen	"Yup. Faith. I know, I know. But they are damned impossible to find here.

Alright, so a bit of a conundrum. Wife was giving me a hard time last night that is giving me 2nd thoughts. Here are my choices.

1. 2006 SRT8. 77k miles. Not my first color choice. Has been cosmetically modified in an unpleasant way so I would have to spruce it up a bit. Price is basically auction value for a clean stock example. About $13.5k all said and done. Looking forward 18 mos, I think I’d be out maybe $3500 for the experience.
2. 2008 R/T Daytona. 75k miles. My first color choice. All stock and unmolested. Price is fair retail. About $11.5k. I’d project maybe $3500 drop here as well.

Last night, I was leaning SRT just to have the quicker and more desirable vehicle. This morn, I’m leaning RT for comfort, color, immediate $2k savings, and no de-modding needed. It is a tough choice."
3233	September 12, 2019 11:11AM	pensfan83	My anecdotal experience is you never know whether the modifications were done professionally or slapped together and you've already expressed dissatisfaction. Personally I would go with the 100% stock example, it doesn't need to go under the knife after taking delivery and if you need more speed you could always take the $2K and add some go fast parts, right?
3234	September 12, 2019 11:45AM	nyccarguy	All logic points toward the R/T. I agree that unmolested with less power and the prospect of less headaches seems like the way to go here. $2k is a nice budget for some sticky tires and a set of sway bars.
3235	September 12, 2019 1:06PM	stickguy	I vote Daytona. It’s not a exactly slow.
3236	September 12, 2019 1:11PM	tjc78	"Not sure exactly what the SRT needs to cosmetically, but that’s my vote

Based on your posts I’m thinking you want something brash and far from the everyday. The R/T is nice but the SRT is a beast.

You do your own wrenching and aren’t going to keep it long anyway!

Just like you never say you wish you bought a smaller TV... you’ll never say I wish I bought the one with less power.

SRT or bust"

No cinder blocks, but we do have a set of rebreakable boards, 3 sets of focus mitts, and each one of us has leg guards, headgear, and 3-4 types of gloves. Oh and forget about anything short of a wagon when we are in weapons training.

3259	September 12, 2019 10:13PM	xwesx	It is not pretty design, though I do like it far better than the new model. It is so imminently practical, though. I could almost ignore the appearance. Deep red does a lot for the looks, IMO, though. A neighbor had one for many years that had a color-matched canopy and a Thule rack atop the canopy / cab roof. It was a decent looking truck, and really quite versatile.
3260	September 12, 2019 10:14PM	stickguy	I do think the new ones are a lot nicer looking.
3261	September 12, 2019 10:23PM	corvette	But they basically look like a Pilot from the front. Nothing wrong with the way the Pilot looks, but it’d be nice if the Ridgeline were better differentiated.
3262	September 12, 2019 10:29PM	stickguy	"well, it is a pilot from the front, so that makes sense! Maybe they will adopt the Passport nose instead. Still just a pilot, but with a blockier more ""butch"" grill and hood. More rugged image, just worse visibility and aerodynamics."

I noticed that Tom has his head and torso stuck out of a sunroof, and it made me wonder if that was a factory option, or if the car was modified for the movie?

We are getting a lot in a campground about 5 minutes outside Sea Isle City, NJ.

This will be our weekend spot!

Not quite the condo in Wildwood Crest we wanted, but much more attainable for now while the kids are little.

Hope to have ready in about 10 days, so we can enjoy the fall down there. It’s a seasonal place April thru November.

Never though I’d own a trailer, but friends of ours have one (very similar) and we enjoyed the atmosphere and our kids love the campground and all it has to offer (pools, lake, playgrounds etc). Not to mention the beach is so close.

I’m hoping to get it paid off in about 7 years, and then maybe we can think buying a condo/house closer to the beach.

Wasn’t sure how much margin there is on these things, but got another 4K off the “blowout “ price and got delivery and setup included. Some people who claim to know pricing said we did very very well."

3275	September 13, 2019 1:09AM	corvette	"@tjc78 congrats on the park model! I've considered those for when I eventually retire, assuming I'm still single. As a primary residence, the narrow width makes the bedroom tight. The loft is a great idea, though, and one like yours with a sunken bedroom and taller loft above the bedroom should really provide a lot of extra room. The mini-split HVAC and loft A/C should be great.

I've also looked into the ""tiny house"" option, and a lot of what I've seen makes it look like people tend to understate the cost, and sometimes use non-standard parts which will be a bear to replace. I'm not really interested in kludges like trying to retrofit a small (but inefficient) RV water heater to work in a tiny house. The least expensive water heater, after discounts, is generally a 40 gallon electric (or a little more for gas), so why not work around that?

I think I'd be fine with a studio-style single family residence modeled after the Home2Suites I recently stayed at, slightly larger, with a connected utility/storage room accessible from the outside, and a patio with a pergola. I'm sure it wouldn't be inexpensive the way I'd want it built, though!"
3276	September 13, 2019 1:19AM	tjc78	Thanks! We plan to build an attached sunroom next year. Most people do that and it adds so much more space. Our friends have one and it’s awesome. Great spot to hang out.

3291	September 13, 2019 3:27PM	28firefighter	On today's agenda: tree trimming. We have 3 60 foot fir trees and 1 60 foot western red cedar that all sit between 6-10 feet from our house. With how bad windy season was last year, we have an arborist here trimming everything back.
3292	September 13, 2019 4:53PM	stickguy	Smart idea based on that math!
3293	September 13, 2019 5:47PM	qbrozen	"yes, $10k.

I bet that 4-cyl Terrain would still easily outgun a Hummer or a Wrangler Unlimited 3.8."
3294	September 13, 2019 5:48PM	qbrozen	yup yup. Trust me, it has been top of mind since we first toured this house.
3295	September 13, 2019 5:54PM	28firefighter	@nyccarguy and @tjc78 - How old were your kids when you turned them forward facing in their car seat?
3296	September 13, 2019 5:55PM	qbrozen	"Thinking things through ...

So I want something with a decent cargo area and at least has the potential to look mean. I'm all about appearance on this truck deal, it would seem.

As I came upon vehicles ...
CX-9, I've decided will NEVER look mean.
Terrain, definitely has potential, but starting to think it could be too small. Not ruled out yet.
Tiguan, certainly on the smaller side.

Then I finally thought of something that I really should have thought of earlier. A 4runner. Could definitely check all the boxes.

3297	September 13, 2019 5:57PM	28firefighter	I know you don't want to lease, but I'm pretty sure the Ally/USBank leases on 4Runners are a great deal. Just a thought.
3298	September 13, 2019 6:03PM	qbrozen	for as little as I'm driving now, it doesn't make sense. I could buy an old 4runner, keep it 18 mos, and maybe lose $2k tops on it. Pretty sure I ain't gettin a $111 lease.
3299	September 13, 2019 6:12PM	nyccarguy	We followed the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. We turned our boys around at 1. We waited until our daughter was 2.
3300	September 13, 2019 6:29PM	28firefighter	The new guidelines recommend rear facing until the max weight or height (whichever comes first). Which at our current pace, means Sam will be rear facing until first grade...
3301	September 13, 2019 6:31PM	kyfdx	Carb loading..
3302	September 13, 2019 6:57PM	tifighter	Did someone say mean-looking SUV (lol)?
3303	September 13, 2019 7:02PM	stickguy	I thought even old 4 runners went for more money. At least should be reliable. And can actually off road! Do they really have that much cargo room?
3304	September 13, 2019 7:03PM	qbrozen	Its only angry because there ain't a power line in sight!
3305	September 13, 2019 7:06PM	ab348	The 4Runners look good, especially the black one. Given their age though, they would need to be gone over with a fine-toothed comb, especially for rust. Same would be true for the Denali.
3306	September 13, 2019 7:14PM	corvette	Yeah, I think one of the reasons my friend in MN dumped his V8 4Runner (of the same vintage) was because of rust.
3307	September 13, 2019 7:20PM	stickguy	It’s a Tacoma frame under there, so that makes sense.
3308	September 13, 2019 7:22PM	qbrozen	"maybe I'll take a peek at an Exploder. Would rather the 4.6, but the only one I have found so far has 20k more miles than this one for the same price.

3309	September 13, 2019 7:33PM	mb_enthusiast	If you could buy a $56k used car for clean trade-in value ($48k), but you had to do it without an inspection, would you do it?
3310	September 13, 2019 7:36PM	28firefighter	What kind of car? I don't think there is any used car I'd buy at that price without an inspection.
3311	September 13, 2019 7:36PM	mb_enthusiast	That's an interesting looking minivan.
3312	September 13, 2019 7:39PM	qbrozen	It depends. $56k could represent a wide range of vehicles, ages, and mileage. As y'all know, I've bought cars with no inspection.
3313	September 13, 2019 7:40PM	stickguy	Not a bad looking exploder. Good option to consider.
3314	September 13, 2019 7:45PM	tjc78	"My son was about 15-16 months when he went to front facing. My daughter was very tiny so she made it a bit longer but still before 2.

My daughter now turns 4 in October and is in a booster (she is skinny but tall). My son is 6 in March and is riding with just a belt. Yes I know that is not Kosher but he is nearly 60 lbs and tall enough the belt is in proper position.

IMO the car seat laws are a bit out of control. I remember riding in the front at 6 years old."
3315	September 13, 2019 7:56PM	stickguy	I probably rode home from the hospital in my mother’s lap.
3316	September 13, 2019 7:56PM	28firefighter	It is a little crazy. My wife wanted to keep him to the max rear facing and I'm just not sure I understand why...
3317	September 13, 2019 8:01PM	thebean	I’m pretty sure I was tossed into a beer case in the back of my fathers pickup.
3318	September 13, 2019 8:11PM	tjc78	It’s pretty uncomfortable for them as they get taller. My daughters legs were hitting the back of seat and scrunched.
3319	September 13, 2019 8:15PM	xwesx	"Agreed. It is all about moderating risk, so do what you're most comfortable doing in terms of timing of those things. IIRC, we had ours in rear facing for around first six months, then were front-facing in the two-piece ""carrier"" style car seat until they outgrew it, after which they were in the five-point front-facing seats to around four or five years old, then we removed the five-point harness and they used the vehicle's seat belt over the front of that seat.

We didn't stop using the full seats until we went on our transcontinental trip in 2013, at which time our daughter was just shy of six (son was nine). Those seats were both too bulky to haul all across the continent, so we bought them each a butt-booster and never looked back. I think they were each around nine or ten when they stopped using those."
3320	September 13, 2019 8:16PM	28firefighter	Sam’s have been that way for probably 6 months. He doesn’t complain and it seems every study says it’s safer. But sheesh it’s inconvenient.
3321	September 13, 2019 11:30PM	nyccarguy	"Guy I’m friendly with has a V8 4 Runner like the ‘04 you posted @qbrozen. Mechanically very sound, but the last time he brought it in the mechanic warned him that it’s starting to rust.

I know it’s common in 4Runners & Tacoma’s of that vintage, but the brine they Pre treat the roads with can’t help matter either."
3322	September 13, 2019 11:31PM	suydam	My kids were way too tall to have ever been in rear seats that long. They were born wearing 6 or 9 month sizes! So if it works for you, I’m sure it’s a good idea.
3323	September 13, 2019 11:47PM	qbrozen	"Rust seems to plague every 4x4 older than 10 yrs around here.

I went to check out the v8 exploder. Bumpers were painted by a toddler. I didn’t bother digging further than that. Walked amongst the many indy car lots on that stretch of road. Only thing that really caught my attention was a 2010 Equinox. Sharp little trucklet. This one had 140k miles so I did not inquire. But it is something I’ll keep an eye out for."
3324	September 14, 2019 1:17AM	stickguy	"you obviously have way more knowledge than me in terms of inspecting cars, and dealing with potential problems.

But, this is the issue I run into every time I try and come up with a cheap used car option. I start looking, and find out what the trash is like in the 7-10K price range, get frustrated, then just buy a new car."
3325	September 14, 2019 1:29AM	stickguy	"saw a nice medium blue X3 today walking across a parking lot after dinner. so pointed out how nice looking a car it was. she agreed, but said it was too light a blue. Which it was, but otherwise nice.

then she pointed at a car across the street and said she liked the color. a gen 1 Edge, in a red/brown/bronze color. I usually love those, but she is not always a fan.

so, learned something today!"
3326	September 14, 2019 1:44AM	andres3	"I know there's a car commercial forum on Edmunds, but I thought this was appropriate for here.

1) It makes me want a new 2020 Audi RS6 Avant badly.
2) It's an extremely well made 6 minute plus car commercial.
3) It tugs on the heartstrings, particularly for newer father's out there.
4) It speaks to your soul deep down for Audi enthusiasts out there.
5) All wagon lovers in the world can appreciate the effort that went into this.
6) The new RS6 is beautiful in my opinion, the way a wagon can be, aggressive, without being bold like a Toyota, but elegant and classy aggression the Audi designers do so well.
7) It gives Americans 600 reasons to buy a wagon, and they all go ""neigh neigh!""

So well done! Bravo Audi."
3327	September 14, 2019 1:59AM	andres3	"The studies I found were very unconvincing and not really full-blooded studies in my opinion. I couldn't find the evidence I was hoping for to back up the conclusions and summaries.

It seems for the horrible to average driver in the US (which is a VERY LOW bar), it makes sense. For better drivers, it might not make sense. The idea is you'll crash into something yourself, front first, rather than more likely to be rear-ended (good drivers are more often rear ended than doing the rear ending). The benefits of rear-facing seem to assume you'll ram something from the front. Obviously, the stresses on the neck are the opposite if you are hit from behind first."

I once purchased a pre-owned $20k Mercedes diesel without my own inspection that ended up needing over $30k worth of work (essentially a new engine, new suspension, and diesel particulate filter). I traded it in when I got the Q8. Lost so much money, but did win a small judgment against the dealership. Illinois law is now such that I could have returned the vehicle."

3339	September 14, 2019 2:04PM	graphicguy	"Had a 4 Runner years ago. I put 50K on it with no issues. Only did required maintenance and nothing failed. Sold it to a neighbor who was communing back and forth to Columbus every day (around 180 miles/day). He put another 100K miles on it. Only did a battery replacement, tires, brakes, required maintenance. Nothing really broke on it.

He gave it to his son, who proceeded to put another 50K on it (while doing dubious maintenance, if any at all) before selling it. No issues at all.

It was rusting, but at 200K miles, I’d say it was/is a great vehicle. You can’t kill them.

Not sure about the current ones, but mine was a tank. Body on frame. An honest to goodness low range, which I used on the deepest snows and to yearly camping vacations to the Smokies.

Slow, relatively thirsty by today’s standards. Still, comfortable and wouldn’t have hesitated to drive it cross country to off road in it."

3342	September 14, 2019 4:06PM	andres3	"Speaking of suspensions, my TTS is getting a new rear suspension assembly. I took it in for a seat heater button not lighting up correctly in the left side vent, and the tech said the TSB on the rear suspension mounts applied to my car (he heard noises that shouldn't be there), so they ordered that as well. Bring in my car a week later, and they call the next day to confirm the need a whole rear shock assembly (from Germany). They said to get comfortable with my old loaner, the '16 A7 TDI that's black on black that I'm borrowing, it could be up to 3 weeks.

While I'm upset they tried to get away with just the mounts, I'm happy to get a fresh set of shocks for the rear. I was just thinking KW Variant 3 Coil-overs might be a nice upgrade. I asked about the fronts and they said they were fine. Apparently the rear threw a code (they are magnetically adjustable). Interestingly, the TSB included a suspension software update (who'd of known, but I guess I should have since they are adjustable electronically and magnetically), I believe it has ended my train of ""don't ask don't tell"" policy regarding my tune. They will cover this one, but the younger newer service adviser (I knew I should have stuck with my old veteran guy), said that Audi USA was getting terrible about paying warranty claims for tuned cars, and he'd likely have to pay for this through his own ""account"" or something like that. I mentioned how the shocks had nothing to do with the tune (though he just gave the tuners another idea to ""tune"" the suspension with software for the track). He said while he didn't agree with Audi USA, that's what they are doing now.

Should have stuck with the adviser that turns a blind eye. Maybe my tech got mad for calling him out on changing fresh Motul 600 brake fluid for the normal dealership stuff, or maybe mentioning the odd brake fluid raised too many flags."
3343	September 14, 2019 4:12PM	ab348	I was in traffic today next to a 1st-gen Ridgeline. I will freely admit that I hated the styling when they first came out. But I guess time heals all wounds, even to the eye, and now that it is just a used car it isn't particularly offensive to me. Certainly not as bad in that way as several other Asian models, not to mention the Aztek. Looking at it objectively, it seems the perfect solution to the set of needs you posted. If you could find a decent one that isn't rusty within in your budget I think that is what I would go for. I would feel much more confident with a decade+ old Honda than some other makes. Were their transmission woes over by the time this one came along?
3344	September 14, 2019 4:20PM	andres3	That would certainly be cheaper to play during the 2020 Superbowl then Audi's 6:40 second spot I linked above. I'd love to see a 6:30 second version at the Superbowl, but how many RS 6's would that cost?

It's a Honda Vamos, made up until 2016. The one I saw looked almost brand-new and was in well cared-for condition, even had wind deflectors on the side windows. Maybe the ideal solution for @qbrozen if he can handle RHD..."

New to me, they now have the Land Rover store (formerly about 3-4 miles down the road, also in a stand alone store) in there too. Not sure what is going on with that building (renovating or selling something else out of it, or just selling it) but it was in a spot with lousy access.

Oh, noticed a lot of new signage for Genesis on the building too (they have always been in there) which is surprising, since last fall I was talking to them and they were supposedly redoing the old CPJ location about a mile or 2 away (huge place that they were already using the service area from). Seemed to make a lot more sense to move Hyundai store up there since it is bigger. So who knows?

plenty of Genisii around. And I saw a delivery happening on a Kona Electric (said electric in big letters on the back).

they did have a couple nice Santa Fes parked out front. They are really growing on me. Nice styling in and out and well equipped. Need to get the wife out to drive one. They had a 2.0t in Lava Orange I loved. sent her a pick, but she wasn't convinced. But she liked the blue one next to it. Daughter thought they looked snappy too.

When they hook up to your OBD2 port they know how many flashes the ECU has received vs how many it should have.

You have to pay to play."

The big problem? The seats are horribly uncomfortable. My back was hurting after all of 2 miles driving it. The manual adjustments simply don’t do enough and there is no lumbar adjustment.

I really wanted to love it but it just didn’t work for me."

Blue over black leather, pretty well-equipped with the Bose stereo. I liked the way it drove - the lack of a turbo was more than made up by for the row-your-own transmission.

3360	September 14, 2019 10:44PM	andres3	"Yes, but nothing says the service advisor or tech can't ignore a TD1 and turn a blind eye to how many flashes are on the counter. Besides, Audi keeps updating the software themselves, they could easily lose count.

There are companies out there that thinks they've outsmarted the system, but the easiest way is to find a tech that turns a blind eye."
3361	September 14, 2019 10:55PM	mjfloyd1	"It is not up to the tech. If it is hooked up to your OBD2 then it is up to Audi corporate. The tech is entirely out of the equation. Audi will not pay the local dealership to perform the repairs (should driveline only).

Some fixes can be done without hooking up to OBD2, but a software update is not one of them.

I wish that you were right but not so much.

Not a single company that upgrades power for Audi by ECU flash will guarantee you that you will not get a TD1. Audi can even detect tuner boxes and give you a TB1."

One is a 2011 Equinox AWD 4-cyl with leather. 120k miles but asking only $4900.

I am slowly going back and forth for info on a ML500 with 91k, but he is asking $9500, which is full retail, so I’m not sure I want to waste my time.

If the Equinox fails, I may go look at a quad cab Dakota. Then a couple of v8 JGC’s are speaking to me. BUT, my time tomorrow is limited, as usual."
3365	September 15, 2019 2:25AM	tjc78	I am thinking JGC may fit the bill perfectly for you. Plus .... and I could be wrong but you definitely have a like for Mopar.
3366	September 15, 2019 3:21AM	stickguy	"here is one they make sound like it is cleaner than the board of health. Price within budget.

3367	September 15, 2019 10:48AM	qbrozen	"Thanks for the find. But when a dealer is using “incentives” on a used car, it is likely one I will avoid:

As low as $7700*

*Internet price reflects $500 Nissan of Turnersville College Grad and all Financing Rebates/Incentives up to $500."

Equinox, if the miles don't bother you, looks clean and pretty cheap."
3370	September 15, 2019 1:00PM	pensfan83	What about a prior gen Pilot?
3371	September 15, 2019 1:57PM	qbrozen	Saw one at the dealer i was at yesterday. Entire truck had been badly repainted.
3372	September 15, 2019 3:31PM	marcogallo1986	@qb good luck on the searching can’t wait to hear about it tomorrow.
3373	September 15, 2019 3:32PM	marcogallo1986	@qb learn the driveway and Friends are coming along very nice.
3374	September 15, 2019 3:34PM	marcogallo1986	@qb I happen to really like the last generation pilot, love the sheep the Boxee style, the third row is so roomie was in the ones my aunts used to have gone to my brothers for four hours and I was fine. Also love the last generation 2005 to 12 pathfinder a lot. Or even an Xterra two. One day would love to get my hands on one not rusty and abused either first or second generation Xterra, although prefer the second generation.
3375	September 15, 2019 3:35PM	marcogallo1986	The last generation liberty I like to, and nitro, I think they might’ve made a third one the aspirin based on those two but not sure how those look.
3376	September 15, 2019 3:35PM	marcogallo1986	Unfortunately those FJ cruiser nice to put their way overpriced if no one wanted them they wouldn’t be purchased because everyone wants them they’re overpriced just like the used wrangler we overpriced because everyone wants them main reason.
3377	September 15, 2019 3:39PM	marcogallo1986	@ stink guy happy belated anniversary to you and your wife. Love those Santa Fe’s to set up a few other dealers recently love them. When you’re ready either buy or lease if lease to try to go through a broker probably will do better maybe what do you all think. If by I know you know what to do.
3378	September 15, 2019 3:39PM	marcogallo1986	@ Fabian, love that Honda that they don’t unfortunately sell here love the maxi style.
3379	September 15, 2019 7:09PM	qbrozen	Punch #2 complete. I figure I can’t go all that wrong for $4300. Seems to be in excellent mechanical shape. Just needs a good bit of cosmetic polishing.
3380	September 15, 2019 7:16PM	stickguy	nice. and you got a Hemi Daytona and a clean looking CUV for hauling crap around, all for the price of a Ford Fiesta.
3381	September 15, 2019 7:30PM	28firefighter	Interesting plays, @qbrozen. Curious to see how happy you are with this stable.
3382	September 15, 2019 7:47PM	carnaught	@qbrozen, enjoy!
3383	September 15, 2019 7:47PM	stickguy	at these price points, and since he can DIY most anything, not much in the way of exposure. You get bored of one, cut it loose!
3384	September 15, 2019 7:48PM	jmonroe1	"@qbrozen, from the Burgh it looks pretty good but I know you want to put your hands all over it.

Good luck with it.

3385	September 15, 2019 8:07PM	mb_enthusiast	The problem with the Mercedes AIRMATIC suspensions, for me, is that they cost so much. The factory warranty on them is like a year or three years—it's something ridiculous. Arnotts have a lifetime warranty, but the parts are still extremely pricey and independent mechanics run about $120/hour in my area. Add in ADS or Active Curve, you are easily $6k+ for a total replacement.
3386	September 15, 2019 9:11PM	corvette	@qbrozen nice looking Equinox! Is that an LS or LT? I thought only LT had leather seats, but they could be aftermarket.
3387	September 15, 2019 10:12PM	marcogallo1986	@ stink guy happy belated anniversary to you and your wife. Love those Santa Fe’s to set up a few other dealers recently love them.

3388	September 15, 2019 10:14PM	marcogallo1986	@qb con-grads on the second punch!
3389	September 15, 2019 11:53PM	qbrozen	"It's a rather odd configuration. I also thought only LT had leather, but these really don't seem to be aftermarket. No moonroof or anything else. VIN comes up as an LS. I don't get it. It definitely has the BT package, though.

So far, I've already ordered a front push bar and replacement headlights with black buckets. Only $300 total. I know I'll get some hate, but I plan on blacking out the wheels (unless I have another set that will fit) and other chrome bits. I am going to figure out how to raise it up a little and then slap on oversized M/T tires. Maybe a roof basket and extra lights, too. mwuhahahah."
3390	September 15, 2019 11:55PM	qbrozen	going for a look kind of like this.
3391	September 16, 2019 12:08AM	stickguy	so, basically, you are going into your second childhood?
3392	September 16, 2019 12:10AM	ab348	I'm sure that rip-roaring 2.4L Ecotec will buy loads of street cred.
3393	September 16, 2019 12:12AM	stickguy	"just put a 4"" tailpipe opening on it. all you need."
3394	September 16, 2019 12:36AM	nyccarguy	Congrats on punch #2 @qbrozen !
3395	September 16, 2019 12:53AM	pensfan83	Bring that bad boy west and well find some trails
3396	September 16, 2019 12:53PM	qbrozen	"obviously, that rogue is quite the exaggeration. lol.

The 2.4 really ain't all that bad. More power than pretty much any economy car. Yeah, OK, its 3900 lb. It actually reminds me A LOT of our first gen Forester. Very quick off the line, but passing at speed takes a great deal of planning. I will say it makes good noise. My son keeps commenting it sounds very racy from within the cabin when I step on it."
3397	September 16, 2019 2:08PM	graphicguy	Q....nice punch #2. You’ve been quite the wheeler-dealer. Big congrats!
3398	September 16, 2019 2:12PM	tjc78	"I’ve driven one of that vintage. The 4 isn’t bad at all. Cruises at high speed just fine and enough torque to get you moving.

Keep us posted on the progress."
3399	September 16, 2019 2:27PM	stickguy	"When does the Daytona arrive? That should cure the passing power problem.

Could easily go pick it up. Short flight from EWR to Norfolk, then 5-6 hour trip back to see what you got."
3400	September 16, 2019 2:52PM	qbrozen	"tomorrow or Wed, I think.

I looked at all options and they didn't make any financial sense. I'm paying only $300 for transport."
3401	September 16, 2019 2:59PM	pensfan83	"The Prelude's CEL goes back to a knock sensor, very odd since performance hasn't been affected. Connections were checked/tightened and the code cleared. So far the CEL hasn't illuminated so it's possible it was a loose connection to the computer.

After that was resolved the drivers window and door lock controls stopped working. Found that appears to be the result of pinched wires because when the door is fully open they work fine, when closed...nope. Since the door panels were off for the front speaker install I suspect a wire loom just needs repositioned. The shop that did the install said they would take care of it so tomorrow it goes there."
3402	September 16, 2019 3:03PM	stickguy	$300 is cheap. It would cost more to fly down and drive back.
3403	September 16, 2019 3:20PM	breld	Congrats Q!

Congrats times 2 !

Not even ONE punch this year..."
3405	September 16, 2019 4:27PM	stickguy	Odds are I am punch free too. I just hope the wife’s work slows done enough in another month or two that we can take a “date day” to go out looking. Can’t be too hard, with only 5 cars on the shopping list!
3406	September 16, 2019 4:45PM	pensfan83	I'll have at least one in 2020 (TLX) and one in 2021 (Tacoma) when leases mature.
3407	September 16, 2019 4:53PM	stickguy	2021 I am a lock!
3408	September 16, 2019 4:55PM	28firefighter	Mine will happen just as soon as I find something that excites me enough to pull the trigger. By definition it will need to happen by the end of December.
3409	September 16, 2019 5:19PM	stickguy	I got a shopping date with my daughter to go pick out something for my wife.
3410	September 16, 2019 5:44PM	laurasdada	"Congrats Q!
Crap, I filled the XF up last Thursday night, CEL came on Friday. Last time, a couple of months ago, had the code read, it was the Evap system read. But, I was hoping it was simply I didn't tighten the gas cap a full three clicks; and indeed the CEL extinguished a couple of days later. So, again hoping gas cap, which I also inspected, seems OK, but now when I start the car, the RPMs jump up to ~3k and then fall back to normal idle. Don't know if that's related...

So, if it's Evap system, that'll probably be ~$800+, rear signal (used part) ~$200. Plus six year maintenance in December, do I want to invest in the beauty? I'll figure it out after Caribbean Cruise, hoping that Mike is still working on proper weather..."
3411	September 16, 2019 7:52PM	xwesx	It could be deteriorated rubber: either the seal on the cap or a hose, etc. pitching fits. Yours is not an old car at that age, but they do start to remind you they're machines.
3412	September 16, 2019 8:52PM	laurasdada	"Aye, with age comes aches... Not an issue (hopefully), I just think back to keeping the Lexus alive for a few too many years and a few too many $$$.
First world problems."
3413	September 16, 2019 9:19PM	nyccarguy	Things aren’t going well for my wife’s job hunting. She applied for unemployment and received a letter today saying that they determined she was fired due to “deliberate misconduct...”. She’s a mess. She’s applying for jobs, but is finding out she was making in the higher side of the pay scale in our area for her profession and experience. So we’ve got 7ish weeks of her PTO and then our income gets cut by about 40%.
3414	September 16, 2019 9:31PM	qbrozen	Have you consulted a lawyer?
3415	September 16, 2019 9:32PM	28firefighter	"Can she appeal that decision? I'm not familiar with unemployment law in CT.

May be worth looking into an employment attorney since something doesn't smell right based on what you're telling us."
3416	September 16, 2019 9:33PM	28firefighter	Also we were just here, as you know, and a similar pay hit. Hang tough and feel free to PM if you want to chat.
3417	September 16, 2019 9:42PM	mb_enthusiast	Is she a nurse?
3418	September 16, 2019 10:06PM	stickguy	that sucks Bradd. did sound like a weird situation. Maybe someone up the food chain screwed up, and pinned the blame on her? Also makes it hard to look since even if it was bogus, still has the record. So might have to eat the paycut to get back into action.
3419	September 16, 2019 11:06PM	nyccarguy	"Things aren’t going well for my wife’s job hunting. She applied for unemployment and received a letter today saying that they determined she was fired due to “deliberate misconduct No. She’s a physical therapist. Thanks for listening guys. It really means a lot. I know she’ll be OK, but it is so hard to see the person that your world revolves around be in such an awful state of mind. She’s doing a good job at forcing herself out of bed every day. This is nothing compared to what @mb_enthusiast is going through with his dad or @qbrozen ‘s parents both dying so close.

I think our next step is to consult a lawyer. I fear it might be frivolous. The letter from the state says she was discharged for “willful misconduct.” In the attached sheet, it says “Wilful misconduct means deliberate misconduct in willful disregard of the employer’s interest, or a single knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule or policy of the employer, when reasonably applied, provided such violation is not a result of the employee’s incompetence.”"
3420	September 16, 2019 11:18PM	Michaell	"Not a lawyer, but I'm sure a competent one could focus on the words ""deliberate"" and ""willful"".

As I believe you explained it, it was human error, not deliberate. It's not like your wife said ""I'm going to take care of this patient, despite what the chart says"".

And, it's also possible that the wording is such to frighten former staff from pursuing legal recourse."
3421	September 17, 2019 1:04AM	sda	It sounds like a knee jerk reaction to me, typical cya. I wish the best for your wife and family.
3422	September 17, 2019 1:45AM	xwesx	"At least consult with one. I don't mean it in this way, but, from what you describe, this fall's squarely in the category of ""employee's incompetence,"" therefore willful misconduct does not apply. Willful assumes intent, whereas ""incompetence"" = ""human error."" There's no reason not to own such a mistake, she just needs to not internalize it as though it somehow defines her or her ability to move forward."
3423	September 17, 2019 2:04AM	nyccarguy	She has consulted with a lawyer. The guy was very empathetic to her situation & told her that he doesn’t think it would be worth it to sue because the hospital has lawyers on retainer and has endless resources. She’s going to call him tomorrow and inquire about unemployment.
3424	September 17, 2019 2:08AM	nyccarguy	Believe me. I’ve been telling her that for the last 2 1/2 weeks. One moment doesn’t define her. I’ve told her to look at the thousands of people she’s helped over the years. I told her they can take away her job, but not her degree & not her experience.
3425	September 17, 2019 2:33AM	sda	And not those she has helped make their lives better. She can hold her head high and know she has made a positive experience for those she’s touched.
3426	September 17, 2019 3:23AM	28firefighter	"When I was in the ICU a couple years ago, the Physical Therapist on my case was the only one who got me up out of bed and moving again after two weeks of being bedridden. I credit them with getting me back to the point I could walk out of the hospital on my own.

I’m sure your wife has many patients with similar experiences. Make sure she remembers that."
3427	September 17, 2019 3:25AM	stickguy	sadly, the 100's you go above and beyond to help or save don't count. Just the one that might make someone up the chain look bad or complain to the hospital.
3428	September 17, 2019 10:42AM	omarman	"1. Redact all personal/identifying information from your notes and write a book about trying to provide quality and continuity of healthcare in a world which rewards dreck.
2. If writing about your profession hasn't blunted your passion then start your own PT practice. (Because you're not going to make any money on that book.)
3. I highly support building the ""I love me"" wall for all good soldiers in healthcare. Include every award and degree.

Don't forget to add your anger management completion certificate. I'd definitely hang that one on the wall if ever I complete it."
3429	September 17, 2019 12:03PM	Billingsgate	We had 5 and anyways planning to buy another one once the resources are available.
3430	September 17, 2019 1:20PM	marcogallo1986	@ New York car guy, sorry to hear about all the trouble with your wife’s having to find another job I know this all too well, it’s good she’s getting out of bed and doing what she has to do everyday! Glad your wife is not letting a job define her who she is and all the people she’s helped over the years. I’m glad she consulted with a lawyer to, as you know always here for you your wife anyone else in this group who is a phone call away if they need someone to talk to seriously guys. Everyone enjoy the day and make the best of it. By the way not selling the Thunderbird thought about it would be foolish and I would be happy with anything new just doesn’t get driven as much as I like it is what it is.
3431	September 17, 2019 1:22PM	marcogallo1986	I didn’t like dealing with the unemployment when I had to for the six months what a nightmare and all the hell they put you through, and for me the technology to use was even accessible so I couldn’t go I just went for the meetings to show that I was looking for work ha ha. And they’re always so miserable and rude over here at least. My man be thankful you have a job people but that’s on them being cranky and miserable. Just look at the department of motor vehicle they usually all miserable for some reason.
3432	September 17, 2019 1:26PM	marcogallo1986	@ stick guy when is the shopping day with your daughter look at cars for the wife?
3433	September 17, 2019 1:27PM	marcogallo1986	@qb Nice on the upgrades for the equinox, glad to hear of the 2.4 isn’t all that bad you would think from what you hear over the Internet it’s horrible, I’ve never been in one of those to experience it always like to experience things for myself. I’m sure like all of you in here due to uncle based on what you hear or read on the Internet. But glad the toner is arriving later this week to as well, $300 is cheap for transport not bad. I had paid a couple years back a little more than that to ship my Thunderbird from upstate New York might’ve been 500.
3434	September 17, 2019 1:28PM	marcogallo1986	@qb what’s going on with the old car that you have?
3435	September 17, 2019 1:53PM	nyccarguy	Thanks to all who have reached out to me here and privately. I greatly appreciate it!

Speaking of which, I'm driving the Elantra this week as I have the Enclave packed to the gills for stuff that I'm taking to the campground. Unit is being delivered on Thursday afternoon. Heading down there mid day to sign for it and then taking off Friday to start setting stuff up.

I want to build a nice set of stairs and a fire pit, grab two mattresses for the loft, hang TVs, then be back home for 5 to load up again and bring the wife and kids down. Wife really wanted to be there Friday, but she is launching a new platform this week at work and can't break away.

So it looks to be a busy few days!! Weather looks great Sat and Sun so want to get some beach time in too."

Either way, enjoy your time! It will be busy, but also good memories."
3449	September 17, 2019 8:06PM	stickguy	Good luck. Curious, since the campground is seasonal, does that mean you can’t get to work the home once they shut Down? Or is it the facilities only closed?

3465	September 17, 2019 10:24PM	28firefighter	Whoa! Congrats @nyccarguy! Did we bid a fond farewell to the Infiniti?
3466	September 17, 2019 10:25PM	tjc78	Congrats !! Nice truck.

3468	September 17, 2019 10:34PM	mb_enthusiast	I've now seen three Q8s today alone. I usually see 1-2 per week. I guess the MF drop to .00139 did the trick, eh, @Michaell? Perhaps this means it is time to find something new...? After all, the service advisor today asked me what I was going to do once my lease was up. I only have like 30 months left.
3469	September 17, 2019 10:40PM	mb_enthusiast	Are the sales figures on CarSalesBase.com accurate? I've been meaning to ask this.
3470	September 17, 2019 10:42PM	nyccarguy	The Infiniti is being sold to Carvana. They are picking up on Sunday.
3471	September 17, 2019 11:53PM	corvette	Congrats @nyccarguy! Way to surprise us--I thought you had decided to keep the Q40.
3472	September 17, 2019 11:53PM	stickguy	welcome to the sell to Carvana crowd! I think that makes 4 of us now.
3473	September 18, 2019 12:03AM	nyccarguy	I decided to go for the Tacoma. The broker from lease hackr gave me a fantastic price on a nicely equipped Tacoma (Auto/Premium/Tech/Tonneau) Double Cab Short Bed 4X4 in black. This was one of the easiest and transparent automotive deals I’ve ever made. The broker gives me the price and then negotiates on my behalf. The dealership delivered the Tacoma to the DMV Closest to my house. We registered it, got plates, put them on and I was ready to go in about an hour.
3474	September 18, 2019 12:24AM	pensfan83	Looks great, enjoy it!
3475	September 18, 2019 12:30AM	stickguy	"nice deal. maybe next time I will get brave and go the broker route.

do they negotiate buy deals too, or just leases?"

3478	September 18, 2019 1:30AM	corvette	"Any of you guys install a composite deck lately? My contractor recommends Trex, and I've ordered some samples, but I'm not wedded to that brand yet.

So much for paying the HELOC down to zero in the next couple of months... Still, I'd rather invest in a longer lasting deck than replace the deteriorated boards and restain the existing one."
3479	September 18, 2019 1:38AM	stickguy	I am obsessed on finally getting the HELOC down to zero. trying to avoid major house expenses, just doing small stuff pay as you go. Got the rest of my bad trim replaced and capped this week, and in the next week should be getting a runner put on the stairs.
3480	September 18, 2019 1:59AM	nyccarguy	My rails and spindles are Azec. I really wanted to have the whole deck made of that stuff, but it would have been a lot more money. Even my painter (who I am supposed to pay to stain and re stain every 3-5ish years) told me to do the deck in Azec.
3481	September 18, 2019 2:01AM	pensfan83	Pretty sure most on LH will do either. There's some really good ones in NY/NJ too. For right deal I'd have no problem using one.
3482	September 18, 2019 2:02AM	nyccarguy	I assume they do buy deals as well. How many times have you walked into a dealership and known more about the car you are interested in than the sales dude? How many times have you wished that the dealer would just give their very best price off the bat? It was really just that easy.
3483	September 18, 2019 2:09AM	stickguy	OK, I am sold.
3484	September 18, 2019 2:44AM	corvette	I was looking at the papers for the G37 the other night, and realized the lender (with whom I now have my checking account, natch ) charged a bunch of start-up fees (prepaid finance charge, etc.) as part of the loan. Would have been way better off to write a HELOC check and either keep the borrowed money there, or then go with Penfed or another lender which charges minimal fees. Will look into that the next time I buy.
3485	September 18, 2019 4:05AM	Michaell	@stickguy - for the first time since my kids started to drive, there are no cars parked on the street. When @breld came to pick me up last Saturday, he commented that he was glad I was waiting out front, as he didn't know what house was mine without the Jetta parked in front of it.
3486	September 18, 2019 5:41AM	breld	"Congrats @nyccarguy!

There’s something special about these trucks. I plan on borrowing @jpp75’s Tacoma some time in the next few weeks in order to empty my storage unit into the new house.

I’m a little afraid I’ll enjoy it so much that I’ll join the taco club."
3487	September 18, 2019 10:35AM	qbrozen	Congrats on the rig, @nyccarguy
3488	September 18, 2019 11:40AM	kyfdx	"Depending on the size, I recommend AZEK decking (PVC). Composite decking is definitely not maintenance free. We did ours about six years ago, and I haven't thought about it since. Yes, it's more expensive, but worth every penny, IMO.

Of course, if your deck is 20' X 35', it might be cost prohibitive.

I think AZEK is owned by Timbertech (sp) now.

EDIT: We did powder-coated aluminum rails. Looks good with the AZEK and cost-effective/maintenance-free."
3489	September 18, 2019 11:43AM	kyfdx	"@nyccarguy Congrats! Looks great!

If you can wait until June, I'll give you the Predator steps off of my son's Tacoma. That's when his lease is up."
3490	September 18, 2019 12:12PM	tjc78	"I would have used a broker for the Volvo, I even spoke with one on the phone. Turned out I matched the deal myself but it certainly wasn't easy. I emailed quite a few dealers, had to explain how I came to my price etc.

The dealer I did end up buying from was awesome in every way, just too far.

Broker really really simplifies the process."
3491	September 18, 2019 12:22PM	pensfan83	"We thought about composite decking but for what we wanted to do the cost was exorbitant. Our project consisted of a tear down to just the piers and then rebuilding the flooring, lower deck, and adding a gable roof to the upper deck. We added power outlets and pre-wired for a TV too.

We also went with powdercoated aluminum for the railings and roof pillars."
3492	September 18, 2019 12:37PM	nyccarguy	I might take you up on that!
3493	September 18, 2019 12:52PM	stickguy	Can’t wait to here the recap of the first round trip commute, compared to using the Q40
3494	September 18, 2019 1:36PM	nyccarguy	"Thanks guys for the well wishes on my new truck! It really does look sharp. I was supposed to get a short bed, but I didn't. So I will put the Long Bed to good use.

So far, so good. The ride is definitely on the choppy side. The truck is very well screwed together. No squeaks or rattles at all. Everything just works right. Wireless charging, The phone connects perfectly to the blue tooth, voice prompts to change the radio don't ask me to repeat myself. The Blind Spot Monitors are helpful. The adaptive cruise works perfect (much better than in our Pilot)

The power is definitely adequate. It's nowhere near the road rocket that my Q40 is, but I had no issues merging on to 95 this AM. Brakes are strong and surprisingly easy to modulate.

I have to get used to the size. I can't squirt my way in like I can in the Q40. I turned it off and the TC said I got 18 mpg on the 29 mile trip in. I'll most likely have to fill up tomorrow."
3495	September 18, 2019 1:43PM	stickguy	At least this beast runs on regular.
3496	September 18, 2019 1:56PM	tjc78	"I really would like to have a truck but just not for my everyday commute.

My wife (believe this or not) said she wouldn't mind a truck for a DD .... so maybe when the Enclave goes back I could convince her.

In a perfect world.... I could have the Volvo (or something like it), a nice truck and then an older Panther for my land yacht ""fix"",

I saw a pristine 95-97 Black over Grey LTC sig for sale over the weekend. I wouldn't throw that out of the driveway.

Not sure the wife would go for the three car approach....but I went for the Trailer so maybe I have some leverage. At the very least my third car would be cheap!"
3497	September 18, 2019 1:58PM	tjc78	OR... pickup a screaming lease deal on a truck AND another small sedan. I'd wager for the payment on a three row SUV it could be a similar monthly cost (other than insurance)
3498	September 18, 2019 1:59PM	stickguy	"The dealer in town here has a nice blue 2001 TC. even has a moonroof. Just over 100k miles, and only $2,500.

3499	September 18, 2019 2:03PM	stickguy	"Every time I make the jughandle in front of the ford dealer I see the row of Rangers. I really like the looks of those, and size is manageable.

Tom, you (well your wife) sounds like perfect candidate for a ridgeline.

I would love an old truck as a sort of toy. If I had a place to park it. I had a 1991 Nissan king cab for about a year, right when we bought out first house, and that came in handy. If I finally buy an old place to fix up (flip or downsize into) I would definitely pick up another truck."
3500	September 18, 2019 2:06PM	tjc78	"Exactly... cheap. In all reality it would be 95-97 or 2003-04. The 98-02 is largely unloved and I agree

Nice color on that one"
3501	September 18, 2019 2:06PM	stickguy	They all look like barges to me
3502	September 18, 2019 2:08PM	tjc78	"I miss having my S10.

Ridgeline ... hmm yes that would probably be perfect. Having a pickup bed would be a big help with our new campground living for the weekends."
3503	September 18, 2019 2:09PM	stickguy	You can also tow modest trailers if need be
3504	September 18, 2019 2:10PM	tjc78	Well they are ... here is what the one I saw looked like. I swear up and down if/when I get another at least it won't have a cloth/vinyl top!!
3505	September 18, 2019 2:18PM	ab348	From time to time I find myself wondering why no manufacturer has revived the idea of building a subcompact pickup off a FWD platform like VW and Chrysler did in the '80s. Those were ahead of their time IMO. Not everyone wants something as big as a Colorado, Ranger or Tacoma.
3506	September 18, 2019 2:28PM	stickguy	"Hyundai seems to be coming out with one. Not sure how big it really is.

I think a big reason though is people want more room, and seats, in the cab. A rabbit PU was really tight."
3507	September 18, 2019 2:37PM	28firefighter	"If I could park it in my garage, a Tacoma would be on the list given the price point it hits. Alas, the HVAC and Hot Water tank are on my side of the garage so a 212"" truck (at shortest) is decidedly not going to fit."
3508	September 18, 2019 2:48PM	graphicguy	Q....nice punch #2. You’ve been quite the wheeler-dealer. Big congrats! I'm slipping. I didn't even know you were in the market. Beautiful Truck. Big congrats!
3509	September 18, 2019 3:40PM	pensfan83	"That's exactly why having a truck works well for us. My commute is a few miles 3 days/week to a park & ride, we still have a sporty sedan that both of us enjoy driving, and of course the Prelude is around 7.5 months of the year.

And my wife has surprised me by taking the truck at least one of the days I work from home and sometimes on the weekend as well."

3512	September 18, 2019 6:24PM	jmonroe1	"That is a problem. You should have bought a bigger place.

jmonroe"
3513	September 18, 2019 6:26PM	tjc78	"ha ha..

It depends on the layout. Some have room for 60"" since there aren't cabinets above."
3514	September 18, 2019 6:33PM	jmonroe1	"C'mon man, the only way you could get a 60 inch job in that spot without the cabinet would be to mount it vertically.

jmonroe"
3515	September 18, 2019 7:14PM	tjc78	Ok Ok ... different layouts entirely! Ours is an end kitchen layout, some models have the kitchen in the middle which gives a bigger living room and wall for giant TV.

JM, take a number. I live maybe an hour from there. I expect they will just give me my own key."
3521	September 18, 2019 9:16PM	ab348	I'm confused. You mentioned a campground, which I assumed meant a trailer. But that looks like a house.
3522	September 18, 2019 9:42PM	tjc78	It’s called a park model. Basically a 12’ x 35’ mini house on wheels. Meant to be placed once and done. We will add on a sunroom kit to it next year.
3523	September 19, 2019 1:23AM	xwesx	I am so sad for you.
3524	September 19, 2019 2:45AM	andres3	"I always hated the track homes of the 90's and early 2000's that had built in insets in living rooms for TV's, either an alcove or an inset shelf wrapped in drywall usually. They all struck me as way too small, and with no room for future expansion. A 42"" HD TV was hot stuff in 2002, but nowadays I think people must have remodeled due to such a horrible design. They also never left room for speakers."
3525	September 19, 2019 2:54AM	corvette	"My parents remodeled their basement in the early 1990s and had custom built bookcases with a cutout for one specific rear-projection Mitsubishi big screen TV. Thankfully, the TV lasted until they sold the house. I guess you could have put a TV stand inside the cutout and set a modern flat screen on the stand and it probably would have looked okay.

2000, they built a new house, and finished the basement in 2005 or so. Another custom built enclosure for (I think) a Sony DLP television to make it flush with the wall. They were not so lucky this time, the TV died. They hung a larger Samsung flat screen over the wall opening. Water damaged their home theater subwoofer and I had to find one with a very different (smaller) enclosure to fill the space they had designed around the original one."
3526	September 19, 2019 4:20AM	xwesx	"Such a good point, @andres3. As corvette noted, sometimes it works out, but usually these features do not stand the test of time. I built a ""headboard"" for the bed I had as a teen (which I also built). It was an ambitious design that incorporated openings for my tower Infiniti speakers. Sadly, I no longer have the headboard, but I do still have the speakers! Purchased in July of 1991, they remain excellent.

My woodshop instructor mentioned that I probably should not build the piece to such a specific purpose. In my case, it worked out very well because the furniture was lost in a fire, so they never outlasted their intended use. Had that never happened, I would still have it with those speakers still neatly installed."
3527	September 19, 2019 12:54PM	corvette	"My parents’ neighbors had a custom built chest at the foot of their bed with a motorized rig that would drop a tube style TV into the chest and hide it. I’m sure that’s long gone, now.

My great aunt and great uncle built a house in the 1970s and it still had the 1970s era intercom system (no longer working), bathroom heaters in the walls, and central vacuum system (still worked) at the time the last of them passed away."
3528	September 19, 2019 1:24PM	kyfdx	"We have a custom built entertainment center in our finished lower level.
I didn't have it made for a specific flat panel, but did make sure it would fit a 52"" LCD model (which was pretty big in 2009).

It's a very nice Sony with 1080p. But, cases have become so thin, that I could fit a 60"" in there now (but not 65""). A couple of years ago, when they were phasing out the 60"" size, I almost bought a new 4K set, just because... But, the Sony is still going strong, and since my son moved out, we rarely go down there."

3530	September 19, 2019 1:49PM	stickguy	"Sharp. Looks brand new. And much different than the BMW!

Now go do a burnout down your new driveway."
3531	September 19, 2019 1:53PM	qbrozen	"hahaha. Wife is home today, so it will have to wait.

Another topic of interest: insurance. Geico is actually charging me LESS for these 2 vehicles together vs the one BMW. And, no, I didn't change coverage. For once, insurance actually makes sense since covering one driver between two cars totalling $15k SHOULD be cheaper than that same one driver in one $50k car. Just a data point for those of you who have considered two for one and worry about added costs. The extra insurance was one of my wife's arguments, which I have now proven incorrect. The other was maintenance, but as I always point out, you aren't driving more miles, so the maintenance doesn't theoretically increase (unless you are battling age-related issues, but don't tell me wife that)."
3532	September 19, 2019 1:57PM	28firefighter	"My wife's argument against more cars was insurance AND why do I need 2+ cars...

Looks really nice @qbrozen! 2am delivery though? Yeesh! Any plans to swap out that old headunit?"
3533	September 19, 2019 2:01PM	stickguy	"I found that with insurance when I dropped the kid and got my new car before selling the prior one. Insurance on the 3rd car, even though new, was much less than the other 2 cars since only 2 drivers. So a selling point for adding to the fleet.

My wife doesn’t care, as long as I don’t try and take her garage bay away. I have to stay on my side of the driveway."
3534	September 19, 2019 2:13PM	qbrozen	"oh no. The old Uconnect is a great system. No plans for swapping right now. I'll have to experiment, but my wife's '08 T&C with uconnect worked very well with Siri, so as long as this is the same, carplay isn't necessary.

Oh, pleasant surprise, the PO put in the K&N cone intake, but put all the original parts in the K&N box and put it in the trunk. Good indication it was a well cared for car."
3535	September 19, 2019 2:14PM	tjc78	Looks great Q. Enjoy it.
3536	September 19, 2019 2:22PM	nyccarguy	Love the color & the car! Great Job @qbrozen !

Nice looking car -- I'll add my belated congratulations to all the others. Use it in good health.

I really like orange cars, and it looks like yours is the same shade as my beloved '73 240Z that I drove out of the showroon with 3.4 miles on it in Edmonton; it served me for 224K miles. Hope you have similar good luck with yours, though I know no one on this board (except for RB) would be caught dead driving the same vehicle anywhere near that many miles."
3538	September 19, 2019 2:31PM	pensfan83	"Looks great, and I'm impressed with the condition too. Glad to see I'm not the only one here who bought a car sight unseen lol.

P.S. We have that same shed."

I have a really good set, but they are full-on Blizzaks, and they just about drove me nuts, last year. I was used to ""performance"" winter tires.

So, looking for hatchback, CUV or wagon.
Under 100K miles
Stick-shift preferred
FWD or AWD
Under $6K (so, no collision or comp. insurance)
I would take a sedan, under duress, or an automatic

pickings are slim

This seems like a great option, vs. spending $700 for a different set of winter tires, right?

Would probably be even better if I had bothered to make a base for it rather than just building it on the grass, but no complaints, really, and large enough for my john deere with plow attached and riding mower parked end-to-end with enough room beside them for 4 bikes and a bunch of other junk

3558	September 19, 2019 5:13PM	Sandman6472	"This website is f’ing nuts!!! I changed my password on my tablet and all is well and good. On my laptop, totally different story. After 10 attempts, it won’t recognize me like my tablet does. W T F!!!
Have no clue as to why this is the only website that my laptop refuses to recognize me. I’m about to just say adios, thanks to my Latin co-workers, because it shouldn’t be so hard to get recognized on any device, and mine are all Apple. Very frustrated here!"
3559	September 19, 2019 5:19PM	kyfdx	I like the “cool” choices, but think I’ll get more bang for the buck with a utilitarian choice. 9-2X and C30 are both right up my alley, but probably won’t meet my goal of being cheap enough to forego collision/comp.
3560	September 19, 2019 5:24PM	Sandman6472	"Got new sneakers for the Golf on Monday, Eagle Sports by Goodyear. So far...so good. They said my alignment was out on three of the wheels so Tires Plus just did a new 4-wheel one this morning. Drives great now! The installation bonus at Goodyear was supposed to be $25 but it changed on Monday to $60, taken right off the bill. There’s also a $100 rebate in the form of a Visa gift card that I need to apply for later today. Only reason I went with Goodyear this time as Tires Plus couldn’t touch the rebate so saving $40 overall on each tire was to good to pass up. I also got the road hazard and all that crap so it was nice to have the rebates to be honest. And praying that this I’ll be the last set of sneakers I ever buy for this vehicle!
The wife and middle girl are taking a road trip tomorrow to Georgia so the Accent is at T P getting an oil change/rotation and a general look see at the belts and hoses as the vehicle is 11 already and they might leave the A3 at home for this trip. Since the A3 has cruise control and has XM, think the Accent will eventually stay in the garage at home with me. Makes more sense to take the Audi really as it had a recall done yesterday plus the 55K service at Ft. Lauderdale Audi, so it’s all set for road trip. I’m staying out of this as it’s the smart thing to do. All I know is I’ll be home alone for a week. But getting the driveway done and hopefully the side walkway repaired. The painting of the garage floor has been postponed till next year. First things first."
3561	September 19, 2019 5:31PM	breld	"We're pretty much all settled into our new house - the official move date was almost two weeks ago now. The rather unfortunate circumstance of owning both homes for about six weeks at least gave us time to do a gradual move and get things ready at the new house prior to the whole family moving in.

The biggest thing was getting the landscaping all done prior to move-in. We went from no yard to half an acre - at first, we were intimidated but once we got some ideas from our landscaper, we now see it as an extension of the home."
3562	September 19, 2019 5:32PM	breld	"And of course, I was anxious to get the garage all organized right away to house the vehicles and other ""garage"" stuff."
3563	September 19, 2019 5:34PM	breld	And I really like our new dog kennel and dog run. We've done this in three houses now, but I have to say, I really put thought into this one and took the time to build it the way I wanted it.
3564	September 19, 2019 5:35PM	stickguy	Nice. But you appear to be way out on the prairie, and that isn’t a little house!
3565	September 19, 2019 5:37PM	marcogallo1986	@breld Nice play to move into your new house is finally complete, are you done with the other house probably a lot less stressful now having one house instead of two. But yes at least you were able to gradually moving. You’re nice you have a lot more land now I’m sure yes was there for me overwhelming at first until the landscaper gave you some good ideas. Thanks for giving us an update. Do you have more room for a bigger driveway there more pours ha ha Ha. Trying to get my cousin to go with me and look at a 5.0 Mustang green 1991 automatic. Tempted to try to trade my car for that or some kind of deal like that but he won’t go look at the car with me he supposed to Let me know for sure, but he’s superstitious and got a green card from auction it was a lot of problems so any green car he doesn’t want to go near I told him that’s ridiculous you just got a bad car it’s an auction that’s what happens sometimes. You get the lemon drop in to anyone I said I really want to go check out this mustang he told me a stock and clean in the box of things so want to check it out thoroughly. But I’m asking or with someone else that knows what they’re looking at I don’t know happened to find it last night while on cars.com looking at local dealers when I was wide awake until six this morning couldn’t sleep.
3566	September 19, 2019 5:38PM	marcogallo1986	@sandman Nice I’m getting the new tires for the golf, nice I’m having some alone time for a week and getting things done at the house that’s awesome.
3567	September 19, 2019 5:38PM	breld	"And finally, a quick pic of the house itself. We went from a 3 story (plus basement) contemporary home near the city to this large ranch in the suburbs. There are a few things we miss about the old place, but it's all overshadowed by the great advantages of our new area and house. Not the least of which is being closer to my high school age boys' high school and all their activities. Well, in fact, that's the whole reason we did the move, and just in the couple weeks we've been here, my wife and I can't believe we didn't do it sooner.

It's been a long process - we put our previous home on the market in January, hoping it would sell in the Spring.
We ended up closing our new home in early July without a buyer for the old home. But it all worked out with the closing on the sale last Friday. The sense of relief is hard to quantify.

Thanks for letting me share with my CCBA family!"
3568	September 19, 2019 5:40PM	Sandman6472	"Since I turn 65 come November 1st, deciding on what to do about Medicare. I’m a retired federal employee under civil service, so we have a federal backed health plan. It’s a “ secondary insurance” not a “supplemental insurance” as there is a difference from what I’ve been told. Since I’m already getting social security, another crazy story, I’m already signed up for Part A & Part B.
I only get $100/month for my s s due to the Windfall Provision Act Reagan passed, which basically says I can’t get my full s s due to my getting a government pension. If I keep both Part A & Part B, it’ll cost me an additional $135/month payment plus the $245/month I pay for our secondary. But the $30 co-pay I give to my pain doc every 3 months will be taken care of by both. Since that’s my only outlay besides the $10 co-pay for my two medications every month, thinking keeping Part B isn’t worth it. I’m relatively healthy and my gall bladder surgery and allergy surgery these last 12 months were the only things I’ve had in like 35 years.
Spoke with a few others I used to work with and they also only kept Part A plus their secondary insurance. Have done the math and better to just keep Part A if I think the next few years will be healthy ones. And that’s my dilemma here, what should I do?? Since my wife is a year younger that I, she doesn’t know what I should do.
So, anyone here in a similar situation, please give me a holler in here and maybe we can compare notes. My cards were sent back since they had the wrong street address for us, government...go figure!! So, sending me new cards and a form to get out of Part B if I decide to go that route. The lady I spoke with at Medicare was very smart and logical and made me see things both ways. But still, not sure which fork in the road to take right now. Is having more money each month the better option than losing all my s s plus paying out an additional $35/month? I just don’t know????"
3569	September 19, 2019 5:41PM	kyfdx	@breld Nice!

Not sure I could do snow again, but do know one thing, I can’t do anymore hurricanes either. Doubt my family would ever consent to moving out west but I’d sure like to give it a try.
Looks absolutely breath taking with all those mountains. And I wouldn’t mind some “cooler” weather to be honest. Moderation is the key."

Sounds like using a broker might be the way to go next time next year when my mom has to look the thing is getting her test drive stuff very important still so then Luis can have a broker get the white car she wants even maybe my dad next year to supposedly he’s going to get rid of his car and do something with me to lease or buy used I don’t know. But to try out soon or definitely in order. I keep mentioning it to him ha ha Ha and I mentioned to my mom to I’m only looking for the next car no more Nissan get something different.
3575	September 19, 2019 6:01PM	marcogallo1986	Even mentioned to the neighbors about going to a broker but they haven’t test drive anything in their lease is up October 15 and was in a month I give up it’s on them and every time I try to talk to them about it they change the subject especially the arrogant husband he’s an arrogant Indian guy starting to sound racist but just the way he personally is. He’s nice to me and all but very frustrating it’s like his way or the highway one of those people take me seriously oh well it is what it is. You’re probably gonna go with another boring see RV again oh well. They’re not car people so I guess that’s fine ha ha Ha.

3577	September 19, 2019 6:03PM	pensfan83	Nice @breld!
3578	September 19, 2019 6:06PM	marcogallo1986	@ he JC, glad the campground is coming along and you just got it two weeks ago. If you’re interested my cousin is selling his 2005 Ford Crown Victoria I think he’s asking $3000 has 68,000 miles I believe, he’s had it over three years. One is good, just want the tires soon. He has two empowers also that you got it auction will be for sale in the coming weeks. Then I went with him last week to pick up.
3579	September 19, 2019 6:10PM	nyccarguy	@breld - Wow! It is beautiful. I LOVE the 3rd garage separate from the 2 car. Are those stones on both sides of the driveway for aesthetics or do they aid in drainage?
3580	September 19, 2019 6:14PM	pensfan83	You aren't far off @marcogallo1986 ! With his Tacoma already being pressed into hauling duty motion to change @nyccarguy's handle to @nyccargoguy
3581	September 19, 2019 6:35PM	laurasdada	New Hampster is on my list, beautiful mountains and lakes. Not as onerous financially for retirees as Vermont (my first true love). Plus, I dig snow! Not as much as I used to, but it wouldn't be a deterrent.
3582	September 19, 2019 6:35PM	xwesx	Maintenance is one area that does cost more, miles be darned, for more cars. However, it might not in this case when you consider all costs. Obviously, lease maintenance is minimal, but it takes a lot of Mopar maintenance to add up to a little BMW maintenance.
3583	September 19, 2019 6:38PM	xwesx	*raises hand* Same vehicle? I haven't made it yet in terms of putting all those miles on from our household, but that's because other drivers out there simply refuse to behave themselves.
3584	September 19, 2019 6:38PM	stickguy	When you DIY it makes the $ hit less of a problem. Plus, if an old car breaks, you really want a spare so not left hanging.
3585	September 19, 2019 6:44PM	xwesx	Looks nice. Perhaps you'll be there long enough to watch it mature a bit.
3586	September 19, 2019 6:50PM	ab348	So far, he doesn't swap houses at the same rate at which he swaps cars, so he's got that going for him, at least.
3587	September 19, 2019 6:57PM	pensfan83	Speaking of old cars and maintenance the intermittent failure of the power windows/locks/mirrors on the drivers door of the Prelude was traced to a pinched wire, as I originally suspected. However when putting things back together the shop found the wires were brittle enough that they noted it would be only a matter of time until things broke down again. Instead of taking my chances with harnesses from a pull-a-part yard the shop is going to rewire the harnesses in both doors with new wiring. Will be about $250 for parts/labor.
3588	September 19, 2019 7:18PM	qbrozen	"nice @breld. My wife would never be able to handle that single-car garage entry/exit without hitting something.

So am I right in assuming the 2-car has an entry from within the house, while the single-car has an entry from the covered porch?"
3589	September 19, 2019 7:21PM	qbrozen	@stickguy. I think you jinxed my car. The touchscreen for the uconnect works about 20% of the time, and the BT doesn't work. Connects to the head unit, but I can't hear the caller and they can't seem to hear me. Dangit.
3590	September 19, 2019 7:24PM	stickguy	"Dump it. Time to move on.

Plus it’s an 11 YO car that was traded in for some reason!"
3591	September 19, 2019 7:42PM	qbrozen	Oh, you don't even want to know all the things needing doing on the Equinox. And I'm discovering that someone has already rooted around trying to fix things and evidently gave up. LOL.
3592	September 19, 2019 7:45PM	stickguy	"Hope you needed a hobby.

This is a big part of why I gave up on trying to get an affordable used car. Rare to find, and good deals get snapped up, with the rest having “stories”. And I’m not good enough to figure them our before hand, or fix most afterwards."
3593	September 19, 2019 7:46PM	28firefighter	And with super cheap leases...why take the gamble? Unless you're @qbrozen and can and like to wrench your own cars.
3594	September 19, 2019 7:53PM	stickguy	I also have no stomach for trying to private sale older cars. Or any cars. That ship has sailed. Next car will be a buy (no or loaner) for the wife, and if I flip the RDX it will be for something no more than 2YO most likely. Then just hang on, unless it’s another cheap lease.
3595	September 19, 2019 8:12PM	ab348	Time to re-aquaint yourself with the friendly proprietors of your local junqueyards.
3596	September 19, 2019 8:32PM	xwesx	That's the best way to do it, though. If you're going to go through the trouble of the process, might as well get the best benefit!
3597	September 19, 2019 8:35PM	xwesx	@qbrozen - A new head unit is likely the best way to go on that one. Least headache and you know what you're getting. Just don't go too far overboard by adding amps and new cones, and it shouldn't be too terrible of a project nor too expensive.
3598	September 19, 2019 8:41PM	stickguy	I expect to see soon pictures of a Daytona dashboard completely dissembled.

3600	September 19, 2019 9:06PM	Michaell	"The pictures @breld posted of the new house do not do it justice. I had a chance to tour it when it was fairly empty.

Huge! Both the house and the lot.

And, I'm not ashamed to take credit for the idea to park the Audi in the 1 car garage - he was going to put the GTI in there, but I convinced him that the two VWs in the ""big"" garage would mean more room for other stuff.

The basement is full size, and contains what Mrs. @breld calls the ""JonBenet"" room - quite the macabre reference, but the name fits the space, for sure.

The main basement space is large enough for a batting cage - something @breld and I talked about during the tour, what with both of his boys involved in baseball."

3603	September 19, 2019 11:06PM	qbrozen	"Ordered a head unit and backup cam for $150. Coming from China. Haha. Found through an article I found when I googled “cheapest carplay stereo.”

The Chevy had 3 warnings when I bought it: service TPMS, service power steering, and service stabilitrak. The TPMS I sorted rather quickly. The tires are fairly new, so I surmised they just didn’t know or didn’t bother relearning the sensors. Went through the motions and problem solved. The others are eluding me thus far. I have pulled 3 codes and all are regarding lack of signal from the BCM, so they are most certainly related, and everything I have read points to a break in a wire somewhere. There have been several TSBs all for this very thing. I have checked 4 of 5 likely culprits so far (2 under the carpet and 2 under the hood) and found no fault. The last is done under the car and I just haven’t had the time yet.

The car still drives perfectly fine. The messages are nothing more than a minor irritation at startup."
3604	September 19, 2019 11:22PM	corvette	I'd check the model specific boards to see whether it's a known issue or if a firmware update is available. Edit: never mind, I see you're going to replace the head unit. Let us know how it goes!

And you’re exactly right on the entrances to and from the garages. It’d be nice to have all 3 spaces be directly accessible from the house, but the “separate” 3rd car garage is fun in its own right ...and more than I had at the last house."

After spending a little time with it, I have to say I am extremely pleased with the condition. This is a super clean example. The only standout cosmetic issues are the color difference between the plastic bumpers and body that always come with time and the hazy light lenses. The latter I will be addressing with the $115 worth of replacements I just ordered off ebay. The former is just a fact of using differing materials for a body. It is what it is. I’d be afraid to try to get it corrected.

Oh, a puc of underhood. Could eat a meal off this thing.

I even called in and the staff said that they didn't have any additional information. It turns out that he just had a tremendous amount of dense scar tissue that they had to carefully go through. He is in the ICU, but he was extubated today. It seems that things are just going slowly, although he might have suffered a kidney injury somewhere along the line. We are still wait and see on that.

For the current house, we do have a stone fascia that they had to cut through. That seemed pretty routine for them, and they did do a great job.

2017 BMW X3 - value $30K+ is now $120/yr cheaper to insure than my 2006 BMW that is worth maybe $6K."
3637	September 20, 2019 6:59PM	28firefighter	I'm sure it has something to do with the average history of someone driving a 2006 BMW 330 now (probably late teens and early 20-somethings).
3638	September 20, 2019 7:03PM	kyfdx	Is it my new 9-2X?
3639	September 20, 2019 7:03PM	Michaell	"Speaking of insurance, I've been in pretty regular contact with my agent regarding insurance for the new business.

Since the Jetta went back, we ""suspended"" the insurance for 6 months, so the multi-car discount still applies to the Outback.

But, the franchise we hitched our wagon to requires us to maintain $500K of insurance on the vehicles, so there will be a small bump in the premium for that (was $300K previously).

Seems silly, since the business is conducted in a specific location; not sure why our cars need to have higher coverage.

Whatever. It's just money.

Which is finally starting to come in, now that we've opened the doors."
3640	September 20, 2019 7:05PM	kyfdx	When my son started to drive, I moved our limits up to 250/500/100 vs. getting an umbrella liability policy. The cost was minimal.
3641	September 20, 2019 7:12PM	stickguy	Michael, been following your progress. Looks like a fun place. I could see us doing that when my daughter gets completely fed up with the corporate world!

3643	September 20, 2019 7:31PM	corvette	I have $1M combined single limits on the cars and $1M UM/UIM. It's not cheap. Also have a $1M umbrella--that one is cheap.

I think my first experience with TS was when I test drove the 1998 Maxima 5 speed. nailed it coming up a curved on ramp to the highway, in 2nd or 3rd gear, and just about shot off into the woods. I learned to really hang on after that, and be a little more careful punching the throttle."
3647	September 20, 2019 9:05PM	Michaell	If I'm able to get back in the market, I'd like to have dibs on the GTI.
3648	September 20, 2019 9:15PM	Michaell	"Thanks! It's been a long road, for sure.We first made contact with these folks over a year ago, and we opened on Labor Day.

Everything has cost more and taken longer than expected, and we were getting inspections up until a few days before we opened. Learned an awful lot about commercial real estate, and how utterly different it is than closing on a house.

Fortunately, we ended up with a great general contractor (recommended by our architect). Only a couple of construction delays, but all of that is now behind us.

The marketing efforts seem to be working, and we just had our first word of mouth enrollment for classes today - it's a ""teacher in-service"" day for the school district, so the studio is hosting a full day camp.

Fingers crossed that we'll be earning enough money to cover all our expenses when we start having to pay rent in December (first two months are free, per the lease, and we already made the first lease payment along with the deposit when the lease was signed back in March)."
3649	September 20, 2019 9:17PM	Michaell	If you're curious, they are taking applications for new franchises. We've heard there is an interested party in PA, though I don't know where, exactly. New stores being planned for both TN and SC (base of operations is in NC, with something like 10 studios there).

3667	September 21, 2019 2:36PM	jpp75	I LOVE the power sliding rear window! Colorado's climate allows for many days where it's enjoyable to have the windows/sunroof open and the sliding rear window makes it that much better.

No sunroof in our truck."
3669	September 21, 2019 6:50PM	andres3	"The front right tired in the A4 was 27 psi, losing 11 psi in about 10-14 days. Definitely a problem as it's the 4th time the sensor has gone off for that tire, but the first time a significant ""no doubt"" amount of psi was lost.

It has been doing this since brand new, so I'm a bit afraid it might not be a nail or screw. Will see when a tire store is less busy.

I know punctures are not always a tires fault, but sometimes I can't help but think some tires are more puncture prone than others."
3670	September 21, 2019 7:26PM	fintail	Funny, last night I was out in the wagon, and I got a persistent tire pressure warning message - yet all pressures were within spec. I kept an eye on it, no issues. This morning it persisted, so I took it to the dealer. I was told to just reset it, I did so, and it went away. I'll chalk it up to German electronics
3671	September 21, 2019 7:43PM	corvette	My friend bought a new Kia Forte last year, and has had something like 4 flats since she owned it. Never had that many punctures before. She did enough research to figure out that the OEM tires on hers are extremely poorly rated and planned to just replace them, since she otherwise likes the car.

3687	September 22, 2019 12:49AM	cdnpinhead	My guess is that ambient temperatures are dropping enough that tire pressures that were marginal over the summer have crossed over the line. When I come up to the cabin, where the temperature is 30-50 degrees colder, during the first snappy weather in the fall, I get tire pressure warnings. Hasn't happened yet this year. Charles's law is not to be denied.
3688	September 22, 2019 1:04AM	stickguy	I love having the individual tire readouts. I scroll through the TC menu on a regular basis and check what all the tires are at. Both my cars have that.

3692	September 22, 2019 3:31AM	roadburner	Newer BMWs tell individual tire temperatures as well as air pressure. I'm going to try and code that feature on my 2er when I get a chance.
3693	September 22, 2019 3:37AM	fintail	My car does pressure and temperature too. No cold snaps yet, and we barely had a summer here. Today the high might be 70 with a low of 55 compared to a high of 75 and a low of 60. I drove another 50 miles today, no lights.
3694	September 22, 2019 3:41AM	Michaell	The right rear tire on the Outback was low yesterday. 29 PSI compared to 38 for the other three. No individual readouts, however.
3695	September 22, 2019 4:32AM	andres3	"Speaking of tires.... Yokohama has a new track/street tire, the ADVAN A052, kind of an oddball name/number, but whatever. I'd have to go down to 245/35R19's from my preferred 255/35/R19 square setup, but they seem to be the latest cat's meow. I wish they'd add 255's to their sizing lineup.

Then again, planning on making a half the mileage claim on the 4S's from Michelin, that I burned out in less than 15K miles, and they are warranted 30,000 miles. Michelin might prefer I go back to Sport Cup 2's..."
3696	September 22, 2019 9:50AM	tjc78	"They level it with pneumatic jacks and it’s sitting in concrete blocks. It’s actually really solid.

3697	September 22, 2019 9:54AM	tjc78	I’m surprised a Subaru dealer even kept that Grand Marquis. Pretty funny the stock photo is of a 95-97 but a 98 is for sale.
3698	September 22, 2019 11:09AM	ab348	It's never a good sign when they use a stock photo instead of pics of the actual car for sale.

that Subaru dealer for some reason often keeps older, cheaper cars like that. No idea why really. Their lot is actually really small, so not like tons of room to store them."
3700	September 22, 2019 12:43PM	benjaminh	What about an X1? Saw one of those on the road recently and I thought it looked sharp, kinda a like a slightly larger and taller BMW 3-series wagon.
3701	September 22, 2019 12:47PM	benjaminh	"Maybe you need an Acura TLX, which has tire pressure sensors on each tire. The day I took this pic it was kinda hot and I had just been on the highway, and so the pressures seem to be a little high....

This was when it was almost new. I now have over 19,000 miles on the car, which means I'm going over mileage so far on my 12k a year lease."
3702	September 22, 2019 12:52PM	stickguy	"I looked at an X1 last year and test drove it. I actually did not care for it as much as I thought I would. And for some reason BMW didn't offer some of the options I wanted. A little bit on the smaller side for us possibly also.

that was a case where I found the car online, got really excited, rushed up to see it figuring I would be nailing down a deal, and ended up not wanting it. Weird. also possible that if I had gotten it and got used to it, would have really liked it."
3703	September 22, 2019 12:54PM	benjaminh	Is the new RDX still out of ideal budget range?
3704	September 22, 2019 12:59PM	sda	The 06 Acura TL shows individual tire pressure, the newer Accord and surprisingly the Q5 do not. Go figure. I don’t drive it often, but every time I drive the TL I am impressed by how nice it drives and the high quality interior build.
3705	September 22, 2019 1:21PM	stickguy	probably until the TLX goes back. Problem with the RDX is that there are not loaner deals to be had, and not much viable slightly used inventory that saves enough to make it worthwhile. So it is new, without much of a discount. And so far the lease offers have not been great.
3706	September 22, 2019 1:38PM	qbrozen	Who said I'd be posting pics of a disassembled dash? I believe that was for the Charger's stereo, but here is a much more horrific sight for you to cringe at.

3711	September 22, 2019 4:13PM	stickguy	Marco, other stuff came up so we did not go out. Probably trying Wednesday night.
3712	September 22, 2019 4:18PM	stickguy	"Q, hopefully after all that you tracked down the problem. and got it all put back together! That is way beyond what I would ever try! And yes, that was me, but I was thinking about the Charger.

I need your skills, and willingness to dive in. The RDX's USB is flakey. sometimes it connects, sometimes it doesn't, and will cut in and out (basic loose connection). But it is old fashioned, in that instead of a jack, it has a couple wires coming out with a plug dangling from the end. No clue why they did it like that, and no idea where the problem is. Maybe it would take cutting off the end and connecting a new one to the wires. Not something I will do, and probably a fortune to have the dealer debug and fix. Sadly I did not see the problem before the BtoB warranty ran out.

I just don't use it. Cheap fix. BT connection only, and a 12v outlet plug for charging."
3713	September 22, 2019 5:26PM	marcogallo1986	@stick guy! Sounds good yes things to come up it is what it is but hopefully you guys are able to go Wednesday night.
3714	September 22, 2019 5:44PM	qbrozen	No fix on the equinox. BUT, after reassembly and rereading the codes, they changed. So I think MAYBE I have it narrowed down to a particular connector at the rear diff. My next step will be to removed that connector altogether and rewire it. It is 10-11 wires, so not horrible.
3715	September 22, 2019 6:08PM	ab348	Could also be where it connects at the other end behind the dash or in the console. I had something like that on my previous ATS. USB connector inside the console compartment fell into the nothingness between the compartment and the gear lever. I took that section of the console apart and found a missing retainer clip laying on the center tunnel. Replaced and all was well again.
3716	September 22, 2019 7:09PM	qbrozen	Agreed that best solution is pulling stereo and replacing whole wire.
3717	September 22, 2019 8:26PM	nyccarguy	
3718	September 22, 2019 8:34PM	stickguy	sad yet exciting. I was bummed that I did not find a great replacement when Carvana made such a generous offer on the RDX. would have been fun to have new car arrive on flatbed, and old one leave on it. I would feel like such a player!
3719	September 22, 2019 8:38PM	stickguy	"for the RDX? I need to look closer on how to get at it, but the USB comes out of the bottom of the cubby at the front of the console (right ahead of the shifter). I have no clue how many pieces have to be removed to get behind that. My guess is the whole center console. Maybe I will run out now and take a quick look since I am curious.

more likely, I live with it until I unload the car, since the other plausible option is paying to have it done. maybe I will ask the dealer next time it goes in for service how much to even check it out.

I really hate taking trim pieces off. they never seem to go back the way they came out."

I agree. Connectors, connectors equals problems, problems. I have yet to find a wire go bad between connectors unless it was pinched due to a poor routing design or poor routing due to incompetence or laziness. Wires just don't go bad.

3722	September 22, 2019 11:25PM	corvette	I think some of the older Volvos (or maybe it was another make) used biodegradable wiring... that kind, went bad.
3723	September 22, 2019 11:54PM	stickguy	thanks AB. I will take a look. I tried a couple different wires that I knew were good, and even bought a USB port tester. it sometimes connects by goes in and out, like if a plug was loose in an outlet.
3724	September 23, 2019 2:57AM	fintail	Many MBs from ~1992-96 had that issue in the wiring harness. You'll be out a good few grand to get it set right, but I guess the lucky thing is that most surviving cars so many years later have had the issue remedied.

3730	September 23, 2019 9:48AM	nyccarguy	"Part of being a Chronic Car Buyer is saying goodbye. As you all saw from yesterday’s pic, Carvana came by yesterday and picked up my (now former 2015 Infiniti Q40). I bought it with 7,468 miles and sold it with 55,200 miles.

The process itself was really easy. I’m amazed by technology. A few clicks of the mouse, enter in some information, click yes, pick out a pick up date, & a flat bed come to your house with a check in hand to haul your car away.

As long as the business model is sustainable then it seems like a good one. I was chatting with the driver who said he does pretty much an equal amount of pick ups and drop offs.

I got what I think is a good price ($13,245) for my car. In the letter I got from the dealer saying they “want my trade” and will get me into a “newer car with a full factory warranty at a lesser payment that gets better gas mileage,” that their offer is based on GALVES value of $11,025 for my car. I also checked a couple other websites that give an “instant offer,” but in the end Carvana gave the highest price.

@breld, It seems like you guys in CO ( @Michaell & @jpp75 ) have a lot of one price dealers where you seemingly stalk a vehicle until the price comes down to an acceptable level. Did Carvana have the best price on your current GTI or did they just have the Color/Mileage example that you were looking for?"
3731	September 23, 2019 10:10AM	nyccarguy	"The Tacoma did it’s thing yesterday. My son (who turns 13 today, BTW) had a hockey game in West Haven yesterday AM. A friend of his on the team needed a ride, so I took them both and just threw their hockey bags & sticks in the bed.

The game was ugly. Terrible kids on the other team coached by a not nice coach and being raised by bad parents. To tip my hat to them, they were a superior team as far as hockey skills go. They out skated us, out shot us, out stick handled us, and flat out were better than us. They scored their 1st (of 12 goals) 45 seconds into the game. They got 15 penalties during the game including 3 “2 & 10” penalties and 1 game misconduct where a player was ejected with less than 2 minutes to go in the game. The coach never told his players to “let off the gas” when they were clearly destroying us. The parents were cheering like they just won the Stanley Cup after goal #9 + in the 3rd period.

A nice 45 minute ride there, hit an awesome diner with my son for lunch afterwards and a quick 50 minute trip home. The Tacoma drives well on well maintained stretches of road. The adaptive cruise works fantastic."
3732	September 23, 2019 12:22PM	stickguy	"I just checked, and your car is not up yet. They do have 2 recent Q40 additions (last week they had none) listed as coming soon/reserve now. both with about 42K. One listed at $16,700 and the other at $18,200. So they likely are making money on yours.

odd that they are identical other than color (expensive one is black, cheaper silver). They even have a link to the original window sticker (I love that on a used car!) and they were exactly the same price. Wonder why? Hard to imagine color making that much difference.

Edit: NM, figured it out. the cheaper one is RWD, pricier is AWD. And I can't read because the RWD was $36K ad AWD $38 originally (I saw the 8 as a 6).

so deduct for the extra 13,000 miles and assume they list your for $17.500 and probably sell it quick with minimal investment."
3733	September 23, 2019 12:35PM	ab348	Is there any inspection involved, or pictures required? How do they differentiate among a meticulously cared-for creampuff, an average used car, and one that has been abused?
3734	September 23, 2019 12:53PM	stickguy	"they take your word for it, and run a carfax, when making the offer. But it is contingent on an inspection before they take the car. On mine, the girl did a basic walk around and took a bunch of pictures. If you look at one of their listings, there is usually a link to the inspection pictures. So as long as you did nor misrepresent the car, they give you the check.

Not sure what happens if they get there and find the interior trashed, and unexpected body damage. I assume they have to deal with the home office and revise the offer, but then the paperwork won't be right (nor the check they bring). So my guess is if you lied about the car, they go back without it.

mine was easier for them, since I took it to the retail location (vending machine) to drop it off."
3735	September 23, 2019 12:53PM	nyccarguy	"When i told them I wanted them to buy my car, I had to upload a picture of the odometer, the registration, my driver's license, & the payoff amount.

The guy came to pick up the car and he took a picture of the odometer, the VIN, and a couple of shots of the outside.

There are 3 choices for the car's condition. I was honest and picked the middle choice. They deducted $500 because I chose that option. I guess if you choose ""perfect"" and they get to your house and all 4 wheels are curbed, the body panels look like they've been used at the local gun range for target practice, and the windshield is shattered there would be an issue.

The driver explained to me that my car would be taken to their Westport, CT location, then transported with 9 or 10 other cars to another facility where they get repaired and reconditioned. My guess is they will mount & balance 4 new tires as well as replace the front brake pads & rotors, then give it a detail and throw it up for sale. The rear bumper could use a wet sand and re-spray. I'm curious to see what they advertise it for and how long it takes them to sell it."
3736	September 23, 2019 12:56PM	stickguy	my guess is $17,500, and not long! Even if they do those repairs and the detail, they still are only in on it for mid-14's, so $3k gross profit.
3737	September 23, 2019 3:13PM	jmonroe1	"About my Carvana experience:

When the guy showed up to get Mrs. j's near perfect 2012 Legacy Limited with the 3.6 engine which had just turned 36K miles, he had a reprinted check from Carvana ready to be given to me. That surprised me and I asked what if he felt the car was not in the condition as I described it? He said they would not give me the check and would have to arrange for a technician and / or a body guy to come out to look it over. That would start the process over again and that could take a week or two to happen.

FWIW, Carvana gave me $12,751 for it (the dealer dug in at ($10,500) and IIRC, they sold it for $16,200. And they sold it almost instantly when it was listed a little more than 2 weeks after they stole it from me.

EDIT: the check was preprinted not reprinted.

3738	September 23, 2019 3:54PM	pensfan83	"When I was looking for an Integra or Prelude last year I set my BaT account to screen for Hondas or Acuras and in the intervening months since closing on my purchase I've received various notifications of auctions. This one stuck out because it's the same year as mine, in a color combo I had at the top of the list, and has almost 160K less miles.....for substantially more than I paid for mine however. I guess the market is still strong for late 90's/early 2000's Honda/Acura models, makes me curious whether mine would fetch at least what I paid.

3741	September 23, 2019 4:56PM	pensfan83	I like it when paired with the tan interior, which was only available for the first 2 years of the 5th gen. Otherwise I like San Marino Red, Milano Red, or Electron Blue Pearl, which was only available in '01.
3742	September 23, 2019 4:56PM	stickguy	I like that color.
3743	September 23, 2019 4:58PM	nyccarguy	"When I was searching for Prelude leftovers back in 2002, I knew the pickings would be on the slim side since I wanted a stick. The dealer closest to my parent's house had (6) Automatics.

(1) Red Type SH or White Type SH
(2) Black Type SH
(3) Electron Blue Pearl Type SH
(4) Red Base or White Base
(5) Black Base
(6) Green Type SH (I think they changed the color green & it came with the black interior, so it was palatable)
(7) Silver Type SH or Silver Base"
3744	September 23, 2019 5:05PM	pensfan83	Red was not a the top of my list given the well known fading issues of Hondas of that period. However this one came with a full, well done respray so I relented.
3745	September 23, 2019 5:18PM	tjc78	"I like the Prelude in red. It just works on that car.

The dark green is period especially with the beige interior. I prefer Honda’s dark green to what Chrysler or Ford had at the time."

I am sure it would rustle some people somewhere, but hockey parents can be the worst.

Okay, maybe that's a really bad idea."
3749	September 23, 2019 6:03PM	breld	"This GTI purchase definitely was more driven by the particular vehicle - SE w/plaid and manual in a good color. But the price was indeed comparable to local listings, if not better. As it turned out, the Carvana delivery experience was positive. I think the hardest part was deciding to purchase the vehicle and having to wait a couple weeks for delivery - I'm more used to immediate gratification!

One frustrating thing with Carvana was the registration process - I opted for the self-registration option and to transfer my existing plates from the Miata to the GTI. I even followed up to make sure all that was in process and I was assured I would be receiving in the mail the registration documents and a check to refund the registration fees charged. Then last week I get a FedEx with new plates. I followed up with them knowing there wasn't anything to do about it - they apologized and acknowledged that there were all kinds of notes on the account to do it as a self-registration, but they were just ignored."
3750	September 23, 2019 6:04PM	breld	"That game experience is horrible - I've certainly experienced various levels of that sort of behavior in my kids' sports.

But nice on the Tacoma - again, I kinda want one."
3751	September 23, 2019 6:06PM	breld	Really? I happen to like that color - almost a signature color for that era of Prelude, IMO.
3752	September 23, 2019 6:17PM	nyccarguy	It was the Green with the Ivory Interior (I know most, if not all of you detest black guts) that I just couldn't stomach.
3753	September 23, 2019 6:22PM	nyccarguy	Don't go trading in your GTI on one just yet. It drives nicely for what it is, an old school, body on frame, truck. I like it a lot so far. I got into our Pilot on Saturday and it felt like a sports car. This morning I got into my Dad's Yukon to park it and it felt Lexus smooth.
3754	September 23, 2019 6:29PM	xwesx	Hah! Yes you did!
3755	September 23, 2019 6:30PM	xwesx	Huh. That's a neat looking little abode. Looks like it took a little damage on the front eaves there, and that trailer is perhaps maxed out! The flex that shows through the whole mid section of the right side makes me think it is sitting on permafrost here in Alaska.
3756	September 23, 2019 6:40PM	pensfan83	I wouldn't say I detest black interiors, I just really like how that combo looks as well as its notoriety in the Prelude community. I literally pored through hundreds of listings last year and can count on one hand the green/ivory combinations with only two in a condition that was acceptable. One unfortunately was on the west coast and there was one in North Carolina that popped up but the dealer botched things.
3757	September 23, 2019 6:40PM	fintail	"Were your kids playing a team at a similar level? Some parents need to understand the game can be solely about fun, and not just a means (often used by parents who can already afford a college fund) to eke out a scholarship often at some distant unknown school by playing a game - that seems to be the focus here nowadays, scholarships, and parents with unreasonable ambitions. I don't recall it being as insane when I was a kid.

I am involved with adult rec hockey, and there are some of ""those guys"" too, probably the same shouty dads on Sunday mornings are out at night overdoing it against other washed up old men like myself who just want to skate and play around. Note to middle aged blowhards - there are no scouts in the stands, your parents don't care, and may someone have mercy on you when you injure someone.

Going to from a car to that somewhat industrial Toyota pickup might be like going from the Escalade to my E wagon. Talk about different worlds."
3758	September 23, 2019 6:40PM	xwesx	Nice work! Where did you get the bar? I consider doing that a time or two with my Q7, just because that sculpted front end just looks so vulnerable without it. From a practical perspective... useless... but it just makes my mind feel more at ease. LOL
3759	September 23, 2019 6:50PM	jmonroe1	"It says, ""31k Indicated Miles"". So, since it's a 1999, it more than likely has real miles like the one you bought. However, it does look good for its age.

It is funny, my son's coach from last year was proabably 2-3 injuries to NHL players from making it pro. The guy is so humble and such a gentleman. He plays in the men's league at (people tell me) at 1/2 speed. Every once in a while someone REALLY ticks him off and he opens up, watch out. His kid was on Andre's team last year and you'd never know he was the coach's son. There's not too many like that out there."

I kept the Elantra plates when I got the TLX, since you can’t transfer them onto a lease. I think that registration was 3 years, and I don’t get a refund. So, in case I buy a spare car, I got spare plates!"
3765	September 23, 2019 8:13PM	28firefighter	Here in WA, registration and RTA costs travel with the car but the plates travel with the owner. The cost of new plates is so minuscule that unless you're emotionally attached, it makes no sense to transfer them. Looking at the paperwork now, the registration on the new fleet addition is going to be around $800(!).
3766	September 23, 2019 8:26PM	breld	"Oh the GTI would stay.

It's the A5 that will get replaced at some point for something with more utility."
3767	September 23, 2019 8:42PM	pensfan83	I've had the same specialty plate since 2004 or 2005 I think and the registration follows the plate, just need to pay a transfer fee when I've moved it from vehicle to vehicle; it's currently on the Acura. The rest of the cars have regular plates. Registration is $96/year since on the truck since it's a Class II pickup, same as my father's full size F-150 which is odd. I can't complain too much though, for 4 cars registration totals $225/year. I am going to lose about 8.5 months of registration on the Nissan since it was renewed in June and the plate isn't being transferred to another vehicle.
3768	September 23, 2019 8:50PM	Michaell	"In CO, plates stay with the owner, not the car.

Outback and MINI both have specialty plates - I think the plates on the Outback have been on 2 or 3 other cars before it, and the MINI plates were on the daughter's first MINI, as well."

3770	September 23, 2019 9:26PM	fintail	"Sounds like whoever organizes games in that league needs to work on parity. Just as one wouldn't set up a match between an ECHL team and a reigning SC champion. That kind of stuff can be discouraging for kids. I've seen it in adult leagues too, when a team keeps losing 15-3 and nothing is balanced, eventually the league loses players.

I skate with a guy, roughly my age, who played high level junior hockey where he captained a league championship, got a 4 year NCAA ticket, and then played minor pro. He now coaches and provides instruction full time, which must be a job where you actually look forward to it. He's the most fun and encouraging guy I have met on the ice - kids love him, and adults go for it, too. He just gets working with people, and can make it fun while providing firm instruction and encouragement. I've taken a couple adult tactical classes led by him, which are some of the most fun I've had since I was a kid. He's why the game succeeds and spreads, not via the blowhards who don't have 1/10th the skill and 1/100th the personality."
3771	September 23, 2019 10:48PM	28firefighter	In case anyone needs a product endorsement. Wife decided to wear a brand new pair of jeans (not pre-washed) in our Outback today. Then called me panicked that her ivory seats had turned blue. Turtle Wax Leather Cleaner took it right off with one light pass. My white towel is now blue, of course. I think we got lucky - if it were warmer and/or she didn't notice, it probably would have set and this would have been a far more difficult exercise.
3772	September 23, 2019 10:55PM	suydam	This is why I don’t like ivory seats. The Volt’s are a coffee brown trimmed in black (called cognac for some reason, the Encore’s are medium grey, and neither show anything. Some leathers are worse than others at absorbing blue jean transfer too.

3789	September 24, 2019 4:25AM	andres3	"So I got the TTS back today. Wasn't as long as I thought to get the rear shock assembly installed.

WOW! What a difference! It's amazing how you don't notice how old you've gotten since you see yourself in the mirror every day, but when you see a picture from 10 years ago, you might notice some differences. Well, I noticed some differences. The old shocks must of had very little resistance left.

The rear feels like it's sitting on a cushioned cloud perched up over the road. Bumps get soaked up and smoothed out. I haven't tested dynamic mode yet, but it felt like it was handling much better and not getting the least bit squirrely (or noisy) where it used to be clunky by comparison. Handling seems MUCH improved even in comfort mode.

Perfect timing as I plan to do 3 track days in November at Buttonwillow, CA. I will have to do a spirited drive this weekend to end the 4S tires life once and for all.

Speaking of new shocks, doesn't this mean I should probably realign the vehicle?

Lastly... I'm remember the rear tires getting way looser on the drag strip than necessary with sticky 255 Michelin 4S's. I have a feeling these new shocks will cut my 1/8th mile time by at least a tenth or two."
3790	September 24, 2019 4:39AM	andres3	Big fast and heavy can very very fun. The part you get tired of is your wallet being drained if you actually drive it fast rather than just make it look like it's fast.
3791	September 24, 2019 11:56AM	qbrozen	The Charger is definitely fun. I understand what RB means, though, as that was me with the G35X. However, I consider this very different because it is large and comfortable and sounds amazing. The G gave no benefit with that extra poundage. The Charger is something I could easily be comfy all day in, have room for the whole family to stretch out, and leave rubber stripes wherever I go.

3793	September 24, 2019 12:26PM	nyccarguy	"Did this just happen all of the sudden or has it been an ongoing problem. The ""feed valve"" most likely went bad. Pressure is constant, so most likely you have too much water (Volume) which is causing the constant banging. It looks like a camel hump. If it is a ""single hump"" valve, then it is your feed valve. A ""double hump"" valve is a feed valve with a pressure reducing valve."

3797	September 24, 2019 12:52PM	stickguy	speaking of plumbing, the princess finally got her shower fixed. This is the vintage 1959 house that had, I believe, the original tub fixtures. the 3 piece configuration, with individual cold/hot handles, and a center diverter for spout/shower. Sad looking gold, and leaking. Hard to find decent quality direct replacements, and she hated that set-up anyway, so I found from the plumbing supply by me that Moen made a trim kit to replace that with a center handle valve. Finally got installed yesterday, looks much much better. New fancy safety valve, and one handle. Basically just a normal unit, but the circle trim plate is more oval (and bigger) so it covers the old holes from the 2 extra handles. Smart idea actually. will at least tide them over until can actually gut and redo the bathroom, though now they have new shower valve, vanity, toilet, light and mirror, so the only thing not done is taking out the tired old tub and all the blue tile!
3798	September 24, 2019 1:03PM	corvette	Having lived with both types of shower valves, I much prefer the pressure balancing kind that don’t scald you when someone flushes a toilet or fills up a glass of water.

3801	September 24, 2019 1:32PM	corvette	Correct, @ab348 - I have forced air gas and an electric water heater. No expansion tank on the water heater, and I think there should probably be one.

By Matt Posky on September 23, 2019

....Officially, Dahn’s team said it could not share the recipe but noted there was nothing secret about the ingredients. The battery pack in question is essentially your standard lithium-ion unit — just optimized for longevity, thanks to its particular chemistry and some massaging of the nanostructure of the battery’s cathode. Units in the paper used a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide and artificial graphite.

Tesla and Dahn were also recently awarded a patent on a single-crystal lithium-ion battery almost identical to the cells described in the research paper. While there’s no guarantee that the patented battery is the million-mile pack from the document, it includes an electrolyte additive called “ODTO” that the patent claims enhances the performance and lifespan of Li-ion batteries while reducing cost.""

3804	September 24, 2019 3:54PM	ab348	That is the exact setup I have. No expansion tank on my water heater, just the typical pressure relief valve. I just replaced the water heater last week after 13 years of service. Good timing, as it was ready to let go which was only apparent once the plumber disconnected everything and moved it to where it could be inspected better.
3805	September 24, 2019 10:08PM	xwesx	Nice color, six speed. Yeah, okay. I'm in.
3806	September 24, 2019 10:10PM	xwesx	you need an arrestor on it. Your system probably has one (or more) already, but it may have failed. Find and replace, or just add another. Pretty easy fix.
3807	September 24, 2019 10:18PM	andres3	"LOL! Rally racing group B J/k

Apparently there was a TSB on rear shocks of the TT's made in Hungary. Who knew? The fronts are fine, and the whole engineering of the car has come together to work in tandem the way it's supposed to. Amazing how much of a difference it made."

Maybe 2021 will have some good stuff! 2020, Acura did nothing, so I am guessing that 2021 will have a new MDX, and some sort of replacement for the ILX."
3809	September 24, 2019 10:32PM	xwesx	Oh yes. I forget that most people have city water. LOL
3810	September 24, 2019 10:44PM	corvette	I don’t think there is one. I’m not even sure there’s a pressure regulator. I don’t think an expansion tank is required (or needed) on the water heater - it looks like my municipality doesn’t use backflow preventers in residential applications. But, the problem is gone today. If it happens again while I’m sleeping, I’ll probably cut off the water supply until the next day.
3811	September 25, 2019 12:47AM	nyccarguy	"A few more “glad I got the pickup truck” moments coming up:

Wife: “Can you bring home toilet paper tomorrow?”

Me: “Gladly! I’ll bring home the entire case.”

I have toilet paper in a case with 96 rolls. The whole case didn’t fit in my Infiniti, so I would either have to bring home 1/2 a case or make arrangements to take the Pilot. Problem solved. Tacoma 1 - Wife 0

This Saturday evening, my (now) 13 year old has an away game about an hour away. 2 parents asked if I could give their son a ride. 4 people, 3 hockey bags, & 5 or 6 hockey sticks (some kids have 2). Problem solved. Tacoma 1 - Travel Hockey 0."
3812	September 25, 2019 12:52AM	kyfdx	Most likely, your pressure reducing valve has failed. Which would explain the sudden change.
3813	September 25, 2019 2:40AM	corvette	Thanks for your help... I'm assuming those are commonly located in the meter box? Because it's definitely not inside the house (water line enters the house in the crawlspace part of the half basement). Weirdly, the problem disappeared this morning, and came back again about 9:45 at night, so it would correspond with an outdoor temperature related issue. I closed off the shut off valve inside the house and purged off the line pressure, and I can still hear the banging sound near where the water line enters the house, although it's very faint. At least I'll be able to sleep tonight!
3814	September 25, 2019 9:52AM	qbrozen	You should offer up your story to Toyota marketing. Dune running, towing horse trailers, Having cinderblocks dumped into the bed from 10 feet up .... those aren’t what trucks are for. A case if TP and a few duffel bags. THAT’s what the engineers had in mind and what the consumers will get excited about. ;b
3815	September 25, 2019 9:57AM	nyccarguy	Yesterday marked 1 week of ownership (leasorship?). I fill up for the 2nd time. They burned through about 3/4 tank driving from Haverhill, MA to the DMV in Norwalk, CT. Their highway run plus my couple days commuting got a solid 20 mpg. Yesterday I calculated 18.5 mpg on my 1st full tank.
3816	September 25, 2019 10:42AM	pensfan83	Hahahaha, so true. I'll echo what @nyccarguy is saying though, it's incredibly nice to just throw baseball bags, dirty cleats, bases, etc. in the bed. I don't have to play Tetris at Costco anymore or have a kid hold the TP in their lap either
3817	September 25, 2019 11:28AM	kyfdx	Usually, on the water line, just inside the house.
3818	September 25, 2019 11:56AM	ab348	That makes me believe even an addition of a valve might not make the noise go away. Sounds like the problem is with the water utility. I would talk to them first.
3819	September 25, 2019 11:58AM	ab348	My financial training immediately made me start to try to figure out the business case for the purchase of a new pickup in order to facilitate the purchase of a 96-roll case of TP. I couldn't make the savings from buying TP in bulk offset the payments.

3824	September 25, 2019 1:50PM	pensfan83	Definitely not an issue with that here. Trucks and SUVs abound, I think we were one of the few households in the neighborhood that had 2 sedans as their primary vehicles.

3850	September 25, 2019 7:47PM	ab348	"After the GM bankruptcy we are down to 2 GM dealers in town (used to be 4). The place I got my last 3 cars from is owned by one of the 2 large dealer groups here, while the other one owns the other GM store. While I am not particularly in love with my dealer, the other group has an absolutely terrible reputation - the whole gamut of sleazy high pressure sales tactics, poor service departments, and just generally taking advantage of people. There was a recent string of tweets from a former salesguy at their Hyundai store outlining some of the things they did with people upside-down on their car that just made their situation worse, which didn't surprise me much.

I only ever dealt with them once, years ago, in 2011 when I had my '09 Lacrosse. When the selling dealer closed, I took it there for service a couple of times because it was close by. They had just purchased the dealership then and all of the former owner's staff were still there, including the veteran sales guy I bought my Intrigue from in '03 when he was at the other GM dealer here that also eventually closed. Now those people are virtually all gone.

Imagine my surprise this week when I start getting emails from them. An unknown-to-me saleslady first sends me an email saying:

""Good morning, I was talking with xxxx yyyyy, our General Sales Manager, while looking at your file, and it seems like we could potentially save you some money…""

Well, they don't have a file. I am currently on my 3rd vehicle after the one that I had there for service years ago. So this set off the BS meter.

It goes on:

""I had Jenny record a personal video for you:
www.SteeleGMCanadaWideClearance.com/we-want-your-vehicle

It’s only a minute and will explain everything…

You will also get instant access to up to $15,500 in
bonus offers if you let us make you an offer for your
current vehicle. Call me if you have any questions.

Call me if you have any questions.""

(Yes, that line was there twice)

A personal video - yeah, sure. But it explained much. First, they pivot from having a vehicle for me on file, to not knowing what it is, then back to having buyers interested in my mystery vehicle. Quite the trick. None of this is making me want to trust them very much. I also was not really surprised to find that ""Jenny"" is not on their staff at all according to their website. Really quite sleazy.

Today I got another one:

""Good afternoon, I’m writing this email with a bit of urgency because for the first time EVER, we have 25% OFF the MSRP on some of our models…

…that’s 1/4 OFF the price (CRAZY!!!)

Watch this now so you can be the first to act:
www.SteeleGMCanadaWideClearance.com/up-to-25-off-msrp

…I thought you might appreciate the extra cash!!!""

Guess what? Melinda and Mike don't work there either.

I was going to hit the unsubscribe button, but I think I will stick around for a while to see what else they hit me with. It is a bit discouraging because I now know for sure they are not a place I ever want to deal with, but good to know I suppose."
3851	September 25, 2019 7:53PM	xwesx	"I doubt there is neither on a municipal system, but maybe. Maybe something just worked lose (a tie down for a pipe somewhere) due to the torque of the water hammer effect over the years.

Whether an arrester is there now or not, you can certainly add them as needed. For a retrofit, I would use ""SharkBite"" type fittings just for the ease and speed of installation:"
3852	September 25, 2019 7:56PM	xwesx	Sounds like you're narrowing it down. Did you notice any change in pressure? Such as stronger flow from shower, etc.? If it is a pressure problem, you don't want to let it fester. Things may seem okay now, but it may be straining weak points in the system.
3853	September 25, 2019 8:06PM	fintail	The braintrust behind that nonsense - I see similar from dealers out here, I think many of them employ these marketing firms, giving a similar sleazy vibe from coast to coast.
3854	September 25, 2019 8:10PM	corvette	Yes, even with the old decrepit gate valve supposedly turning “off” water supply to the entire house, it was still letting some water through.

Very fancy building, and those subtle snob cues like overdressed salespeople. Even though I drove up in a nice car, am certainly old enough to be there, and can afford what I was sitting in!

did not end up driving or getting my coupon validated. Might stop back later in the week. To my shock, it was somewhat busy and the few sales people there that late were with someone. So I sat in an XT5 (very nice, but felt too big) and an XT4 (also really nice, and a nice tidy size). Thankfully they had one on the showroom floor hooked up to power. Plus it was a real base car (FWD, zero options, MSRP ~$35K) but it was still a nice interior and decently equipped. More cargo space and rear seat space than I expected. I am interested now in driving one, though to get one with the options I would want MSRP is more in the $46K range. And might require black interior.

pretty good looking in person. So will keep it on the list.

Will probably still look at one, but I think the XC60 will come off. Depends on how excited the wife is to look at it, but unless we decide to do a 3 year and dump lease, not thinking it is a good 10 year keeper for us."

3869	September 26, 2019 3:45AM	28firefighter	The issue with that Boxster is that the failure rate on the IMS bearing is much lower than 1999-2004 models, but is not nearly as serviceable - actually not at all, I don’t think.
3870	September 26, 2019 10:23AM	tjc78	Both of those are the same color combo as our Enclave. I love it.
3871	September 26, 2019 10:35AM	ab348	Pretty much the same color combo as my ATS too, though Porsche does/did take much more of a monochrome approach to the interior color, while GM mixes in a lot of black. On my ATS there is even more black than on the Corvette shown, which is unfortunate but typical of most manufacturers of late. Mine could have used a few Kona brown accents on the dash like the Vette..

3877	September 26, 2019 2:28PM	andres3	"So it turns out leasing is a scam industry, at least at Kia. They are trying to delibrately steal $350 dollars from me by putting it on the final bill added to the disposition fee. It is for a 2nd key FOB. The same 2 key FOB's the dealership receiveed when I returned the car.

For the pre-inspection, they don't tell you to bring both keys. So they note a missing Key FOB. Apparently though, the dealership specifically enters the number of KEY FOB's they received, so they continue the scam by noting 1 instead of 2.

Now I'm supposed to waste time out of my life to tell the dealership to correct their error and send Kia Finance a letter via email or fax that they did get 2 Key FOB's ????? WOW! Just WOW! Total fraud and dishonesty at Kia!

What a scam!

We'll see how the call to the dealership goes a bit later this morning PST.

Never again! NEVER! I've rented apartments before, I know how this scam works. Only there, they steal your deposit... thankfully, the only thing they can dishonestly and fraudulently attack is my credit score here. They will never see a penny of that $350."
3878	September 26, 2019 2:40PM	tjc78	Wow that sucks ... the woman on the phone with the inspection company explicitly told me to bring both key fobs to the inspection along with manuals and any accessories that need to go back with the car.
3879	September 26, 2019 3:09PM	stickguy	"They do. I’m sure it was in all the stuff they sent in advance. I got a lot of it from HMF related to the turn in process. Very detailed.

Dealer should have been more careful though, but they don’t pay much attention. Should be an easy fix, especially since there will, in fact, be 2 fobs with the car."
3880	September 26, 2019 3:55PM	andres3	"I think I read every word I got from Kia Finance, and I don't remember 2 key fob's being pointed out for the pre-inspection.

Regardless, my first call to the dealership resulted in ""may I take your name and number"" to see who this should go to. Hopefully, they didn't magically ""lose"" the 2nd Key FOB, or I might find it being sold on E-Bay."
3881	September 26, 2019 4:23PM	tjc78	I was told by the agent from the inspection service, not from Hyundai directly.
3882	September 26, 2019 5:13PM	Michaell	"When I had the inspection on the Jetta, the inspector asked to see both fobs, so he could check that off his list.

I also had a decent sized ding in the front passenger door that was waived."
3883	September 26, 2019 5:53PM	andres3	"As I suspected, the 2nd key fob is on craigslist or ebay, or already sold. The dealership says they received 1, both on their ""paper"" and on their ""photo"" they send to Kia Finance. Funny, how come I don't get the paper nor the photo when I return the vehicle. In the interest of full disclosure, they should probably share this with the customer.

I was sent packing with no paper. If the Kia was stolen and they claimed I never returned the car, I have photo documentation showing it in their parking lot the date I returned it. That's all I have. Apparently the dealership should have given me a ""receipt paper"" but I didn't even get that. I didn't think to photo document the two key FOB's, as they made it seem like lease returns were quick, easy and routine.

Finance and dealership pointing fingers at each other instead of resolving it. I'm not getting in the middle. I'll tell them to pound sand and figure it out amongst themselves."
3884	September 26, 2019 8:05PM	Sandman6472	"Fixed my password here again, why does this same issue always happen and why can't Edmunds get software that works? A shame that such a big company has Mickey Mouse software, honestly.
At work, drove a 2019 Rav4 yesterday and even though it was an LE model, it was very nice and handled very well. No Sat radio but the Apple Car Play worked flawlessly and now that the Apple tech walked me through getting the rest of my iTunes library on my phone, it's so much better and now have almost 900 songs to listen to. For an LE, the fabric on the seats was very grippy and something I could live with if I had to. There were soft plastics where they needed to be and the harder ones were tastefully done. Ergonomics were first rate and acceleration was about perfect and never felt under powered. Had driven an RR Evoque earlier in the day and though nice, I'd rather have a Rav4 to be honest as the controls were so much easier to use. It was an easier vehicle to drive also.
Still getting 2019 models in but suspect that the 2020's will be showing up soon. We're bringing a lot of turn back's and wholesales down to Miami for them to be sent on their way. Looks like I'm staying at my old office for the time being and working at the new one on Saturday's from 9 to noon, which has been my choice. Did miss a road trip to Ft. Myers on Tuesday as I had the driveway re-done plus a new kitchen faucet installed while the wife and daughter #2 were up in the mountains in Helen Georgia on a short vacation. I wasn't invited, so I had these few things taken care of with just the side pathway left to do for this years honey-do list."
3885	September 26, 2019 8:46PM	mjfloyd1	Did you take a picture of the two keyfobs?
3886	September 26, 2019 8:51PM	28firefighter	Somehow, I don't think this is a conspiracy for the dealer or KMF to screw with you. Annoying and bad customer service, but whenever I do lease returns I make sure they give me a written receipt of some kind indicating that the car was grounded, the condition (and I take pictures all around), and all the accessories that went back. It isn't because I think anyone will intentionally try to mess things up, but its an administrative process and things are bound to go awry. Don't get me started on returning cable boxes to Frontier...
3887	September 26, 2019 10:10PM	andres3	"I specifically asked the lady, is there no paper work? She said ""no, you're all done and all set."" I took 2 photos of the car for my own sake, but I didn't think I had to take a picture of ever nook and cranny given the pre-inspection documentation.

Never thought to take pictures of both Key FOB's. I think Kia outsources disposition fees to a collection agency. That's the vibe I get for sure! They don't care about photos or documentation, only about getting their money. They want me to force the dealership to admit they lost it in writing, so they can demand $350 from them. I really don't feel like working for free.

Maybe there isn't someone selling Key FOB's every week at Kia, but it sure seems like it. It his horrible customer service putting me in the middle of this. I probably won't lease again just because of this, let alone mess with Kia ever again."

EDIT: This is also why when purchasing a new car, the advice is to make sure you have everything you were promised before you sign off on that We Owe sheet. Once you sign that you're agreeing that everything is as promised - anything you figure out after that and bring up with the dealer (lost keys or otherwise) is done out of the kindness of the dealer's heart."

Are you serious? Expecting competence by any person or organization that you haven't dealt with before labels you as incredibly naive or, well, just let's leave it at that.."
3896	September 27, 2019 12:32AM	xwesx	Every used car I've ever purchased (from a dealer), save one, has only come with one FOB. Ridiculous, IMO, but most likely more common than not. That one dealer was Gaier in Fort Loramie, OH. Also the best dealer interaction I've ever had. Good folk there.
3897	September 27, 2019 1:31AM	andres3	"I work in construction, where things that are lost most likely grew legs and walked away, not just disappeared. Key FOB's are a fairly large object to be losing, I could see a key, a single key, but a Key FOB?

Everyone knows they cost $350, lol!

I think theft is more often the cause of ""lost items"" than people realize."

3899	September 27, 2019 1:43AM	stickguy	"should have hooked them together. At least eliminates the accidental separation!

I think a lot of newer used cars only come with 1 because they are ex rentals. You only ever get one key with those, so I always wondered where they keep the 2nd one. Some kind of cabinet at the home office? There must be thousands of spare keys floating around at Hertz and Avis."
3900	September 27, 2019 1:55AM	nyccarguy	Tonight was “open school night” at my 13 year old son’s middle school. Parking lot is jammed. I see people are parked on the grass. My wife notices this too and says: don’t even think about parking on the grass! As I drive closer, there is a guy signaling cars to park on the grass. My 1st Off Road
3901	September 27, 2019 2:05AM	tjc78	My last couple rentals had both FOBs secured together on a locked ring. Made for a very inconvenient (big) key to carry around.

3907	September 27, 2019 11:02AM	qbrozen	"Made an assist last night. My brother requested help finding a backup vehicle. I sent him 6 private party vehicles yesterday morn. He chose 2 to focus on: 2004 CRV with 115k miles and 2008 Nissan Quest 3.5S with 111k miles. Each a bit north of $3k. Honda sold by the afternoon, so he asked me to meet him at 7pm at the Quest owner’s house 30 mins from me. Long story short, we wound up buying it for $2750. Runs great, body is remarkably clean, and it is hard to argue the value. Let’s see how long it takes him to kill this one.

He is considering buying an additional. I sent him a former taxi C-max with 105k for $1850. I know nothing about them, though. Just thought it could be good value even if he gets just a year out pf it."
3908	September 27, 2019 11:16AM	tjc78	"At those price points If they last a year without costing him big bucks it’s less than many of our monthly lease payments!

This summer I went down to the San Juan mountains of Colorado for vacation and got to take mine on some true off roading trails (former mining roads, etc.).

3912	September 27, 2019 1:41PM	nyccarguy	If you'd like, you can take me to lunch too so I can give a thorough review of your S60 . The one thing I LOVED & was SCARED of with my Infiniti. Strong acceleration at any given speed if I needed it. On the highway if I was going 65-70 and wanted to pass, triple digits came up fairly quickly with a quick stab of the gas pedal.

I had a friend who had one for a while or before think they sold it or whatever happen with it needs some work. But I think they paid $3000 for theirs I thought it was nice for 2480 something thousand miles on it for what it was in the band van. And I was was a fan of those from the beginning when they came out remember sitting in them at the car show. Yeah see what second car was good to have a back up even if he kills both always use this cheaper than leasing for the most part.

3916	September 27, 2019 2:15PM	marcogallo1986	Good morning Lal, I hope that everyone had a good week, happy Friday everyone. This morning went for a session at the gym with my trainer. Had a brand new 2019 Honda accord in blue liked it. And leather not sure what trim it was rolled fine I thought. Then on the way back got a new generation or X red with either tan gray interior road nice for the four-cylinder which is the only engine option I believe. So what’s in cars today with both my top favorite color choices that’s a real usually they’re older records or other stuff. What is our DX, I was in on the way back home just now. he’s white I meant to say a few sentences back in this posting. Was talking with my dad the other day when I went for a haircut, he’s in a lean more towards something a couple of years old probably next year in January or something we’re gonna start looking at sometime a few now. I think he wants to stick with Hyundai and Kia. Although he likes the jeep grand Cherokee a lot too. He tells me is you stuff is expensive, I told him you got a remember what it cost new even more expensive you’re getting it at a significant savings. Two or three years old.
3917	September 27, 2019 2:26PM	corvette	"@nyccarguy I thought your Tacoma had a package which included LED lights?

Water company left a note on my door and said there’s no problem on their end. My neighbors also report no issues. I picked up a water pressure gauge at Lowe’s and will investigate further once I’m back home. Got behind a new Corvette with dealer plates in Bowling Green last night. I guess the new model is on sale?"

3924	September 27, 2019 4:02PM	28firefighter	Nope - that is a definite return. I'm more curious to see how close to reality these Tacoma/Tundra residuals end up being.
3925	September 27, 2019 4:06PM	pensfan83	They are pretty darn close based on a quick walk of the Toyota lot when we were waiting for F&I.

Most of the expert reviews put it behind the BMW and Audi, but I think that is mainly because it isn't as sporty as those. The Volvo infotainment gets knocked too, but once you learn it, I find it pretty easy. If you can operate an Ipad you can use the Volvo stuff."
3927	September 27, 2019 5:51PM	andres3	Curious.... when I last looked at Volvo's supposed S4 competitor hot rod model, it had something like relatively skinny 225 tires. What is your current S60 T6 putting on for shoes?
3928	September 27, 2019 5:57PM	tjc78	Not much bigger
3929	September 27, 2019 6:13PM	ab348	I was pricing Volvos just for laffs and I don't know if Canada pricing is significantly higher than in the USA even after accounting for exchange rates, but up here they are squarely in M-B and BMW territory. A big change from the days when my dad used to drive them.
3930	September 27, 2019 6:26PM	breld	I'm often browsing for used V90's these days, but they're still pretty scarce. For kicks, I started looking at used (current model) S90's - man, those are a good deal!
3931	September 27, 2019 6:30PM	stickguy	If I get a Volvo, buy or lease, it will almost certainly be a lightly used service loaner. Ditto for an X3.
3932	September 27, 2019 6:41PM	nyccarguy	Last year when I did the BMWCCA instructional driving, one of the instructors was an electrical engineer. He was given a Chinese built S90 to review. He said it was put together absolutely perfect. He looked for things & measured panel gaps with a micrometer.

However when the car arrived at my house the first thing I checked was the spare tire and sitting on top of it under the cover was a folder with the owners manual and the other fob. I told the delivery person and he told me he they would have charged more for the car if they knew..

Debris and glass left in the car, cuts not done, seals not replaced, and scratches not buffed. Not to mention, someone put scratches in my piano black trim when they decided to put on the parking brake for who knows why! Yes, I'm still dealing with this Q8 windshield after a month.
3942	September 27, 2019 10:58PM	ab348	It's sort of The Eagles Light from what I understand. Henley, Walsh and Tim Schmit along with Deacon Frey (Glenn's son) and Vince Gill. I just finished Don Felder's book about his time in the band before getting fired by Henley and Frey in '01. Written from his unhappy POV of course but an interesting read. In their heyday all of them were always arguing with each other and when they came back in '94 Henley and Frey began to throw their weight around, which Felder disliked and things all went downhill for him after that. Without him and Frey I'm sure the songs sound about the same but they really can't be the same.

3947	September 28, 2019 1:36AM	Sandman6472	"Driving a couple of vehicles today and listening to the Sat/XM on the radio and then...nothing. Thought it was a bit weird the first time this morning. Happened again after lunch in a second vehicle. We drivers began to check with each other and same thing happened to them. Come to find out later in the day that SAT radio will no longer be free in our vehicles, there's going to be a slight charge to get it if the vehicle is so equipped.Just seemed strange that it stopped in one vehicle and a few hours later, did it again.
Remember when some of the newer 2019's arrived, they only came with AM/FM as the only two choices. This seems to be happening more and more on newer arrivals I'm betting. Luckily I carry my lightning cord with me so I can use my iPhone to hear music. With 882 songs in my iTunes account now, it'll take me awhile to hear them all and since I shuffle them, never know what's going to come on next. Hate to keep it in alphabetical order as eventually, I'll learn the order of the tunes and really, what fun is that? Better to be a random selection and since I do have so many, works for me."
3948	September 28, 2019 1:46AM	Sandman6472	"Getting the side pathway done tomorrow afternoon. Found a handyman guy from our development's website. Asked for any recommendations from others around here and this guy got great reviews. He already came out today to see it in person as e liked the pics I sent, but wanted to see things close up. The wife is going to meet him at Home Depot tomorrow to pay for the sand and concrete if we go that way. For the extra $30, seems better to have him use concrete so things will never move again once it's done. Hate to see him level out the ground where the pavers go and only use sand to knock them into place. Who knows if down the line they might shift a bit or let the grass come back between them. For a little extra in materials, going with the concrete seems to be a more permanent fix which is a good thing.
Once done, no more ""honey do"" projects for 2019 and anything else she, we want will have to get done in fiscal year 2020. I'm a bit tapped out here and still have property taxes coming up in November and the other half of the homeowners insurance coming due in December, since we split the bill this year.
So, we're done with home improvement stuff after this pathway gets repaired."

I had one as a rental last year, an XLE model with a sunroof, and I liked it, especially the interior. This new one looks so much better outside and they did a great job with the interior. Guessing this new tablet style infotainment system will be around for awhile. I see it on many of the 2019 models that we now have in our fleet. Luckily, my iPhone works with almost all of them and many have the Apple Car Play system already integrated already. Makes it easier to navigate to a new address with Siri giving me my directions through the speakers in the vehicle as I can put the phone down and just listen. I might get that coffee mug/cell phone holder I've seen in Motor Trend as right now, have no place to mount my phone and won't get one of those kinds that sticks to the windshield as they get in my field of vision and leave nasty marks on the window.
Well, said I'd work from 9 to noon today so gotta go shower and hit the road. The few extra hours are nice as I've been dollar cost averaging on a couple of stocks lately, so the extra cash is coming in handy! Just trying to increase my income flow for when I do retire and not getting a steady paycheck from working. I guess one of the reasons I'm still working as I feel one can never have enough in the bank to sustain the same kind of lifestyle once work ceases to be what I do most of the time. We talked about traveling around America since they really enjoyed the mountains of North Georgia and there's so much we haven't seen.

And she made a ""but it's a Cadillac"" face and comments. I even showed her one today we parked next to. Admitted it looked OK, but another ""it's a Cadillac"". I even pointed out how it was way nicer than her car, but she just said there were other cars that were too, that weren't any more expensive.

For someone that knows nothing about cars, she became quite the car (brand) snob! I assumed she refused to consider Ford because her father/uncles were Chevy/GM (Olds, then Caddy) buyers. But she won't look at Chevy either, and is anti-Caddy.

Conversation? What conversation? They don't have any clue what I own.

That did it for me, so last night I sent her a pretty stiff email saying basically that the campaign is misleading and sleazy, and that they have erased any inclination I might have had for ever doing business with them in the future because of all the false statements in the string of emails. I mentioned these were something she likely had to send thanks to management direction, so it wasn't personal, but that I was done with them."

I thought it was personal, turns out, she just did not like the seats in the couple that were in the family.

Acura of course she likes. Hyundai she was fine with. BMW, and Volvo, no issue there (other than $). The Mazda she liked, and is OK with that brand,

Subaru I think she is fine with the badge, just doesn't want ""a wagon"".

She won't take a GM or Ford, and Jeep would be a really tough sell."

Flew down out of Paine Field this morning, was in and out in 20 minutes and hit the road. Stopped near Olympia to charge and grab a bite. Traffic through Tacoma was an absolute nightmare.

Thanks for the well wishes, @jmonroe. You got the words right - how you got there doesn’t matter unless you’re typing in Hebrew, as @suydam said."

4000	September 29, 2019 4:48PM	qbrozen	huh. So I went to order a hub assembly for my Equinox off Amazon for $70. An option came up to have someone come to my house and install it for $145. Based on what I’ve seen on the interwebs on changing the damned thing, I figured that could be well worth it. I’m very curious to see how this works out. I'd love to have a cheap option like this considering all the projects I have going on around here.
4001	September 29, 2019 4:53PM	tjc78	I’ve seen the Amazon install thing on a lot of items. The most recent was a TV mount I ordered for work. $99 to mount a TV. Not bad.
4002	September 29, 2019 5:05PM	jmonroe1	"As long as they don't use dry wall anchors like a guy down the street had happen to him. The good thing is, they bought him a new TV which he said was a better unit than he originally had. In his case newer was better.

4003	September 29, 2019 5:15PM	tjc78	"That’s brutal. Some of the new LED sets are so light a good toggle bolt would do.

When the maintenance guys hung my TV in my office at work they used those plastic large screw in anchors. I questioned it but it hasn’t fallen yet.

Any TV I’ve hung has been Into the studs with 3” lag bolts.

I hung a 60” Panasonic plasma years ago for someone. Weighed a TON. Used four giant lag bolts and two toggle bolts."
4004	September 29, 2019 5:22PM	stickguy	"these days I think the mounting bracket weighs more than the TV. I hung a 43"" set in my bedroom a few years ago. Must have done OK at it, since it has not fallen down. I assume I put the screws into studs."

4006	September 29, 2019 7:17PM	Sandman6472	"Nice vehicle! A pal of mine is trying to get me to seriously look at a Chevy Bolt as my next vehicle. Not sure about electric as the infrastructure down south here ain't the best for electric vehicles. Thinking I should jump in the pool slowly and try a hybrid like the Hyundai Ionig which seem to be quite popular down here. The range on an electric vehicle might be a bit low as I'd like to have it at around 300 miles. I could see charging it at home over night in the garage without changing out the current plug for one with more charge to it.
Since I won't be in the market for another 18 months or so, will just keep researching and go from there. As much as I'd love to get a 2020 model, the Golf is behaving currently and since I just put on new sneakers all around, want to keep it in the stable at least until I quit Hertz, and when that will be is anybody's guess right now!
Happy New Year folks!!"
4007	September 29, 2019 7:29PM	jmonroe1	"Those plastic anchors you describe are the ones used when my neighbor had his TV professionally installed, which fell in about 6 months. Before they did it he questioned them about it and they told him because the LED TV's today are so light they have been using them for a few years with no trouble. Well, it didn't work for him. Obviously they didn't do something right.

FWIW, Son #1 is installing high and low video and power receptacles in the flip house he is finishing up. He is going to mark the walls with tape to show where the studs are for whomever buys it. I've told him several times he's putting too much lipstick on a pig. Just something he wants to do, in all 4 bedrooms and the living room. I asked him if he is going to provide a picture to hide the high outlets if the buyer doesn't like the looks of them? That he is not going to do. I think he's running out of lipstick.

jmonroe"
4008	September 29, 2019 7:48PM	corvette	I went into the attic and put a brace between two studs so I'd have something solid to bolt my articulating TV mount to. Ironically, I almost never watch that TV.

4012	September 29, 2019 7:51PM	marcogallo1986	So I’m realizing with leasing you have to put down a crazy amount of money I have a low payment was trying to look at leasing a Mustang GT just cause I can. One dealer told me they’re not leasing them currently right now only be globalist one. Other dealers I haven’t heard back from him as of yet. Trying to put down as little money as possible. But the payment is going to be skyhigh ones or buy a used one if I need to pay for something a month or $500 ha ha Ha.
4013	September 29, 2019 7:52PM	marcogallo1986	Also looking into leasing a charger RT automatic haven’t heard back from any of those dealers yet.
4014	September 29, 2019 7:53PM	28firefighter	"You don’t have to put down crazy money on a lease to get the payment down. It’s how dealers tell you you have to, but several of us here have crazy low payments and put basically nothing down at signing.

My i3 is $225 at signing and $225 a month including tax."
4015	September 29, 2019 7:57PM	stickguy	I would have leased one at that point, just to have for the wife to commute with!
4016	September 29, 2019 8:33PM	corvette	Insanely good deal, @28firefighter ! I'd love to have a deal like that, but I'm not sure I even drive 10,000 miles a year any more, and that's split amongst two vehicles. Plus I have a single car garage and single width driveway--that was one of the factors which discouraged me from buying multiple TDIs when the Dieselgate thing was going on, although I probably could have stored as many as I wanted at my family's farm.
4017	September 29, 2019 8:38PM	mjfloyd1	My wife thought I’d get screwed with the dieselgate Passat that I bought. I should have bought a couple more. Although the wife argues that she is “rarely wrong”😭
4018	September 29, 2019 8:42PM	stickguy	I really should have bought the twin to the Jetta QB bought. I remember they had 2 practically identical ones at the time.
4019	September 29, 2019 8:51PM	corvette	There was a dealer in Lexington that had 4 or 5 of them. Hindsight being 20/20, I should've tried to do a package deal to buy all of them, delivered. If they weren't willing to deliver, I could've Ubered it there x 5, but that would've been time consuming.
4020	September 29, 2019 8:54PM	corvette	"I was doing my month-end stuff and projected (roughly) a $500 surplus at the end of next month. Set up an extra $500 payment on the G37 note, then realized there was an autopay of the same amount on my credit card, that I hadn't entered in figuring the surplus. Oops. I'm trying to keep less money in my checking account anyway, so that should definitely ""help"" with that issue!"

4029	September 29, 2019 11:34PM	ab348	Speaking of that, at the Kia dealer here today I saw several 2020 models with window stickers like this one. Pricing for the 2020 models is apparently not announced yet so they put these on them. Seems an odd, perhaps risky, way to do it. I am half-thinking of showing up there tomorrow and demanding to buy the car at that price.
4030	September 29, 2019 11:40PM	marcogallo1986	@28ff you got an awesome deal on the new car lease deal, I know you want to put down a ton of money I would like to ideally do a sign and drive. One dealer said if I put down the taxes and first months payment which is almost $2000 $420 a month it’s not even a loaded one it’s a basic basic basic mustang. I got back to them and said the payments are too high and I don’t wanna put on anything maybe first months payment that’s it. Haven’t heard much from any Dodge dealers as of yet. But you know I’m gonna keep trying because were chronic car buyers in here.
4031	September 29, 2019 11:41PM	marcogallo1986	It wasn’t even a GT Mustang, that’s the one dealer that said they don’t lease them currently Ford right now. It was on an eco-boost one. We’re trying to get confirmation from other dealers if it’s true right now Ford doesn’t list the GT Mustangs. can you look on their website too. Contacted a few dealers.
4032	September 29, 2019 11:42PM	corvette	"That's weird. I remember seeing some cars (not Kia, maybe Ford) having stickers with the VIN and option info, but no pricing, and NOT FOR SALE very clearly printed on them, until pricing was finalized.

My parents' Q5 was supposed to be a service loaner and there was something about ""not for retail sale"" on the sticker. I think it had just come off the truck, and the dealer was able to reassign it before it got put in the loaner fleet."
4033	September 29, 2019 11:42PM	marcogallo1986	@ Send man, that’s awesome you’re some time to do your searching and if next year or the year after he decide to make a punch whatever works for you but always good to be on the lookout look out ha ha Ha.

4070	October 1, 2019 12:50AM	roadburner	"Here's my review of an M340i xDrive loaner from a few weeks ago:

It’s maybe a tick faster than my 2 Series, but the xDrive filters the fun too much for my tastes. I scared a friend quite a bit accelerating through a corner flat out when he thought I was going to lift and brake.
I like the interior a lot- including the glass cockpit.
I like the latest generation of iDrive, but it’s considerably different from what I’m used to.
The voice recognition works quickly and accurately.
The base sound system is surprisingly good. I’d still want to audition the H-K upgrade, but the standard system is no slouch.
It’s still too big for my tastes, but the car masks its bulk to an impressive degree.
An M240i with the M340i cockpit, 382 hp motor, and M Sport diff would be just about perfect for me.
That or an M2C..."
4071	October 1, 2019 1:18AM	qbrozen	Of course! I’m especially curious to hear about running with the ICE, if at all. How that changes the drivability, etc.
4072	October 1, 2019 1:40AM	corvette	As did my beloved E39 540i M-Sport. The G37 doesn't feel as solid, but also doesn't leak random fluids on my garage floor.

4074	October 1, 2019 3:12AM	andres3	"I do love the horsepower wars. It seems whereas 300 HP used to be the standard of acceptability in a true sports car, now you need close to 400 horsepower to keep up with the Jones.

I think 300 HP is a magic mark for any car to make it a nice drive."
4075	October 1, 2019 3:14AM	stickguy	"I caught up on my pile of car magazines today. One had an article talking about HP/torque, and the question ""can there be too much?"" And how the performance return basically stopped when you ran out of enough traction. Or the weak link in the system could not handle any more!"
4076	October 1, 2019 3:25AM	andres3	All you need is quattro with launch control.
4077	October 1, 2019 4:10AM	28firefighter	"OK. So I’ve got about 250 miles on the i3 as of today. Had 26 on the ODO when I bought it and then it was roughly 183 miles from Portland. Random errands this weekend and then about 35 miles of driving today.

Styling. This thing is darn quirky. But I seriously like it and I have no explanation as to why. The dimensions are bizarre for sure, but it works and it seems to get a lot of attention. The interior is a really nice place to spend time - mine is equipped with the dark truffle vernasca leather, oak wood, the Tech package and HK radio. It looks upscale and feels upscale. The backseat is reasonably usable and holds Sam’s car seat nicely. Even doing the suicide door shuffle to get him in isn’t so bad. One minor nit is that neither of the front seats has power - all manual adjustment to conserve weight. Personally I’d have sacrificed a tenth of a second to 60 for a power adjustment option. The dash controls are a bit of a stretch from the driver’s seat but not terrible. It’s all laid out in a well organized and easy to access manner. The heated seats will set your rear on fire at the highest setting.

Technology. It’s got one of the more recent iterations of iDrive which I could operate in my sleep at this point. Love it or hate it, it is what it is. Since I know it well, I’m very happy with it. One nice feature is that with the Tech Package you get CarPlay that works both wired and wirelessly. Basically when I turn on the car, CarPlay is immediately accessible. CarPlay is definitely faster via USB, though. The HK stereo is fine - fills the car nicely but nothing to write home about. One feature I did use on the drive home was ACC really easy to use and made a long drive much more enjoyable.

Driving experience. The electric driving experience is truly unlike anything else. The single biggest adjustment challenge I’m having is no engine noise. Beyond that, it is a total hoot to tool around in. Downright quick up to 40-50 mph and then the responsiveness slows a bit. The more you get on it, the worse the efficiency is. No surprise there. Because the car is RWD the handling is really quite good, even with the narrow width tires and the turning radius is comically tight.

Range. Too early to call. With our 35 miles of mixed driving today we had 74% range remaining when we got home tonight. If that held we’d be seeing about 140 miles per charge which seems more than reasonable and higher than the BMW estimate. The range extender is designed to kick on at 6% battery remaining. I tested it out briefly on the way home from the dealer - it kicked on as I was getting off the highway to fast charge. At highway speeds you don’t even hear it, but at around town speeds you will know you have a scooter in your backseat. It’s annoying so I’m not planning to use it more than absolutely in a pinch.

Overall we really like it so far. Totally quirky and fun to drive. The instant torque of the EV is addicting."
4078	October 1, 2019 4:10AM	Michaell	Or electricity. I've seen a number of videos comparing a Tesla Model S to a variety of race cars, and the Tesla wins each time.
4079	October 1, 2019 4:28AM	Sandman6472	"Have heard the same about the Bolt's seats from others so we'll just have to see. Have driven the Nitto at work and do like it especially since it's a 5 door vehicle. Only mentioned the Ioniq as the Hyundai dealership is right outside one of the entrances to our community, with the Kia store on the lower side of town and since we've still got a Hyundai product in the family, could get a some more off when purchasing like I did with the Tucson. Got an extra $500 rebate due to having a immediate family member owning one.
Assuming the Ioniq drives similarly to the Nitto but will have to check that out. The idea of possibly getting around 50 mpg's is a nice thing really but my only negative right now is the life span of the battery pack and how expensive it'll be to swap them out later on down the road. Could get expensive if one owns it, and might be better to lease one instead.
Very intrigued about ownership of any hybrid or electric vehicle to be honest. Would help with my longish commute right now to be honest."

The first guy says that one never knows what could happen and when, so keeping both parts just makes sense if affordable. A good argument for sure but saving that extra outlay each month for just such things is a good thing to.
Will be speaking with a few others and go from there. Leaning towards just keeping both parts right now as the wiser move. Really, who knows what could happen going forward?"

4088	October 1, 2019 12:56PM	stickguy	Sandy, the batteries already have long warranty. It’s highly unlikely you would ever run out of that. They tend to last a long time anyway.
4089	October 1, 2019 1:04PM	mjfloyd1	It’s the town and not the state
4090	October 1, 2019 1:20PM	marcogallo1986	@qb wow wow, that stinks it’s actually bring it somewhere for the appointment I thought they came to your house, but I guess you have to tackle the project yourself with the hubs when you get a chance. As long as it’s not unsafe to drive for the time being.
4091	October 1, 2019 1:21PM	marcogallo1986	So me and my cousin had an awesome time yesterday test roll a dodge charger RT had to stop myself from putting a lease deal together with maybe just the first months payment but eventually you gonna do something probably. Then went to another Ford dealer to look around and then to another one to look around and then at night went back to the first dealer which is close to my house and drove a Ford Ranger XLT was a lot of fun.
4092	October 1, 2019 1:23PM	marcogallo1986	Today somewhere looking he’s coming back look at something out here so will spend the day together, I have to go pick up the core of my battery because they were covered under the warranty because they said that I killed it I mean I did but enough to know the truth I told him the battery is the Factive from day one they disconnected the battery cables and let it sit for two weeks in and went dead he’s been going dead ever since now won’t hold a charge. It is five months old so probably have to buy another battery regardless just woke up without battery and brand again. Just gonna go to AutoZone or Pep Boys closer to my house and more convenient and get a born own battery brand. this prior battery that’s dead now another person and helps me out insisted I get it because if it’s in the battery tray 100% correct which initially I didn’t care about is like some special rectangle shape which is real hard to fine so I’m sure the battery was sitting around for a while somewhere in the warehouse because how many people are buying them I was gonna get a standard battery if it doesn’t fit 100% who cares the car is not being driven every day.
4093	October 1, 2019 1:42PM	nyccarguy	@28firefighter - great write up regarding the i3. Definitely seems like a great little car that handles well (it is a BMW after all). Seems like you got it for a great price & will enjoy it for the next 24 months/10K per year. With the lease and the range extender it seems like a fantastic way to dip your feet into driving an EV.
4094	October 1, 2019 1:47PM	corvette	@28firefighter are you going to hack it to enable the “hold state of charge” feature? I think that would make it a lot more versatile.
4095	October 1, 2019 2:34PM	28firefighter	"I sent a note to our friend @roadburner asking for his take. My only fear enabling it is that it may void my warranty and that is definitely not something I want to do here. I'm sure the official stance is ""no chance"" from BMW because it probably messes with vehicle classification or some such here in the US, but the question is whether they would check/notice otherwise."
4096	October 1, 2019 2:38PM	corvette	I think it’s simply a matter of using an OBD tool to change a setting. It’s not like you’re installing a chip on a turbocharged car, so hopefully they will look at it differently.
4097	October 1, 2019 2:40PM	28firefighter	It really is not the end of the world either way. Yesterday turned out to be 42 miles of driving and that was a very heavy day for me driving wise. I used up 25%+ of the battery. I plugged it into a standard household outlet at 8pm when we got home and had a notification that the car was charged around 4am. That is just about perfect, IMO.
4098	October 1, 2019 3:11PM	breld	"Nice write-up @28firefighter - in my brief ownership period of our i3, I enjoyed it for the same reasons you state.

The one thing that got quite tiresome was those suicide doors. I found it awkward at times to get around to allow my stepson out of the backseat.

Other than that, the limitations of the i3 for me were more situational - since we had a 2015, the electric range was only like 70-80 miles. With the longer commute I had at the time, we invariable dipped into the extender more often than not, and while it's definitely a nice feature to have to alleviate range anxiety, I did find it a bit loud and intrusive...and having to stop and fill up the 1.5 gallon tank on a regular basis sort of defeated the purpose of the car.

But...with our recent move and resulting shorter commute, together with the extended range of the newer models, makes the i3 a more attractive option. We test drove a Bolt a couple years ago when we had the i3 and while we appreciated the range of the Chevy, we liked the i3 much better all around (probably not surprising).

I'm anxious for the release of the upcoming VW electric fleet. And I'm also intrigued by the CR-V Hybrid due out early next year."
4099	October 1, 2019 3:30PM	stickguy	I still don’t think I could go full electric (or even like the i3 solution), but would love a nice hybrid.
4100	October 1, 2019 4:20PM	marcogallo1986	@28ff Nice write up on your new ride so far awesome. It’s definitely different which is a good thing.
4101	October 1, 2019 4:20PM	marcogallo1986	Got to also sit in a brand new 2020 for the ski, I didn’t like it the old one was parked next week still new like it a lot better higher up.
4102	October 1, 2019 6:38PM	nyccarguy	"I could totally go full electric. Once government incentives are gone, Tesla Model 3 prices are likely to come down and they’ll lease like most “regular” gas powered cars.

So my wife took a job as a Home Care Physical Therapist. It’s not what she wants, but the pay is decent & she can keep looking for a hospital gig. She will get reimbursed on a per mile basis when driving from one client’s house to another (not to the 1st patient or home from the last patient). We’ll also be able to write off a portion of her Pilot’s gas & depreciation since she is required to use her personal vehicle for work. I’m going to see how she likes this. It might be worth it to lease her a car specifically for work so I can write off a portion of the lease payment. She’s going to start piling the miles on her Pilot very quickly."
4103	October 1, 2019 6:46PM	corvette	"@nyccarguy look into whether the mileage reimbursement meets the IRS guidelines. If it does, I don’t think you can write off your expenses, but the reimbursement itself is tax-free money.

Glad your wife found something, even if it’s not what her preferred working situation looks like."
4104	October 1, 2019 7:25PM	qbrozen	it should work itself out at tax time. you'd get a vehicle reimbursement statement and that pay would be deducted from whatever mileage you are claiming on your taxes. At least, that's my interpretation. Kind of like a health FSA plan.
4105	October 1, 2019 7:36PM	corvette	I guess different employers handle it differently. I’ve never had mileage or other reimbursements reported on a W-2.
4106	October 1, 2019 8:19PM	kyfdx	"I agree with this.

If you are getting the IRS mileage reimbursement, then you can't write off expenses or depreciation. If you claim expenses, then you have to claim the mileage reimbursement as income."
4107	October 1, 2019 10:05PM	benjaminh	If you're willing to share, I'd be interested in your experience so far of the financial pros and cons of the i3.
4108	October 1, 2019 10:48PM	28firefighter	"@benjaminh - I left more a detailed review a 5-10 posts back.

The financial pros and cons are probably not what they would be for most. I spend anywhere from $75-$100 a month on fuel for my personal driving and had a monthly nut of $350 including tax on the X1.

The i3 lease is incredibly cheap - $225 due at signing and $225/month including tax for 24 months, 10k miles per year. If I'm able to take advantage of a sales tax exemption here in WA, my costs will drop to about $145/month. In terms of electric costs, a rough calculation based on my driving habits and a blended charge per kwh here in Seattle (about $0.11/kwh) shows my energy consumption will be about $15-$20/month. So between the monthly savings on payment and savings on fuel, my monthly savings (assuming no tax exemption) will be anywhere from $180-$210/month."
4109	October 2, 2019 1:05AM	Sandman6472	"28FF, that sounds pretty good to be honest. I like the vehicle but since I drive around 13K miles/year, I'd need to have better terms. It really is the perfect size for me as I like a smaller vehicle, we both do. Looks to be fun to drive to.
Got to drive the Toyota CR-V again at work today, my lead knows how much I like it. The one real issue for me is the rear blind spot is pretty big in the C-pillar area. I drove a silver over black model and it was quite dark back there in the middle of a sunny day. Guess the interior doesn't get that warm. Just wondering if they have an ash or gray interior which should lighten things up a bit. They are a blast to drive and honestly, the looks are growing on me. Could definitely see myself in one on a daily basis and since we use the A3 when we go out mostly, shouldn't be an issue with the other half. But also like the Corolla hatch to be honest. Just not sure if Sirius/XM is an option on either of them. Would have no issue going back to a Toyota to be honest as I do love the smaller size of both. And since both have Apple Car Play, I could give up my XM if really necessary though I'd be unhappy.
Stick, glad to hear that the batteries of a hybrid should last a decent amount of time as I like the idea of increased mpg's. Just have to decide if I really want to get something new in 2020 or wait another year or two. Right now, the Golf is behaving very nicely and having new sneakers has just added to the fun."
4110	October 2, 2019 1:47AM	laurasdada	"Hi, Folks: Back from an Eastern Caribbean cruise that became a Western Caribbean cruise. Wonderful, either way. I never weigh myself, but probably gained 5 or 6 lbs! Totally worth it.

My XF was parked for over a week at a public lot (as always, took bus to Logan). Interestingly, the formerly (and perhaps again) rear left failing tail light, is now working fine. CEL is on, throwing a broad code, bringing to my mechanic on Thursday. The diagnosis will guide me in the next step.

College boy got an internship, ""needs"" a car, as previously noted. He expects, and told his mom that I would be buying a new car (Dad, you have like 5 years left. Treat yourself!) and giving him the XF. Um, likely no. If Dad does go new, XF is trade or Carvana/Vroom/CarMax bound.

Told boy more than likely, if/when I talk to the ex to confirm, I'll shop for a used Fusion/Milan, Mazda 3/6, Altima etc. for him. Looking at max $9k OTD. I4 to keep the kid who learned to drive on Grand Theft Auto in somewhat check.

One other thought, the ex hardly drives her '11 535xi. I'm told she's Tesla shopping. She planned to give the '21 college graduate her car, so perhaps she'll accelerate that plan? Either a long road trip from OR to MA or ~$1200 to ship east.

But, as mentioned, nothing currently is exciting me enough to trade for the XF. At least not until the year end, as is my tradition to get deal o rama. But, he needs wheels end of October. Or, Uber..."
4111	October 2, 2019 3:04AM	benjaminh	Wow. That is a great deal.++
4112	October 2, 2019 3:45AM	Sandman6472	"So guessing the car can ""juice up"" in probably 8 hours which seems reasonable. Now, if one gets the better set-up with a special plug, if there is such a thing, betting that time could be cut by almost a quarter. And I forgot what the range is but would have to be enough for one to do ""normal"" driving around town the next day.
How does one find out about which city has charging stations and their locations. That's why I'm thinking of possibly going hybrid next time as overall, it just might be a bit easier. Betting the infrastructure of charging locations need to increase going forward so more folks can use this system. The idea of forward proportion with less petrol is very intriguing to be honest. And like the idea of the vehicle being so quiet when accelerating. Price wise though, not really sure most Americans are willing to go the all electric as of now, it being a longer process to get folks to join up. Hybrids seem to be an easier way to go if one really wants to go in this direction.
I really do want to join up so thinking a hybrid should be my first step forward."
4113	October 2, 2019 4:07AM	Sandman6472	"And think leasing might just be the way to go here also but again, I'd need an agreement with more miles/year. Glad more and more name plates are jumping on the bandwagon here with hybrids and electric vehicles. Saw a new Kia Nitto by the airport today and it's a 5 door which I prefer.
Picked up about 5 brand new Nissan Muranos at the Miami airport lot and they all had the plastic on the wheel covers and in the interior, all with less than 6 miles on them. Not much petrol so we had to go over to the rental center at MIA to get them filled up a bit. They drove very nicely and couldn't tell if they had a CVT tranny propelling them. All I know is that when I pushed my foot down on the accelerator, off I went and driving on the always crowded 826 & 836 was effortless! They're a bit too big for me, but for most folk, a Murano isn't a bad choice. Saw a mess load of new 2020 Hyundai Sante Fe's there also and even more up at the Ft. Lauderdale lot. Have driven a few of them plus the new Tucson/Sportage cousins and Hyundai/Kia has some nice vehicles in their current line-up. Glad to see more and more 2020 models being put on the road, as many of the complaints I hear are from customers saying our fleet is a bit too old. But from what I can see, Hertz is doing all it can to get those new vehicles on the road for service.
Seems like I'm back with the other drivers now and am volunteering to go to to that other HLE location on Saturdays. Was there a couple times today and my boss there tells me he's also asked to have me come back but the big guy isn't budging on his decision to put me back on the team with the other drivers. Must admit, just having that extra body helps in getting more vehicles moved each day, so I can see the logic in bringing me back over to the group, I'm just not happy about it. At first, wasn't pleased about going and the way they did it, but made lemonade out of the lemons and don't think it's fair to pull me away again after only 3 months. But again, I wasn't consulted in the original decision to send me over nor with the decision to bring me back. The only good thing is that I'm doing a lot more driving which I'm happy with. Truth be told, I love breaking in brand new vehicles and this time of year, we sure do get a lot of them, so many that not all of them can go straight to one of the two airports. So this part, I'm really enjoying and hopefully, we'll have some more trips to Ft. Myers and Vero Beach in the near future as just love the longer trips especially getting behind the wheel of something new or something I've never driven before. It's helped more whittle down my short list immensely!"
4114	October 2, 2019 4:36AM	28firefighter	With my driving each day it can easily juice up each night.
4115	October 2, 2019 11:57AM	tjc78	"@Sandman6472

Your gig is perfect for a semi-retired car lover!

The other one I would consider if it were me would be a courtesy shuttle driver for a new car dealer. At the Buick dealer near me they have two older guys, one works early shift and one late. They get to drive around the local area in a new SUV either picking up parts or customers. Good way to kill a few hours everyday."
4116	October 2, 2019 12:32PM	stickguy	I could see doing that for pocket money and to get out of the house. Doing dealer swaps sounds even better.
4117	October 2, 2019 5:47PM	suydam	Your questions are exactly why I got the Chevy Volt instead of a full EV. I think it’s really stupid of Chevy to have ditched that model. It’s such a great bridge vehicle for those who are unsure about going the EV route. Right now I’m looking into some EVs to possibly replace it in December if I don’t buy out at lease end.
4118	October 2, 2019 6:49PM	tifighter	How much gas have you used in your Volt since you've had it?
4119	October 2, 2019 6:50PM	mjfloyd1	"Someone must have put an “I want to race a Ford Forus or Honda Civic” sign on my RS7.

I have not laughed so hard in a long time"
4120	October 2, 2019 7:10PM	Sandman6472	"I've tried numerous times at the new car dealerships right near our place, did the VW store a few months back once my service advisor told me one of the service drivers left. Filled out another app that same day and left it on the desk of the hiring manager who kinda ""got lost"" when I asked him again for another app to fill out. Told him I'll do it right now in the showroom and bring it back in about 15 minutes. Naturally, he was nowhere to be found and since I was still waiting for the recall to be done, I put the app right on his mouse on his desk and sat in the customers waiting area. I sat there for another hour and saw him once go into his office, and then dash out, not to be seen again! Left about ninety minutes later and he was just gone. Not that I'm surprised here.
Think I'm being discriminated here but just can't prove it. Think if I didn't have a cane that they'd have no issue. But truthfully, I do feel better using it and I do need it for balance issues. But I can drive with no problem. Hell, I've been at Hertz going on 6 years this January 13th and I show up when scheduled. I'd be a great employee if they'd just give me a chance. I know my bosses at Hertz would give me a good review because I'm a good employee. The travel time saved plus the unused petrol would be a lot plus no tolls would be needed to get there. Maybe if I put another app in, they'll get tired of seeing them and hire me!
As TJC78 said above, it really is a great car loving retirees gig. With Hertz, I get to drive many of the newest models which really is a blast. The VW store uses a minivan, the one which is really a Dodge Caravan underneath VW sold a few years back. Used to driving that size vehicle so no real learning curve. And I know the surrounding area pretty good and if not, have Siri on my iPhone to set me straight.
Maybe one day soon, G-d will decide that it's time for an employment change for me and get me something real close to home. And since I already own a VW product plus we have an Audi on the other half of my garage, we're all in the family! All they need is to call me to set up an interview!!"
4121	October 2, 2019 7:18PM	Sandman6472	Would also be curious as to how much you've saved on petrol since having the Volt? Don't see that many down here though more and more Bolt's are copping up. Many more hybrids out there which is probably a good way to get one's feet wet here. The more I see of the Hyundai Ioniq on the roads, the more I'm starting to like them. The Kia Nitto isn't that bad either and the extra versatility of the hatch is something I'm quite happy with. And the Hyundai store is right outside our development as is the VW and Subaru/Mitsubishi store among others. From what I've read, VW is looking at electric vehicles very closely now as an alternative to diesel. Think I might just be ready to start my search in this general direction going forward.
4122	October 2, 2019 7:29PM	xwesx	The Toyota CR-V. That's a rare bird!
4123	October 2, 2019 7:30PM	Michaell	"VW is not ""looking closely"" at EVs. VW is committing many billions of $$$'s to EV development, part of it as penance for the dieselgate situation a few years back.

First EV, a small hatch, has been pre-announced in Europe, and sold out pretty quickly. The first model for the US is - naturally - a small SUV, due in the next couple of years.

I recently read an article on the VW CEO who was telling the design teams that the cars they are developing now are likely the last for internal combustion engines for the company."
4124	October 2, 2019 7:56PM	qbrozen	So I wound up banging out the Equinox hub replacement in 90 mins. The amazon mechanic did me a favor after all. Spent 90 mins of my time to save $145. I’ll take that any day.
4125	October 2, 2019 8:16PM	stickguy	Get the rear diff error code fixed yet?
4126	October 2, 2019 9:14PM	suydam	In nearly 3 years, 70% Electric, 30% gas — mainly long trips as the Volt’s range is only 50 miles; after that it runs like any regular hybrid vehicle. I never use gas in town. I’m thinking if I could get an EV that would get me 100 miles and back, that would be the majority of driving we do. For the occasional longer trips we have the Encore as a backup gas vehicle. I still can’t count on charging at my destination. Hopefully that will be changing in the near future. And I live in a condo, so I can’t install a 240 v charger. But a regular outlet would work fine as long as I charged it after 50 miles use — which is what I do now. There is also a public fast charger nearby that I could use after a trip. I really like the Volt as a vehicle, though, so any EV has to be as least as good as that — nice interior, great handling and acceleration, compact size.
4127	October 2, 2019 11:55PM	corvette	@suydam sounds like an i3 lease would be perfect for you!
4128	October 3, 2019 12:57AM	qbrozen	Nope. I have a plan, just need the time to execute. I cut out one 14-pin plug and wired around it. Now have more errors, so I need to recheck those connections. I wasn’t getting the warm and fuzzies from the batch of connectors I bought, so I’ll replace those. Then cut out the other 10-pin connector under there. These are TSBs to replace.
4129	October 3, 2019 1:19AM	ab348	Not as rare as the Kia Nitto! I think you mean the Niro, Sandy. I like those too though I wish they had a bit more power.
4130	October 3, 2019 2:51AM	corvette	"Looking at the i3 - my ""litmus test"" for these things is how easy it would be for me to make my annual pilgrimage to Nebraska. It's now very doable with Tesla's Supercharger network and the extremely fast charging it offers.

DC quick charging stations have improved, but the i3 has a slower DC quick charge rate, and I'd still have to hack the electronics to enable the charge maintaining mode. In addition, I'd have to try to keep both the 2.4 gallon fuel tank and the battery topped off as much as possible. It could be fun, but it sounds more like the equivalent of paying $150 a night to go camping when there's a perfectly good Hampton Inn with hot showers, a fridge to store my booze, and free hot breakfast."
4131	October 3, 2019 2:59AM	Sandman6472	"Probably so, I always seem to get the names mixed up. But do enjoy driving all the different vehicles we have. Just miss the long distance driving I used to do, like to spend some time just driving the vehicles. A bit different now that the Sirius/XM is an option and not given freely. And customers are not to happy about that either!! Amusing because it's always been something we should of charged for in the first place and now that we are, folks are angry because their freebie is gone. It was nice of Hertz to do this little perk all these years and folks should be thankful it was there all this time.
The public just slays me. So many folks come in and a lot are just not truthful which is sad. Had one guy come in to our office, threw the keys down and rushed out of the office and left. Parked his rental away from the building. Turns out there was a lot of body damage but it couldn't be seen from the way he parked it. Only problem is he'll be charged for the damage he didn't own up to because he left his home and business phone number plus his c c is on file. So his little game didn't do him any good. Usually someone goes out, checks the vehicle over, and gets the miles and amount of fuel left in the vehicle. But his running and dumping of the keys never gave anyone a chance to get out there to see the vehicle. Not sure why he thought he'd get away with damaging a vehicle, and now he's just made his situation worse actually! My guess is he used his own insurance coverage and refused the extra Hertz coverage he could've gotten where he'd be able to just drop it off damaged and go since he got the company insurance. Just speculating on this but why else would he return it the way he did? My bosses aren't stupid like he's hoping...they'll see this damage and take appropriate action. That's why honesty is always the best policy!!"
4132	October 3, 2019 3:20AM	28firefighter	This is totally an around town car for us. The drive from Portland was 100% doable but not something I’d do regularly for the reasons you outlined.
4133	October 3, 2019 3:53AM	suydam	The i3 does not interest me. I don’t like the looks and it just isn’t what I want. I know folks here love them, but it just doesn’t float my boat.
4134	October 3, 2019 11:50AM	ab348	"It just happens that my local newspaper published this review of the Kia Niro all-electric this morning.

https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/wheels/2019-kia-niro-ev-is-an-electric-vehicle-at-the-top-of-its-class-358911/

It is a bit of a softball review but goes on at some length. The electric version does seem to address the lack of power the other versions experience. Overall it does seem like a viable alternative although the pricing is disappointing (note that the numbers are in our worthless Canadian $). I have heard the criticism about the harshness on bumpy roads in reviews of the other versions as well so I wonder why Kia has failed to address this."

And now I've just read that 2019 is going to be the last year for the VW Golf, a shame as I do like mine overall. Sure, the drivers door lock repair was just too expensive as far as I'm concerned and it just shouldn't of happened. Plus the water pump/thermostat problem before the basic warranty was even finished didn't install confidence but these things are made by machines and man, a combination with some problems going forward. But at the end of the day, I still enjoy driving it and will keep it as long as it behaves but once it starts having issues, it'll be gone very quickly. 59K is rapidly approaching and can see me breaking the 70K mark before the end of 2020.
4141	October 3, 2019 4:30PM	suydam	Did you drive the Niro EV or the hybrid? According to reviews driving dynamics are better in the EV version.
4142	October 3, 2019 5:57PM	breld	That is unbelievable! It's like Tony Stark levels of crazy engineering.
4143	October 3, 2019 7:27PM	Sandman6472	Drove the regular one at work and it drove just like any other Hyundai/Kia product to be honest. Reminds me of Toyota and Honda from many year ago. Good products at a decent price that most folks could afford.
4144	October 3, 2019 7:38PM	ab348	One thing I learned reading that Niro review was that the 2020 model year will bring a Kia Soul EV. I can see that doing well if pricing is not crazy.
4145	October 3, 2019 10:09PM	andres3	"My take from 3 years with a '16 Kia Optima is they age in dog years. At 3 years old, the Optima seemed old, tired, and weathered. That's my take and 2 cents. It was reliable, but for how long past 3 years?

Unlike my A4, where new tires made it seem like new again, new tires didn't help the Kia much."
4146	October 3, 2019 10:25PM	28firefighter	How long past 3 years? My guess is well longer than you would expect. That it isn't something you enjoy driving or looking at is an entirely different issue having nothing to do with reliability.
4147	October 3, 2019 10:55PM	corvette	@ab348 I thought there already was a Soul EV?
4148	October 3, 2019 11:05PM	28firefighter	There was - I think the last year for the previous generation was 2018 - was on the slower side and had about 80-90 miles of range. My BIL has one and @tifighter used to have one. The new 2020 is supposed to have 200+ miles of range.
4149	October 3, 2019 11:12PM	stickguy	I had a 2015 Sonata for 3 years (lease). Dead reliable, and still looked, drove and smelled like new when I gave it back.
4150	October 3, 2019 11:26PM	tjc78	"Yeah even my Elantra at three (fairly hard) years old still looks and drives as good as it ever did.

Dropping that off Tuesday night. Kinda liked having a third car for a couple months. I’ll like getting it off my insurance though!"
4151	October 3, 2019 11:57PM	andres3	"Maybe. Things like noise, exterior noise entering the cabin, and excessive drivetrain noises seemed to creep up with age too fast, including possibly some rattles/vibrations here and there. The performance seemed to taper off a bit, like it was tired of drinking 87 octane.

It might run, but it'll be hell to live in it for 10 years."
4152	October 3, 2019 11:59PM	andres3	Make sure not to take pictures of how many Key FOB's you leave behind.
4153	October 4, 2019 12:24AM	sda	Wow, I admire your patience and skill. I think at this point I’d say nuts to it. Yet I’ve been known to persevere.
4154	October 4, 2019 1:05AM	Sandman6472	"But they are ""cheap to keep"" and sometimes, that's not a bad thing. I don't like auto drama personally, I want my vehicle to always start and never break down. With certain makes and models, one can achieve that goal...with others, not so much. But I like to know that before going in like I kinda did with my Golf. And now, have done it and going forward, looking for ""cheap to keep"" again but either a hybrid or electric but, need to find the right combo that fits into my life and not the other way around. But at this quiet stage of ownership, just enjoying the ride so to speak, as I'm not quite motivated to spend some serious cash on something new. Need to get my short list in order and then start the test driving process. Usually am up for the chase, but not quite there.
Hoping to find 0% financing when the time comes among my small list of requirements. Since I just sprang for new Eagle GT's, need to get some use out of them. Four wheel alignment policy has a little over a week to go before I'm done so getting it done next week.. Once the 2020 models come out, I can slowly start the process and see where I land. Might be I even wait till 2021 but that's the million dollar question, where am I going to find another vehicle that makes me smile every time I see it and drive it? Thems big shoes to fill!"
4155	October 4, 2019 1:27AM	sda	How many miles did you get from the Bridgestone runflats? Last I recall you were satisfied with them and they were not near needing replacement. By the way, while I prefer Michelin, I have had good experience with Good Year.
4156	October 4, 2019 2:21AM	stickguy	Sandy, your Golf is probably at the sweet spot where it depreciated quite a bit, to where trading it might make you feel pain, but in the next 1-2 years will really go down relatively little. so the best time to just ride it out.
4157	October 4, 2019 2:48AM	kyfdx	"Walked by a car that could be my winter beater, today.

Subaru Legacy Outback
I think it’s a ‘98 or ‘99, but the sign didn’t say.

What it did say:
Runs
Cold A/C
244K miles
$700

White w/gray cladding.
Looks like a lower mile example (say, 225K)

Possible deal killer: automatic

Big plus: hood scoop!

Anyone think that could get me 500 miles/month?"
4158	October 4, 2019 2:50AM	stickguy	"it made that many. good odds it can handle another 5 months. For that price, you could sell some parts off of it and turn a profit. And for a winter beater for that few miles, an AT really should not matter.

a normally running car for $700, that isn't rusted out? Grab it, even if you just want to clean it up and flip it."
4159	October 4, 2019 2:53AM	tifighter	The Soul EV was good for what it was intended for - a city runabout. It felt solid enough at lease end. And because the range was short, there was never any question about its usage. The 2020 model, with the extended range, ironically brings more scrutiny because the extended range highlights the holes in the available charger coverage for it. Roll you eyes all you guys want over my like of Tesla, but they were early in getting the infrastructure out, and that helps make their cars a stronger all-usage proposition. IMHO, of course
4160	October 4, 2019 3:16AM	28firefighter	At $700 I guarantee that headgasket is blown away. Note, the ad didn’t say “runs well.”
4161	October 4, 2019 3:31AM	roadburner	"The i3 is RWD, which is a major plus for me. The only downside is the possibility of being mistaken for a tree-hugger. Maybe a bumper sticker along the lines of ""My Other Cars have a Carbon Footprint the Size of Texas"" would help."
4162	October 4, 2019 3:58AM	28firefighter	The handling of the i3 is almost comical it’s so fun. You do not expect it to drive the way it does.
4163	October 4, 2019 6:58AM	xwesx	Really depends on whether it is suffering head gasket issues. There are some tell tale signs of that, so if you know what you're looking for in that regard, it's almost hard to go wrong at that price.
4164	October 4, 2019 9:18AM	Sandman6472	"I was down to around 3/32's on all four corners and Goodyear had this incredible deal where I bought four and got $60 off at installation plus another $100 Visa gift card one needed to mail in or do it online. Getting $160 off made it a very compelling offer when I was thinking about doing it. It was supposed to be $25 off at installation but the day I had them installed, that rebate went up by $40. So I got an even better deal than originally thought. Think I could've gone another 6 months or so but figured why not, since I might just enjoy the car more with better rubber. Do feel a difference in ride and braking and would've gotten run flats again if they were part of the deal. The sales guy had these same Goodyear Eagle GT's on his own vehicle and seemed to like them. I was going for a different tire when I walked in there the fist time but he convinced me to get what I got.
Got them over at the Goodyear store where I was stationed at the time but that afternoon, I was told I'm to report to my old office my next work day. First time I've ever bought tires from a Goodyear store as we usually use Tires Plus as they have so many more locations down here.
But did like the run flats and like these new ones to. Just as long as I always have air in them, I'm happy!"
4165	October 4, 2019 11:58AM	tjc78	"I haven't replaced a set of tires since my 2006 Avalon. That was a 3/36 lease but the OEM Bridgestones were shot by 21K. I put Goodyear Eagle GTs on that wore OK but really hurt the ride of that car.

For me there is only one tire I'll buy. Michelin. So happy both my cars have them."
4166	October 4, 2019 5:16PM	28firefighter	We had to replace the tires on the X1 earlier this year - made it about 23k miles on the OEM Pirelli RFTs before they were down to 3/32 front and 4/32 rear. Really not impressive performance at all.
4167	October 4, 2019 5:21PM	corvette	@Sandman6472 How many miles did you get out of the Bridgestones?
4168	October 4, 2019 6:18PM	kyfdx	We picked up a nail with about 28K on the X3. Unrepairable. We were about 70%-80% worn, so I just got a set. Old ones were Goodyears, new ones are Pirellis.
4169	October 4, 2019 7:07PM	cdnpinhead	I got 54K satisfactory miles out of a set of Continental Control Contact Plus tires, so went ahead and put them on again on the TSX.
4170	October 4, 2019 7:12PM	stickguy	"I liked Continentals the few times I had them.

one of the only brands I ever had that wore out really prematurely was Michelin's. totally toast on my Odyssey by 30k, the replacements (Yokos I think) were still deep tread at about 75K when I sold it.

RDX Michelins made it to about 42K before they got replaced."
4171	October 4, 2019 7:42PM	tjc78	I had 50K on the Michelin Symmetry's on my 04 MGM. I'd wager they would have gone easily another 10, maybe more.
4172	October 4, 2019 8:08PM	ab348	Lots of variation in rubber compounds used greatly affects tire wear. I had a set of Michelin x-Ice2 winters for my 2011 Regal that were pretty much done after 3 winters and maybe 15000 miles - due to the rubber compound they used on those. Conversely I bought a set of Michelin Defenders to replace the OE Goodyear Eagles on my '02 Intrigue which were pretty used up at 30000 miles and those Michelins wore like iron. Performance tires often do not last very long due to a sticky rubber compound. The Bridgestone performance run-flats used on my ATS are reported to last only 10-15000 miles.
4173	October 4, 2019 8:35PM	xwesx	"Speaking of X-Ice, I felt that my XI3 wore very quickly on my wife's Forester over the three winters we used them. About 15,000 miles, she felt they were not performing as well by the end of last winter, so I resolved to replace them. They were slightly over 8/32"".

Since I had a bit of a tire replacement backup this summer (van, Q7, and Forester all needed their all-seasons replaced), I decided to defer costs a bit. I bought new rubber for the van, figured I could run the Q7 part of the summer on the old tires, and just ran the XI3 through the summer on the wife's car with the plan to put new winter tires on her stock 17"" rims (previously used for the summer tread) come September.

Things went a little crazy though, because I didn't replace the Q7 tires at all, ended up buying a new set of tires for that Focus I bought for a friend of mine, and the XI3 tires are still at 8/32"" tread after a summer of use! I was amazed by that. So, now I'm just going to use them next summer as well. The Q7 didn't see much use this summer due to much biking and use of the Focus/Forester that my friend has/had. The summer tires are totally shot now (2/32"" to 3/32"" depth), so that will be first on the list of expenses next spring.

I put Yokohama IceGuard iG51v on my wife's car for her new winter rubber. 215/60R17 size, the smallest available in that tire. I am very happy with the performance on my Q7.... used for three winters now and still at 10/32"" tread. Great snow traction, solid ice traction, and exceptional longevity."
4174	October 4, 2019 8:38PM	xwesx	"Milestone:



I wasn't watching mileage, so this one caught me off guard and I just quickly snapped the shot in motion so that I didn't risk missing the even oughts."
4175	October 4, 2019 8:45PM	tjc78	Nice! Chilly day up there! (Well, I'm sure not for you)
4176	October 4, 2019 9:04PM	xwesx	yeah, the weather isn't too bad on the temperature front. It is raining heavily though, which is unusual. Should be snow.
4177	October 4, 2019 10:58PM	corvette	Sometimes the rubber compound just gets harder due to age, weather, temperature cycles, and/or bad design, causing poor traction even if there’s plenty of tread. That happened with the Yokohama tires that were on my G37, which were not even that old in terms of age.
4178	October 5, 2019 12:41AM	breld	"At $15k off, I am finding this incredibly tempting. Still a lot of money though.

4179	October 5, 2019 1:00AM	tjc78	Nice! C’mon I can’t be the only Volvo owner on CCBA!
4180	October 5, 2019 1:11AM	nyccarguy	Looks like the $15K off is a leasing incentive according to their website
4181	October 5, 2019 1:21AM	Sandman6472	"Think I got around 35K on the Bridgestone run flats. Probably could've gotten another 5K or so miles but when I found out about the rebate on the Goodyears, decided to just have them swapped out. And at first as looking at a different tire, were the Assurance All Season ones. But my sales guy said these were better tires and had a bigger rebate at the time. Figured he knew his stuff so took his advice. The other sales person overheard the conversation and said he also got the Eagle GT's for his vehicle and really liked them. They had a Kelly brand tire I was also looking at but they told me not to even bother, guess it's their lower brand tire for folks who want as cheap as possible. Tires Plus also has their economy tire, some sort of Primewell tire that my guy always told me to look at Bridgestone, so I listened.
Since it's not something one buys that often, figured I'd get something good to last me until I end up in something else. Getting the alignment checked on Tuesday morning and am betting they'll come back telling me it's out again. Had it done about 2 weeks ago, and it runs out on 10/19/19, so giving them another wack at it. We'll see in a few months if I'll buy another 3 year policy as it's transferable to another vehicle only once."
4182	October 5, 2019 1:22AM	stickguy	"that is an expensive wagon. even with the discount. Nice looking, though way too dark inside.

And doesn't JPP still have a C30? That was him, right? Or did he never get a replacement for the rotted out one?"
4183	October 5, 2019 1:26AM	breld	"Now I see that - not that I'd be opposed to leasing it.

Funny - I asked the salesperson exactly that question and he didn't know."
4184	October 5, 2019 1:26AM	breld	Yes, JPP has his C30 as a companion to the Tacoma.
4185	October 5, 2019 1:32AM	Sandman6472	"Spoke with an owner of a Hyundai Ioniq today and he was quite happy with it overall. Getting about 45 mpg which isn't really bad. Once one gets over the weird looks of it, think it could be a very good vehicle. Will need to try one a few times before I make an informed decision. And with my next search, think I'll need multiple test drives of my short list, honestly. It won't be as easy as with the Golf. I really wasn't in the market then, wink wink, but after the first test drive, I was hooked. Decided to think it over because I had only owned it about 367 or so days. A week after the first test drive, went back, it was now my 3rd time at the VW store, and once they accepted Carmax's trade-in offer, did I make the deal. That second test drive really won me over. They had already agreed to swap out those awful stock alloys for ones from a different model. So once, they agreed to the extra that Carmax gave me, we shook on it and made the deal.
Also helped that we had gotten the A3 a week earlier and I had driven it a few times. Kind of cemented the deal in my head but hated to trade-in the Tucson so early. After some long soul searching, decided that illogical as it was, getting the Golf was a good thing and moved on and never have really looked back as it was, and still is, the right decision."
4186	October 5, 2019 2:00AM	stickguy	Unless it is an emergency (replacing a wreck or some such) I don't understand why people don't spend more time test driving before deciding. Avoid a lot of mistakes that way, and besides, it is a whole lotta fun!
4187	October 5, 2019 2:20AM	Michaell	I see lots of folks shopping for numbers rather than a car. And, lots of folks pick cars based on the deal, only to regret it later.
4188	October 5, 2019 2:53AM	28firefighter	I feel like you’re talking directly to me.
4189	October 5, 2019 3:25AM	nyccarguy	"The vehicles I’ve bought because I really wanted them and liked them on their merits have been the ones I’ve generally been the happiest with rather than the ones I’ve bought/leased at a price point.

My Saab, Prelude, 328xi, & Infiniti. My wife’s X3, and 2 Pilots."
4190	October 5, 2019 3:39AM	stickguy	"you need to at least come up with a list of options you like. once you have narrowed it down to acceptable choices, then pick by deal if you want.

Right now I have a ""short"" list of 5 CUVs. some different flavors, but pretty much comparable. I could be happy with any of them, so buying on price (especially if was going to lease) would be fine."
4191	October 5, 2019 3:47AM	Michaell	"The advice I give to the public at large wouldn't apply to this group, simply based on the volume of transactions we execute.

You'd be surprised at what people cross shop."

4193	October 5, 2019 5:22AM	nyccarguy	I see you guys every now and again tell someone that there is no possible way they are cross shopping every single permutation of Kia Stinger & Toyota Tacoma at the same time.
4194	October 5, 2019 5:42AM	Michaell	"Um, yeah.

And, we have no problem asking folks to refine their requests, if they are too broad."

Still in the hunt

Any auction values for 2018 Audi Q7 prestige 3.0 with 7k miles?"
4204	October 5, 2019 9:06PM	stickguy	"Got roped into taking ""the girls"" out winter coat shopping (and in a shocking twist, the wife actually found a winter and fall coat she liked at Lands end). The price was I got to stop at a couple dealers that we were going past. Just a brief attempt at a complaint, but did not last long! No drives, just some showroom sitting.

Got to see a Tiguan finally. Loaded SEL premium. MSRP over $39K. Ouch. Very nice, but failed the front seat comfort test. I found the cushion too short, and not enough tilt to make up for it. But the wife rejected it outright because the bolsters were too tight for her. So, that is out. Our daughter though loved it, and mentioned wanting to trade the Jetta for one once she gets a new job closer to home (next spring hopefully).

The main stop was Subaru. Conveniently, they had a nice limited XT sitting in the showroom. Cinnamon pearl. I really liked the color. She didn't. But good news, she liked the car OK (style) and really found the interior nice. I was impressed. Would be even better to be able to turn the giant iPad screen on! But the style, materials, and feature content was top notch. Great seats too, and I was hooked by the thigh extender. Out was perfect for me, in was perfect for the wife. big selling point. Lots of cargo room too, and back seat was huge. Had plenty of gadgets, including heated steering wheel and rear seats.

so, I think she might have been expecting to dismiss out of hand, but instead was agreeable to go back at some point to try one. The kid seems to think it is a long shot, but will have to see how the wife likes driving it, and using the tech. I would have her drive that back to back with an RDX to compare.

if it drives as nice as the 3.6 I drove last year, I could be sold!"
4205	October 5, 2019 10:56PM	laurasdada	"The boy who cried, ""punch:"" After work yesterday, drove to local Mazda dealer to look at a 2010 Mazda 3 Sport hatchback; Gun Metal Blue over black. ~86k miles It had been waxed, but a lot of residue left, making it look more scratched than I think it is, it'll have to be washed. Alloys somewhat road rashed, but Conti Extreme Contact DWS 06 tires with good tread; nice.

Sales dude introduced himself, non-commission, transparent, family owned dealership; high-volume turnover, gave me a bottle of water. Asked would I be trading the Jag, I said possibly for the 3 and a big bag of cash.... That I was looking for a second car, actually for my son the college junior. He asked did I want a test drive, at first I said, no, not in this miserable traffic, but he had a route... So:

Wow, how much fun that drive was! Car felt feather light, turned when I asked it too and did not stray from its line. 2.5 liter 4, nice get up and go, must be a nice power to weight ratio. Comfy cloth driver seat, seat cushion not too short. Everything I played with seemed to work. And, with windows up and radio off, road noise/wind wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. Asked for a crap road, which was on the tour, suspension well handled the craters. Wonder how the thing felt new!

Tomorrow the boy and I will go together, hopefully out before kickoff of the Pats game. Currently dealer is asking $7991, with two keys. But, $495 doc fee, 6.25% MA tax and $135 to title and register (and who knows if they'll try for other scam fees, VIN etching is only $200? I'll take two!). If we decide to throw an offer, I'm going to try for OTD $8k max, but would really see if I can push for $7500 OTD. So, any thoughts here?

If this one doesn't work, there are more to be had, significantly more sedans than HBs. If not a 3, I'm also going to look at '10-'12 Ford Fusions, Hyundai Sonatas, Subies (but expensive here in New England). He ""needs"" a car by EOM as his ride to/from work ends before Halloween.

Of course, he's a bit mad at me for not giving him the XF...

Keeping the ex informed as she'll be paying half, she asked can't you find something safe and reliable with closer to 50k miles for under $10k? Sure, a car that enjoyed some time hanging out with Katrina..."
4206	October 5, 2019 11:02PM	laurasdada	"Oh, yeah. After drive, there was a father/daughter looking at a black VW Golf Wagon/All track; 126k miles. I almost asked if he had a large net worth, joked about the 2 for 1 sale. He said great, we'll go 50/50 but I told him not my plan, he buys I get free. He smiled.

Daughter hops into the 3; I look at her and sternly say, ""Get out of my car!"" Sales dude called me this am, 3 is still available, hope other dad/daughter look elsewhere! Or, buy the VDub, they're customers of my dude, too."

4211	October 6, 2019 4:07AM	suydam	Put some gas in the Volt since we are going out of town tomorrow. Cost $13 and that’s in California where gas is now over $4 a gallon. First time we’ve put gas in it in 3 months.
4212	October 6, 2019 6:07AM	Sandman6472	"Have driven a few 4Runners at work and I always enjoy them. Sit a bit higher and just a fun rig to drive. Was a bit busy at work today as one guy called out, so started early and worked late but since it was Saturday, no big deal. A few customers were a bit assholic about waiting so long but there's a whole procedure the agents must go through, not really their choice. Found that many folks want an upgrade for nothing and aren't very fair when it comes to a survey which kinda stinks! So glad I don't have to deal with those folks because I'd have trouble holding my tongue as people lie so easily! Sometimes I just walk away when I hear some folks.
The Sirius/XM free upgrade has ended and folks are still bitching about it. Most won't pay for it but have had no issue getting it for free all these years. Must admit, I miss it to but just carry a lightning cord with me now and use my iPhone to listen to my tunes that way. It's still free on certain brand new vehicles for the first 3 months. Figure that my library has now 882 tunes in it and since I always shuffle them, never know what's coming up next."

Also any idea of auction value for low mile (6k) premium plus 3.0 Audi Q7?

I see both 18 and 19 CPO Premium plus and prestige and am wondering what the auction delta in price is.

Thanks"
4214	October 6, 2019 11:39AM	qbrozen	About $52k
4215	October 6, 2019 11:46AM	qbrozen	$44k vs $51k. Very big difference for some reason
4216	October 6, 2019 11:57AM	mjfloyd1	"Thanks.

Wow 7k more for prestige vs premium plus - I assume both 2018s?

I thought you had said $49k for 19 prestige 3.0 with 7500 miles when I initially asked? Maybe I’m not remembering correctly??"
4217	October 6, 2019 12:12PM	mjfloyd1	Local family owned tire shop. Really good guys. Representative from Michelin called me and it was really odd. She made an offer of 90% of wholesale value. I did not realize that it was bartering and said it was fine. She asked if I realized that I could ask for more and we settled at 95%.
4218	October 6, 2019 12:43PM	mjfloyd1	This is what I recalled. Maybe that was for the 4 cylinder??
4219	October 6, 2019 12:50PM	kyfdx	I think the Prestige only comes with the 3.0 engine.
4220	October 6, 2019 1:44PM	mjfloyd1	Ahh maybe premium plus 2019 then??
4221	October 6, 2019 2:25PM	qbrozen	Ok, had to backtrack. Those numbers are all correct; HOWEVER, upon closer inspection, most of the 2019 Prestige examples have very poor condition reports. Odd but true. So not an accurate assessment for a clean one. Probably more like $54k-$55k for a clean low-mileage 2019 Prestige. Maybe. Possibly. Not enough examples to make a totally fair estimate.
4222	October 6, 2019 2:27PM	qbrozen	"Oh, and that 44 vs 51 was for 18 vs 19 PP v6.

The ‘18 PP is the obvious bargain of these 4 choices. No clue why it is so much lower than the others, but it is what it is."
4223	October 6, 2019 2:33PM	corvette	Interesting! Glad they took care of you. I think European makes tend to wear out tires faster due to heavier curb weight and also their alignment settings, which are usually tuned to prioritize road feel and making the car feel planted vs. making the tires last as long as possible.
4224	October 6, 2019 3:00PM	mjfloyd1	"Thank you.

I do see a CPO 18 prestige with 6.5k miles for 53k

Only reasonable priced 18 PP is 5k miles for 50k non CPO (I think)"
4225	October 6, 2019 5:48PM	28firefighter	Put the Viggen up for sale today. It depresses me to do it, but I found out my parking arrangement is going to be going away and doing car Tetris isn’t going to fly at home. If I can’t get a minimum number, I’ll keep it and work to find somewhere to store it, but first attempt will be sale.

4230	October 6, 2019 7:55PM	stickguy	seems like something that might work for BaT?

4234	October 6, 2019 9:57PM	stickguy	"I did read the ad after I posted that. But, they do have some listings that are like that. If nothing else, gives them some lower cost units to list. Plus it certainly qualifies as a unique piece!

I suppose you won't know unless you submit it to them."

4237	October 7, 2019 2:12AM	corvette	Good luck with the sale, @28firefighter ! Sorry you lost your storage space and it sounds like the time with the Viggen came to an end before you were ready.
4238	October 7, 2019 2:17AM	stickguy	it was a good run. you have the memories, and at some point, will be ready to hunt for the next oddball toy!
4239	October 7, 2019 2:29AM	jpp75	I just told @Michaell and @breld that I'd buy it if I didn't have the C30.

4249	October 7, 2019 1:56PM	marcogallo1986	@ Sandman, I’m glad your job is getting a loan of 2020 models in, and you enjoy driving so much. It’s one job I wish I could do I’d be in heaven ha ha Ha. People are crazy and a lot more honest unfortunately the things they do with rental cars and just every day life sad sad sad. On the discrimination that’s hard to prove even with me I’ve been applying for jobs I dealers free ever not gonna give up it’s a dream of mine. But keep at it God has a plan for us all.
4250	October 7, 2019 1:57PM	marcogallo1986	@ondrays 3 every car brand has its problems, I mention this over and over and here, I mean you’re entitled to your opinion on the Kia which is fine. I know you like your Audi’s which is perfectly fine too. Different strokes for different folks.

And get out in the car again a bit next weekend. Not sure if I told everyone, got a new battery for last Tuesday and they ended up giving me one for free even though the old one they probably weren’t going to cover under warranty thank God worked out in my favor.
4253	October 7, 2019 2:13PM	marcogallo1986	@ 28 fire fighter, sorry to hear the sad sad news they have to sell Division, but I’m sure eventually you’ll find another toy, I’m glad you’re getting lots of interest on it.

4255	October 7, 2019 2:19PM	28firefighter	No not tightwads at all, I don't think. Actually the feedback I've gotten is that I'm being very reasonable and honest in my ad. The people interested right now are really enthusiasts - asking about common modifications, failure points, etc - they know what this car is relative to the average consumer.

4257	October 7, 2019 2:22PM	marcogallo1986	Agreed people should do more looking at the cars that they like not just numbers. I guess my neighbor they gonna go this coming weekend since their lease is up a week from tomorrow and they haven’t done a damn thing yet I gave up on trying to talk to them about it they’re going to see I’m sure going to hear all about it how stressed out they are because they waited to the last minute meanwhile I told him from the beginning of September let’s go look.
4258	October 7, 2019 2:23PM	marcogallo1986	So not gonna be able to lease a Mustang GT, turns out for doesn’t lease them only the cohost one that’s with three or four dealers told me this past week since I last checked in here last Tuesday.

4270	October 7, 2019 8:47PM	tjc78	You posted a V8, I'd wager it would edge out the Charger.
4271	October 7, 2019 8:50PM	stickguy	not sure which trips the lights first, but I know the Porsche will keep going longer. and most likely, you won't get scared off as soon!
4272	October 8, 2019 2:33AM	qbrozen	"Hell, the Panamera V6 can give my R/T a very tight race.

But I ain’t gettin a Panamera for $10k, so the Charger easily wins the value column."
4273	October 8, 2019 2:47AM	stickguy	plus, you can take the Charger to Jiffy Lube if you feel like it!
4274	October 8, 2019 2:53AM	nyccarguy	That makes a big deal in all seriousness. I’ve said this before, but my parents SUVs each cost around the same amount of money. Dad’s Yukon gets the oil change/tire rotation for $70 or $80 with coupon. $70-$80 at the Porsche service department gets you a tissue when you sneeze.
4275	October 8, 2019 3:04AM	stickguy	"if we decide to splurge and max out the budget on something nice, that is why it won't be a Porsche (especially since that would have to be a used one). I assume a base Macan costs just as much to maintain as a ""real"" porsche does.

I suppose the cheap cousin Q5 would be a reasonable alternative, if you got the right trim level!"

Called last night to make a 5:30 appointment to drop it off. Woman on the phone asked if I was buying another Hyundai. I said ""no"", she then said ""well we prefer you do this during the day, but if that's the only time you have that's cool with us""

HMM... look up my file lady. I've bought 5 cars since 2009 with your dealer group. Oh and sidebar, most likely a sixth next fall (Enclave #3).

Anyway... looking over the last three years with the Elantra. For $210 / month with $250 OOP I can't say a bad thing about it. Cheap transportation through the crazy expensive child care years.

Car didn't have a single thing go wrong. The tech worked great, good AC/Heat, and heated seats you could cook an egg on. Zero rattles after three years and drives just like it did when it was new. I was pretty hard on the little guy and it never got under 29 MPG.

All in all a very pleasant ownership experience and I'd recommend one to anyone."
4279	October 8, 2019 12:41PM	nyccarguy	"Always good to hear about a pleasant ownership (leasorship) experience. While you didn't gush over the driving experience, it served you very well for the last 3 years. You & @stickguy seemed to have liked the value aspect. Very hard to argue with $210 per month for a brand spankin new car.

I always tell people there are deals like this out there if you are willing to work hard and negotiate. Every time I hear someone say they are ""lookin for a cheap car"" with a budget of less than $10K, I suggest leasing an Elantra, Civic, or Corolla. The excuse is always ""I don't want to have payments."" $210 per month comes out to a little over $7,500 for 3 years. So yes, you can plunk down $7-$10K on a good used car that you can drive ""payment free"" for the next 3 years. That used car is still going to depreciate, need maintenance, repairs, tires, brakes..."
4280	October 8, 2019 12:42PM	stickguy	"And a great buy as a slightly used car.

The next (current) generation to yours is even better all around too."
4281	October 8, 2019 1:55PM	corvette	$39 Groupon for two oil changes (within a year) at my locally owned shop. I need to take the Tahoe in there soon, as I think the one year is almost up. Free tire rotations at Discount Tire.
4282	October 8, 2019 2:00PM	pensfan83	The Prelude goes in Thursday for its annual state inspection. Only driven 2,300 miles since last year so it'll be exempt from emissions and shouldn't need much else hopefully.
4283	October 8, 2019 2:06PM	28firefighter	"An absolutely great value, @tjc78 and it served it's purpose well.

As far as the lease return, it is interesting to hear that. I think Hyundai is like some other brands where accepting a lease return is not mandatory unless it is the dealer you originally leased from. I've heard horror stories of CJDR dealers being unwilling to ground returns. Sounds like they're annoyed but the lease return should take them 5 minutes - maybe you could even test drive something to make them feel better about it."
4284	October 8, 2019 2:24PM	stickguy	"I took mine back to the dealer TJC is talking about. I just showed up, no appointment. Took 5-10 minutes, no fuss. I did call prior to ask about logistics, and they told me to just bring it by whenever I felt like it.

Was not the dealer I bought it from. Wasn’t even the local guy I used for service!"
4285	October 8, 2019 2:29PM	28firefighter	That's great! A pleasant surprise.
4286	October 8, 2019 5:26PM	tjc78	"I don't suspect any problems, I think I just got a cranky person on the phone.

I could certainly understand if you came in on a Saturday afternoon, but anytime during a week day shouldn't be an issue!

@28firefighter
Yes, it did serve it's purpose well."
4287	October 8, 2019 5:56PM	28firefighter	"The X1 is going to BMW on Friday for it's pre-return inspection. I'm not expecting anything but you never know.

Interestingly, BMWFS did warn me that the dealer could put up a stink about accepting the return because only the originating center has to take it. It would be a huge bummer if I had to drive this thing down to Portland."
4288	October 8, 2019 5:58PM	corvette	"Good news: Water pipe noise seems to have disappeared on its own. I still plan to improve the way it’s attached to the joists in hopes of eliminating future issues.

Bad news: the Tahoe radio was popping something awful this afternoon, and as I pulled into the parking lot at work, it lost power briefly and a bunch of warning lights came on. Then, everything went back to normal before I could even see which lights illuminated. Going to check the battery connections when I get home, but if there’s nothing obvious there, it will probably be a mechanic visit."
4289	October 8, 2019 6:07PM	xwesx	That seems ridiculous! What, do they expect people to just remain tethered in one place for three years? I would say, if they don't want to take it, that's fine. You can just leave it in the lot with the keys inside. Your lease period is done; it is their problem now!
4290	October 8, 2019 6:22PM	tjc78	"Best lease return ever was my 2006 Avalon. The bank came and picked it up at my job!

I'm sure I've told this before but someone came running into my office thinking it was being re-possessed or stolen. LOL."
4291	October 8, 2019 7:51PM	pensfan83	I suspect it could also have to do with whether space is available on the main or overflow lot.
4292	October 8, 2019 8:22PM	ab348	Could be worse... it could have been like the lease on my 2011 Regal where the leasing dealer had no record of the car at all. I even had the title which is something they were supposed to have kept. I never made the connection as it was just stuck in a file with all the other paperwork from the time of the acquisition. In retrospect I should have just kept my mouth shut until they finally called. I suspect GM Financial or whoever wrote the lease would have eventually rattled their chain.
4293	October 8, 2019 8:38PM	28firefighter	"This, I believe, is the underlying issue. Also, BMW dealers have to buy a certain number or percentage of lease returns to resell as CPO units or otherwise use one of a limited number of ""passes"" to reject a car and ship it to auction, so this might have something to do with it. Though I did just read somewhere that a BMW lease returned to the non-originating dealer can be rejected without using one of their ""passes"" - maybe @roadburner can confirm?"
4294	October 8, 2019 8:43PM	stickguy	That sounds like a BMWFS issue, that should not be of any concern to the customer
4295	October 8, 2019 8:46PM	28firefighter	To most people no. But I like to understand the drivers behind these things since I tend to operate on the fringe of what most dealers would consider friendly to their bottom line.
4296	October 8, 2019 10:02PM	nyccarguy	"Ok good news. My wife found a 2nd job working at a hospital that is about a 25 minute drive from our house. She will see homecare patients a few days per week and then work at this new hospital a few days a week.

She did get a flat tire today on her way for some pre employment testing (W2, drug testing...). With 33K miles on the (rather expensive) OEM Continentals, do I go ahead and replace all four?"
4297	October 8, 2019 10:04PM	kyfdx	Depends on how worn they are.
4298	October 8, 2019 10:04PM	xwesx	"If the flat requires replacement, then you are likely into the mileage where the tread difference will cause stress in the AWD system. If these are OEM tires, they are probably 2/3 or better through their usable life anyway.

Short answer: Yes, you should probably plan on replacement of the set."
4299	October 8, 2019 10:20PM	28firefighter	"Congrats to your wife, @nyccarguy. Very happy to hear she is landing back on her feet.

Regarding the tires, my guess is you can't possibly have more than 3-4/32 remaining on them all around. You're into the point of replacing all 4 if they cannot repair."
4300	October 8, 2019 10:37PM	stickguy	agreed about tires. Hopefully it can be plugged.
4301	October 8, 2019 10:38PM	corvette	Update: it looks like the negative battery cable on the Tahoe is corroded, but that may or may not be the only issue. Bad grounds and a bad main fuse also seem to be common problems on the GMT900. I’m going to call my local shop tomorrow to see whether that’s something they can check out.
4302	October 8, 2019 11:20PM	sda	I’m getting ready to find out...hoping for the best.
4303	October 8, 2019 11:20PM	tjc78	"So the Elantra is gone ... but not without drama.

They “grounded” it with the wrong miles. 8408 instead of 18408.

I refused to sign the paperwork until it’s corrected. Apparently this is kind of a process as Hyundai has to undo the return and reprocess.

They told me it doesn’t matter... yeah sure.

I have all the paperwork and it appears that the dealer is buying the car anyway as they put their plate frames on it and the warranty sticker on the window.

Guy handling the return said they love clean low mileage returns like this."
4304	October 8, 2019 11:22PM	marcogallo1986	@new York car guy. Nice on the wife finding an arcane job! Very happy for her!!! And yes I would replace. Those. Tires. I’m the pilot but don’t get the OEM ones get some other brand of your choosing.
4305	October 8, 2019 11:22PM	marcogallo1986	@tJC that’s funny on the lease return of your 2006 Toyota Avalon, and the bank came to get it at your job, and someone thought it was getting repossessed. Lol
4306	October 8, 2019 11:23PM	tjc78	"Great news on the job front.

I’d probably be looking at a set or at least two matching Continentals."
4307	October 8, 2019 11:24PM	marcogallo1986	@ everyone above talking about the Hyundai lease returns, or my mom returned her 2003 Santa Fe, they came and got it from the house with our truck.

The flat isn’t fixable. A nice gash in the sidewalk from hitting a pothole or road imperfection “just right.” I’ll measure the tread depth, but I’m going to go with the assumption that the tires are at least 2/3rds towards the end of their usable life. With winter approaching and my wife using it more, I’m going to look into replacing all four."

And, while I may not be chronic, I am (finally) a car buyer! Tonight, I became the proud owner of a 2010 Mazda 3s Sport hatchback. Bought from a long standing, family owned Mazda dealer, single owner, very well serviced car.
Will actually be registered in my son's name, he will now have a crash course on real world finance as he'll be paying for insurance, gas and maintenance. Poor soul.

Watch out breld, the pump is primed!"
4313	October 9, 2019 2:04AM	fintail	Speaking of Hyundais, my cousin buys a late model Santa Fe every several years or so, miles it up, and gets another. 60-something year old woman, maintains it by the book, mostly highway miles, yada yada. Her current one is a 14 (I think) - at 135K miles, the engine decided to call it quits. She had some kind of warranty that expired at 120K - dealer decided to replace the engine anyway. I'm quite surprised.

Of course, getting a hold of the boy to finalize the sale (register in his name & insurance) is like trying to wrangle sheep; ""Saturday's no good dad, I'm going to U New Hampster to visit a friend..."" Dude, we just bought you a car! Friend must be a girl..."

Don't want to work full time anymore, don't have to which is nice, but since they need another body, just said yes. The extra income won't hurt and it's a real nice drive across Alligator Alley/I-75. Rained 90% of the trip back yesterday but the 2018 Kia Forte held the wet roads pretty nicely. And my iTunes worked flawlessly, so all was good. Was supposed to get a Chevy Camaro but traded for the smaller Forte. And since the Camaro was no where to be fond, they substituted a Chevy Equonix. Not as sporty as the Camaro but a nice driver to begin with. We also have a lot of GMC Acadia's in the fleet which is basically the same vehicle.

I told them I could see corrosion on the negative cable, but didn't know whether it was bad enough to cause a problem. I told them to go ahead and change the oil (using the second and final one from the Groupon package I bought), since it will expire in a couple of months anyway."

I am most familiar with GM and note that up until recently they would usually offer solid white, black or Quicksilver as standard no-charge paints. Now silver is $500 and often either solid non-metallic black or white may not even be available on certain models."

https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1213

No car has a claim to fame on a day to celebrate all things plaid quite like the Volkswagen Golf GTI – thanks to one woman’s pioneering choices that over the past four decades have become a symbol of driving enthusiasts worldwide.

The Volkswagen Golf GTI’s debut in 1976 caused a sensation. Even though only a few details distinguished it visually from the original Golf, Volkswagen—influenced by one of the company’s first female designers—succeeded in transforming the compact car into an affordable sports car for the masses and capturing the mood of the era.

Gunhild Liljequist—a porcelain painter and chocolatier candy-box designer by trade—was hired on to Volkswagen’s Germany-based Department of Fabrics and Colors in Wolfsburg in 1964 when she was just 28. Her work focused on paint hues, trims and interior detailing, so when the first Golf GTI came into production in the 1970s, she was tasked with designing various elements of its interior from a sporting angle. Liljequist’s genius centered on giving the GTI two distinct, but simple, textile elements: a tartan seat pattern and a golf ball-style gear knob.

“Black was sporty, but I also wanted color and quality,” Liljequist said. “I took a lot of inspiration from my travels around Great Britain and I was always taken by high-quality fabrics with checked patterns … you could say that there is an element of British sportiness in the GTI.”

And the golf ball gear knob?

“That was a completely spontaneous idea!” Liljequist said. “I just expressed my sporting and golf associations out loud: ‘how about a golf ball as the gear knob?’”

Although her ideas faced some resistance, the tartan seat pattern, now known as “Clark Plaid,” and golf ball knob would become an iconic part of the GTI.

For a woman who personally loved just black and white patterns, color illuminated Liljequist’s professional world throughout her 30-year career at Volkswagen. The 1960s to the 1980s were a highly creative and experimental time in car design, and Liljequist’s work helped to influence some of Volkswagen’s most iconic paint hues, trims and interior detailing, while designing some special models of her own.

Beyond the Golf GTI, her two most notable contributions to the car world was her 1987 limited edition ‘Etienne Aigner’ Mk1 Golf Cabriolet—a car design influenced by the luxury maker of handbags, luggage and various other leather accessories—and her discovery of an iridescent, pearl color that she applied to a car’s surface, using a transparent foil. The metallic quality of paint on modern cars today is in part the result of Liljuquist’s experimentation in paint and coloring. Liljuquist retired in 1991, but her legacy is literally stitched into the fabric of Volkswagen."
4361	October 10, 2019 4:14PM	nyccarguy	On with the new. Plus a very high tech wheel alignment.
4362	October 10, 2019 4:26PM	stickguy	those are cool looking treads. I like them. hopefully though it is a long, long time before I need to worry about SUV tires again.
4363	October 10, 2019 4:46PM	qbrozen	LOL. I was using a similar-looking laser alignment system in my father's shop back in 1992. ;b
4364	October 10, 2019 5:08PM	xwesx	"On vehicle dispositions, I haven't actually had all that many either. I will say, though, that I have never traded in a car.

I have lost two through crashes, one buyback, rest either private party or give away. I don't much feel like taking the time to count them all out. My guess is maybe ten."
4365	October 10, 2019 5:57PM	corvette	Mixed news on the Tahoe. Mechanic was able to reproduce the problem, but thinks it’s something in the gauge cluster. Says there is a local place that does repairs, but said the guy has had mixed luck fixing them and recommends I wait until it gets worse. Not very confidence inspiring. I may see if there’s somewhere I can ship the cluster off for repair.
4366	October 10, 2019 6:01PM	28firefighter	@corvette - what exactly is the issue with the cluster?
4367	October 10, 2019 6:03PM	corvette	"It went completely dead on me while driving the other day - all needles down to zero, then fired back up with the warning chime and lights, then went back to normal.

There have also been some other weird things like the remote start not cranking, and the HVAC temperature turning itself up to high heat, that make me think it’s a battery cable or ground issue and not the gauge cluster."
4368	October 10, 2019 6:25PM	stickguy	sounds like it is time to dump the old beast and go shopping!
4369	October 10, 2019 6:26PM	28firefighter	That is really frustrating.
4370	October 10, 2019 6:26PM	laurasdada	"Jag back from dealer, CEL extinguished (vacuum leak) car washed and vacuumed. Final bill even came out $10 less than original estimate. That bought me lunch.
Nor'easter rains on their way, since the dealer hand-washed the Hag, maybe I'll wax it in the garage later. Now that it's back to 100%, and the $ I've put into it the last year or so, maybe I'll keep it; it looks almost new, too. Keep at least to New Year's Eve, the traditional let's make a car deal day for me..."
4371	October 10, 2019 7:09PM	corvette	To clarify, just the gauge cluster went dead, not the entire truck. But, it never hurts to look, right?

4383	October 10, 2019 9:39PM	xwesx	Sound like you may be having issues with cracked solder, if indeed the cluster is the problem. All of the issues you note could originate with a problem there.
4384	October 10, 2019 9:40PM	andres3	"Sounds like Costco is going to try and avoid accepting my mileage warranty claim on the Pilot Sport 4S's. A bunch of BS about uneven wear.

Well, there are a thousand Discount Tires I can take a swing with!"
4385	October 10, 2019 9:41PM	pensfan83	"Generally yes but the same shop inspected it last year so I'm genuinely confused. When I pointed this out to the SA he said that tech is no longer working there so he can't speak to why he passed it. I asked how they determined it was too loud and whether they used a decibel meter and was told it's a ""very loud"" aftermarket exhaust and he cited the vehicle code as his supporting rationale. When I pressed him on how that was related to the safety inspection he got visibly upset and said his tech told him it would not pass and he was simply passing along the message. I thanked him, took the keys, and left.

It's disappointing because this is a reputable indy Honda/Acura shop and this visit was the total opposite of the first two. I didn't deal with this SA the past 2 times but he was pretty unapologetic and wasn't thrilled when I was asking questions, almost as if I were out of line. If I go back I'll go out of my way to avoid him.

The exhaust isn't some cheap hack job, it was installed cleanly, and wasn't cheap. It's really not any louder than the many other cars with aftermarket bits so it seems subjective."
4386	October 10, 2019 9:43PM	xwesx	"Q7. I have a front wheel bearing failing on mine. 88,000 miles! Ridiculous. I received the new bearing yesterday (HUGE!!), and my new amazing tool kit for replacing the bearing came in today. I'm stoked. Hard to stay at work instead of just running home to play with it.

But, $600 in, and shop wants $1,400. Plus, I would be out that for a one-time deal. Now, if I *ever* have another wheel bearing failure on any car, I'm set.... just the cost of the bearing and a fun hour or so of my life."
4387	October 10, 2019 11:10PM	corvette	"Well, I'm vindicated. (Keep in mind that sometimes it's expensive, irritating, and inconvenient to be vindicated...) Picked up keys and paid shop for diagnosis and an oil change. Took the Infiniti home, walked the dog, then walked back to the repair shop to get the Tahoe. As soon as I took off down the road, I got a ""Stabilitrak off"" error (which immediately went away, then an SRS error, which also went away. Pulled in my driveway and everything electrical went completely dead as soon as I turned the engine off.

Got out the multimeter and I'm showing zero volts once you get past the ""mega fuse"" behind the battery, which explains why nothing works. Apparently the fuse failing, or the terminals around it corroding, are common failures. I couldn't pry the cover off, so no way to be sure."

4390	October 11, 2019 12:08AM	corvette	"The plot thickens. Tow truck driver shows up, connects his jump box to the fused side of the main fuse, and it started right up! He asked if I wanted to just drive it to the shop. Uh, no, I have an AAA subscription for a reason.

Once he got it loaded on the truck, he turned it off, and amazingly, was able to restart it under its own power. Definitely something wonky going on with the fuse block, though."

Took us over a half hour to go 4 miles so ended up getting back at 6:20 to clock out. A very long day and hoping tomorrow won't be as long!
4393	October 11, 2019 1:08AM	Sandman6472	"Another F. Myers run at 6 am today, picked up 6 cargo vans. Chevy's, Ford Transit and a couple Dodge ones. I had a Chevy but bummer, had no usb port so was FM radio the whole way back. Turned into an over 12 hour day again today. First time I made any overtime at the job, worked about 47 hours for the week. My next check should be very healthy! Really wanted to say no but, said it was ""mandatory"", but please come in as we need you. Hard to say no really.
The Enterprise app went through but still, no phone call as was told. Guess they figured I wasn't serios as I didn't accept the Ft. Lauderdale job a couple years back. But this new gig is basically 5 minutes from the house which changes everything really. A short commute with no more tolls would be ideal but guess it ain't meant to be. If it's still posted in Indeed.com, might just send it on through again. Working that close to home would be a great way to go out though."
4394	October 11, 2019 1:37AM	mjfloyd1	"I finally got the refurbished gauge cluster and new dash wiring harness installed in the 63 corvette split window coupe. I put the fuses in and connected the battery and...

It fired right up.


I installed new speedometer and tachometer cables with some cable lubricant. Also installed the refurbished wiper motor.


Still have some adjusting to do, reinstall drivers seat, clock, radio, glovebox.

It is total project creep. Already had seats reupholstered in the finest vinyl (plastique) and new carpets installed. I wonder how long until I decide that the paint does a disservice to the interior??"
4395	October 11, 2019 1:38AM	stickguy	once you start, no looking back!
4396	October 11, 2019 2:46AM	corvette	I'm thinking that bailout-era iron may not be the best quality, although my Tahoe is a late enough build that it (apparently) avoided the bad valve bodies which plagued GM's six speed truck automatics from 2007-early 2009 (my 2008 Yukon was affected, which was the final nail in the coffin for it).
4397	October 11, 2019 2:57AM	suydam	Met with the local GM Finance guy to talk about options for the Volt (lease is up in early December). At this point the residual is lower than the car is worth so that’s good for me. I think buying the car is a cheaper option than leasing a new EV or plug-in, as the Bolt does not appeal to me. And we really like it. I’m going to drive a Leaf Plus this weekend, and unless I’m really wowed, we plan to keep the Volt. Any of you buying out your lease, did you get an extended warranty? I’ve never done that so I’m thinking not. We plan to keep it at least 5 years, and hopefully the Encore will keep trucking on as the runabout second car that long too.
4398	October 11, 2019 3:01AM	stickguy	don't know what the regular warranty is, but just treat it like any used car you are thinking of buying. I have never gotten an extended warranty on anything, but some people like them.
4399	October 11, 2019 3:01AM	corvette	The thing that annoys me about today is that, had the shop done a normal electrical diagnostic instead of driving my work truck around, trying to get the gauges to malfunction, and had they checked the battery terminals, etc., they probably would have found the iffy main fuse, and my truck wouldn't have died in my driveway at all. Of course, I have the benefit of hindsight. I don't think they were incompetent, which is why I had it towed back there, they just didn't do the thing that would have found the problem.
4400	October 11, 2019 12:51PM	kyfdx	If you need me to do some shake-down test driving, let me know..
4401	October 11, 2019 5:33PM	28firefighter	X1 got a clean report back during pre-inspection and the Genius that helped me was wonderful. Basically ran through lease return and gave me her information for when I'm ready to ground it.
4402	October 11, 2019 5:41PM	stickguy	"any progress on the Viggen front?

I still think BaT might take it, even with some cosmetic issues. But what do I know!"
4403	October 11, 2019 5:47PM	28firefighter	"One offer for $6k that I did not counter. Guy last night is mulling it over and I have someone else interested that may want to see it on Sunday.

I really don't want to deal with BaT. The most comparable one I saw went on BaT for $8k and while it didn't have as much maintenance history, it was in much better shape cosmetically. Factor in listing fees, etc., and I think it'd end up being a wash. The last thing I'd want to have happen is to get LESS."
4404	October 11, 2019 5:57PM	corvette	Mechanic cleaned the terminals around the main fuse and cleaned the battery terminals. Drove it 30 minutes with no issues. Hopefully that will take care of it. No additional fee.
4405	October 11, 2019 6:12PM	pensfan83	The Altima was officially transferred today and while the car has received its share of criticisms, none of that will come from me. It was rock solid for nearly 5.5 years with only fluid, tire, and other consumables part of the cost of ownership. It served us well

4408	October 11, 2019 7:19PM	stickguy	"some something interesting yesterday. Not sure where to post (not new or a classic!) so putting it here.

stopped at the local HS for a flu shot, and nearby was a car converted to handicap (wheelchair)accessible, with the ramp that folded out from underneath out the back. That in itself is not uncommon, but usually it is some sort of Minivan, or the purpose built models that look like a tall wagon.

but this car, of all odd things, was a Fiat 500XL. If I had not seen it in action, would not have believed it was big enough to handle the chair in the back. Or strong enough to handle all that extra weight hanging off the rear.

why anyone would think of using a FIAT for that duty is beyond me."
4409	October 11, 2019 7:20PM	stickguy	well, he still has a couple that he bought 30 or so years ago, so definitely not a flipper.
4410	October 11, 2019 7:42PM	xwesx	"Well, replacing the cable and corroded wiring is a cheap fix, and if it isn't the fix, it's cheap insurance against time!

I replaced just the negative cable and last couple inches of wire on my Econoline this summer, and that cleared up a whole host of problems! My son and I agreed that we are going to replace all of the vehicle's wiring next year. Good news: All of the wiring in that vehicle equals about the same as (maybe) the headlight circuit in your Tahoe."
4411	October 11, 2019 7:52PM	xwesx	Hahah; only a little. These guys are welcoming enough to cut a frugal guy like me (and I'm not alone here.... *looks around*....) some slack. I have done my part to add to the numbers a few times! Just because I have those cars several years later...

I'd be more convinced about it not reoccurring if the points of contact had a light coating of non-corrosive paste applied after thoroughly cleaning the mating surfaces before the bolts were tightened. If this wasn't done you could have the problem again but probably not for a long time. Ask your dealer if they applied this goop then you'll know if it's really fixed.

4446	October 12, 2019 9:35PM	suydam	"Still deciding whether to buy out the Volt next month when the lease ends. I drove a Nissan Leaf Plus SL today just to check out what’s new. Really like it. It has a titch more rear seat room than the Encore, still a small vehicle which I like. Acceleration and handling are great and the SL trim is very nice. The one I drove had dark grey exterior, not my fave, but the light grey interior with black trim is very nice.
Overall I see it as a great replacement for the Encore, but not for the Volt. So maybe a few years down the road when we pay off the Volt. Did really enjoy being in a new car though. And it has all the goodies lacking in the Encore. Sigh."

Some months back, I think the new monthly payment was somewhere around $450-$475 a month. Today's email offer told me I can get into a new outback 3.6R for the meager sum of $385 per month.

Of course they are assuming that I still have roughly 18 months worth of payments left to make. They don't know that I own the car free and clear, and it's probably still worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $20,000."
4453	October 12, 2019 11:13PM	suydam	We’d still have the Volt. But we could take longer trips on electric only than currently possible. We do take under a hundred mile trips to visit friends or do shopping, and we are using gas after the first 40 miles, and often the return if we can’t find a handy charging station. I’ve come to prefer the driving dynamics of the EV. And the Volt is not as smooth a driver on gas as in EV mode. Seats in the Leaf Plus are really comfortable too.
4454	October 13, 2019 1:31AM	sda	I am very disappointed that GM cancelled the Volt. It is the the ideal combination of electric and practicality, range anxiety pound sand.
4455	October 13, 2019 1:55AM	stickguy	I saw one parked at Lowes today. Looked sharp.
4456	October 13, 2019 2:32AM	suydam	I’m pretty sure we’ll keep it, pay off early, and at that point sell the Encore and get a Leaf Plus. Price may have come down by then too. Too bad I can’t trade in the Encore to enable buying the Volt with cash. Although the Encore is the Better Half’s preferred vehicle.
4457	October 13, 2019 3:05AM	stickguy	"Subaru is advertising some sort of ""day of the dog"" on 10/22. I told the wife we have to get one that day since we have the yellow lab. She did not buy it.

probably going to be something to revisit in Q1 next year. Being held to the commitment to finish paying down all of the HELOC. Which would officially have us done with paying for college finally! That has been taking a lot of extra each month, so once that drops off, a new car loan payment is going to seem like nothing!

Will also make the Philly auto show (usually the last week of January) really important, because it could be the time to nail down the final short list (other than BMW of course, unless they decide to come back next year!)"
4458	October 13, 2019 3:18AM	breld	"I’m a bit curious on the Leaf myself.

Here in CO, xcel energy provides a $3,000 rebate and the state has a $5,000 tax credit. The Nissan dealers will credit the $8,000 toward the purchase (you assign the credit to them) in addition to whatever dealer discount they provide. Generally, dealers are advertising about $11k off, and then you get the $7,500 federal rebate at tax time.

Pretty good deal."

Most come with a 2yr unlimited mileage warranty. I also observed that most have been serviced and list a new battery as part of the service. I guess sitting for over a year that’s a good idea. They do seem reasonably priced.

4470	October 13, 2019 7:53PM	pensfan83	I took the picture and tossed the flyer, there isn't a chance we do anything until June at the earliest. My understanding is that Acura has an unpublished 6 month pull ahead but only 3 payments are fully waived. The rest are rolled over or you need to write a check.
4471	October 13, 2019 7:57PM	stickguy	"if they aren't cancelling the rest of the payments, it is a 3 month pull ahead, not 6. You can trade it in any time you want on a new lease if you want to deal with the payments.

no way I am giving it back early if I have to pay for the old car and new car at the same time."
4472	October 13, 2019 8:17PM	fintail	That's pretty strict. The MB 6 month pull ahead is well known, and is a clean slate - you just start over. They can bend the rules too, IIRC when I got the Bluetec, it was ~10 months out, they were really itching to get rid of it.

4478	October 14, 2019 1:35AM	corvette	Got the BlueDriver going - it's a neat tool, but unfortunately, it didn't show any codes stored which would point me to the issue with OnStar. I think OnStar, in theory, is a gimmick, and I take issue with some of the fear-mongering ads I've heard on the radio before, but at a discounted rate of $10/month, I think it's reasonable for the automatic crash notification, instant diagnostics if you get a check engine light, and emailing me once a month with my oil life and tire pressures. I could still just cancel my plan and do without. Going to try to do some more research on GM truck-specific forums.
4479	October 14, 2019 2:14AM	Sandman6472	"Pretty BMW though I'd prefer the blue over beige combo. A 328 is something I could really learn to love and the one I'd get if I went German again. But leaning more towards hybrid or electric next time I do purchase. Do believe I'd get another Golf if they still had the SEL version as I made a tremendous mistake by not getting one back in 2014. The few extras it contained are things I really did want and spending the extra $ would've been worth it.
Going forward with the next purchase, plan to really think things out and get exactly what I want, cost be damned. Just not convinced it'll be a 2020 model anymore to be honest. Just going to play it by ear and keep on looking. Think I'll know it when I see it/drive it no matter what ""it"" is. It'll have to put that silly smile on my face like the Golf had done all these years, one when I see it, I'll have that thrilling feeling inside that I own this piece of machinery.

Assuming you or someone is conscious you could just hit the Onstar button and activate the plan.
4482	October 14, 2019 4:52AM	28firefighter	"In case anyone is curious, I was asking $7k for the Viggen and accepted $6500.

My closest “comp” was a lower mileage example (82k miles) that sold on BaT that was in much better cosmetic shape but did not have as much maintenance history available. That vehicle sold for $8k back in April. After figuring listing fees and such, that probably netted the seller $7000-$7500.

Given the cosmetic condition of mine and the higher miles I decided somewhere between $6k-$7k was fair and that if the number pushed to the lower end of that range I would simply hold it.

It went to another Saab enthusiast who had been a longtime 9-3 owner and lost it after someone ran a red. He saw the value in the mechanical condition and pedigree.

It was a fair deal and I feel good about where it went. Sam was upset for a bit and then remembered we still had “Sparky” (the i3) and “Subadoo.” All was right with the world after that."

4487	October 14, 2019 1:59PM	28firefighter	I can't take credit for it. My Dad and I were talking about names with Sam on FaceTime after we got it, and as soon as my Dad said it, Sam latched on.
4488	October 14, 2019 2:00PM	28firefighter	This is exactly the thought process I went down. I either needed to fix it up to my standards and make it a lifetime holder or it was time for it to go. I loved the Viggen, but I never saw it as a forever car.
4489	October 14, 2019 5:05PM	xwesx	You guys are funny. You seem to forget where I am located!
4490	October 14, 2019 5:11PM	xwesx	"My kit did exactly the same thing, except that it cost less than this one (at least from the place I was able to find it, and it is full universal for other makes and models.

Job it done (nearly). I didn't get the brakes set right in terms of the clearing air from the fluid, so I'll need to sort that out to night. But, I now drive in blissful silence. Yay."
4491	October 14, 2019 5:12PM	xwesx	Yeah, forget that! My cordless impact driver did just fine, though. Did the whole job in one battery, too. It finally quit while I was installing the last lug nut.
4492	October 14, 2019 5:14PM	xwesx	For reading, I definitely like my BlueDriver. It doesn't do any sort of send protocols, though, so you cannot use it to reset maintenance reminders, etc.
4493	October 14, 2019 5:32PM	ab348	I remember the episode of Wheeler Dealers when Edd had to change the rear wheel bearing in a Renault Alpine. It was retained by a large outside-thread nut with slots for a special removal tool to to engage. He fabricated his own tool but the thing was on so tight that he had to use heat plus a couple of long pieces of pipe over the wrench handle to get enough leverage, then once that was finally off, a hydraulic press to remove the bearing itself. No fun.
4494	October 14, 2019 5:58PM	xwesx	The original bearing was horridly difficult to remove, but it did finally come out. Thankfully, the reinstall was much smoother.
4495	October 14, 2019 6:35PM	stickguy	Gonna get grit in your bearings working on the ground like that!
4496	October 14, 2019 6:38PM	xwesx	Only in the ones I don't want. I'm used to working in these conditions; been doing it for decades. I'm actually very thankful that I had neither rain nor snow (well, no more than a dusting) during this weekend's activity. Temps were even tolerable at about -1-2C (28-30F) for the duration.
4497	October 14, 2019 6:56PM	marcogallo1986	@ 20 fire fighter yes sad day but at least it went to a good home.
4498	October 14, 2019 6:57PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest Nice which car was it that you did this work on this past weekend?
4499	October 14, 2019 7:37PM	xwesx	Q7
4500	October 14, 2019 8:40PM	laurasdada	"The boy picks up the ""new"" 3 on Wednesday; I've given him much fatherly advice on maintenance and the requirement to now have $ in the bank for the necessary and inevitable's...
Business Manager made a mild effort to sell warranties, mostly tire/wheel. But, I explained ""self-insure"" to the boy and declined.

Jag went in Thursday to fix vacuum leak, all now appears well. Cost more than I had hoped, but less than I expected, so I'll call it a win. Since they hand washed (and vacuued) I applied the winter coat of polymer. Now that I've invested a decent amount of $ in it the last year or so, I'm likely going to keep it a bit longer. Not to mention it still looks new-ish and drives so darn well. But, I'll retain the option of New Year's Eve bargaining.

I think buying the Mazda 3 scratched the itch, for now. But, jealous the boy gets a ""new"" car and I'm driving a nearly 7 year old sled. I stink at this CCB thing."

4502	October 14, 2019 11:19PM	xwesx	They took pains to not mention or show the miles, so it is quite safe to assume MANY. That said, it does look good; definitely a great color combo for the year.

just too bad it isn't bright screaming yellow!"
4509	October 15, 2019 12:15AM	stickguy	X5 is nice looking. Seats are actually in better than expected condition, especially if high miles. One of my favorite color combos.
4510	October 15, 2019 12:48AM	breld	Congrats @28firefighter on the sale. I haven’t done it in awhile, but it’s certainly a satisfying feeling completing a private sale.
4511	October 15, 2019 12:54AM	kyfdx	Not mine. My son’s friend went to Missouri to get it. One owner Baja turbo with a stick. 160K miles. I drove it.. fast and solid. Bone stock. Interior looks like a 50K mile unit. Pretty sweet.
4512	October 15, 2019 12:57AM	kyfdx	Another visitor this weekend:
4513	October 15, 2019 1:00AM	breld	"Quick public service message for my friends here.

I was looking to buy some tix for this Thursday night's Broncos game - my stepdaughter and her boyfriend are using our pair of season tickets, but thought I'd buy a few more for me and the boys to go.

I normally go through ticketmaster, but thought I'd browse craigslist. Corresponded with someone, asking what I thought were the right questions to the point I decided it was legitimate. Transferred funds to him through Zelle (via my bank's website) and then....nothing.

Shame on me and I certainly feel foolish. But I put too much weight on using Zelle through my bank's website - I figured you were protected somehow but not the case. And from a Google search, that's exactly what scammers rely on to get you.

Anyway - just thought I'd pass that lesson along."
4514	October 15, 2019 1:00AM	28firefighter	I think that had the same engine as the Outback XT of that era right?
4515	October 15, 2019 1:04AM	kyfdx	I “think” it has the Forester XT engine. But, I’m not sure. It’s definitely fast.
4516	October 15, 2019 1:04AM	kyfdx	Bummer. Sorry to hear that
4517	October 15, 2019 1:08AM	kyfdx	Wikipedia thinks I’m wrong. Says 2.5 turbo from the Outback. It’s basically a pup version of the Outback, so that makes sense
4518	October 15, 2019 1:22AM	suydam	It happens to a lot of people! Even the actor Alec Baldwin got scammed out of tickets to a Liberty Island boat tour for his family a couple of weeks ago. One does feel foolish but as long as they didn’t also help themselves to CC numbers or your account it’s just one of those things. Ticketmaster’s fees are annoying, but I guess this is why we pay them.
4519	October 15, 2019 1:22AM	corvette	I was about to comment on the lack of info on the mileage. I think those shared a lot of parts with the E39, which also does not bode well. On the plus side, if it has 200k, it's probably on its third or fourth set of control arm bushings!
4520	October 15, 2019 1:35AM	qbrozen	I had those fears when shopping for tix for my son and me. Back and forth with someone on CL and asked if he’d take paypal because then I’d be protected. He said no, so I said no deal. Then found someone through the facebook tickets group. Turns out you can find a group for pretty much any team of people selling and buying tix. Helps to be able to see the person’s history and feedback, plus he took paypal.
4521	October 15, 2019 1:35AM	stickguy	Bummer Breld. I avoid CL like the plague. Even FB has a lot of scams, but at least you can know you are dealing with a local person. Problem is, even if you meet in person for hard copies, no guarantee they aren't fake. So paying the extra from the official team source at least gets you peace of mind.
4522	October 15, 2019 2:13AM	breld	"All the tickets are digital these days, so at least no worry about fake paper tickets. I saw some who posted on craigslist said they would meet the buyer in person and complete the transaction that way - so money changes hands and the tickets are transferred on the spot.

Oh well - it's a bummer, but lesson learned and it's not the end of the world. I went ahead and bought real tickets this evening - through Ticketmaster's NFL Ticket Exchange."
4523	October 15, 2019 2:38AM	kyfdx	Stubhub?
4524	October 15, 2019 2:41AM	kyfdx	Yikes!
4525	October 15, 2019 3:01AM	28firefighter	I happen to think it’s an improvement. But still pretty awful.
4526	October 15, 2019 3:12AM	stickguy	"not feeling it. Wheels suck too. and as a topper, I think white is a lousy color on that car.

other than that, what's not to like?"
4527	October 15, 2019 12:13PM	qbrozen	"The tix I bought for this Sunday’s game are paper, along with a premium parking pass. Hopefully not fake but we’ll find out.

So on the stereo front, I received an email from the place I ordered the head unit from. They claim it is out of stock and have offered a different unit that is $15 more and doesn’t even have carplay. So I went to the site to search for other models and the one I ordered popped up as a “flash sale” and 62/240 sold. I replied to the email, pasted that link, and asked them to explain how they are still selling it and claim to have them in stock.

Just like a car dealer advertising a screamer on a specific stock unit that is always sold yet continuously advertised, no?"
4528	October 15, 2019 1:01PM	tjc78	I've seen those games with sellers. I think they don't take the ads down because then they have to pay more listing fees.
4529	October 15, 2019 1:59PM	pensfan83	@breld have you initiated a dispute through your bank for the Zelle payment? Your bank should have a fraud unit dedicated to investigating transactions like that. I would submit a dispute and let them take it from there. If you have additional questions you can PM me directly.
4530	October 15, 2019 2:14PM	28firefighter	Glad to see @pensfan83 weigh in - I've not had a dispute over Zelle, but I know US Bank offers at least an investigation if you get taken advantage and it may result in getting your money back depending on what the outcome shows.
4531	October 15, 2019 5:43PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest Nice on the brakes being done on the shoe seven, how is everything else going otherwise. Do use Facebook, go to go on it there’s plenty of stuff there on my Thunderbird if you wanna check it out and see. Haven’t posted much lately but there’s plenty to go through. My name just like on here. I also use Instagram to. If anyone else on here is also interested since I have no clue how to post pictures on here it’s iffy with this voiceover and voice dictation with this website. I don’t 100% blind accessible ha ha.
4532	October 15, 2019 5:43PM	marcogallo1986	@ Send man, hope you’re having a good week so far. You have the right idea take your time and get what you exactly want options and everything.
4533	October 15, 2019 5:46PM	marcogallo1986	@ Stick guy, that’s cool but that person who is in the wheelchair had a Fiat 500 X, it’s definitely different then your normal minivan I have a friend who has I think he still has it I haven’t seen him in forever we used to work with had a jeep patriot he was in a wheelchair.
4534	October 15, 2019 6:28PM	xwesx	"Going well! Finished up the wheel bearing project last night by finally figuring out how to bleed the brake system properly on that car (turns out, there are two bleeders per wheel). Yesterday, the brakes were rather interesting. I felt like I was driving my old van again... when the master cylinder was failing! LOL Things are dreamy today.

I also had a road rager go off on me this morning. That was fun. Driving in the mid-dawn, no lights, tailgating. He decided that me driving in the left lane on a busy street-level artery at five over the limit was not okay. He swings around me on the right, cuts off car behind and me as well, then swings back to the right lane at the light ahead because there were fewer cars there. Somehow stalls his old Tahoe (late 90s vintage), so the light turns green and everyone goes... guy just sits there. Then, he gets it started, flys along the road again cutting off cars as he weaves back up to my tail, then swings around me in the left turn lane as I am slowing at the next red light, slams on his brakes, skids about 50% in to the intersection only partly back in the left lane (just ahead of me), gets out of his car yelling profanities.... I just smiled and shook my head in pity. Guy is literally having a full-on tantrum.

He finally gets back in his vehicle before the light turns green and peels away. Sadly, he didn't crash and kill himself (or, thankfully, anyone else) that I saw, but he was going insanely fast at that point and was gone in no time. Happily, my daughter was reading in the back and didn't notice any of this going on (Yay for Q7 having excellent sound insulation!).

I'm having a great day though, so I decided to extend a little grace to this doofus and not call him in. Probably should have, but so it goes. I might have his little rant on dash cam though. LOL."
4535	October 15, 2019 6:49PM	breld	"Yes, I called my bank (US Bank) immediately and they did open up a case to investigate. I'm just not that hopeful of having the funds returned based on what I've read.

The thing that frustrated me the most was the individual I spoke to on the phone, who was very nice, stated that the website clearly says something about using Zelle for friends and family. I did take some offense at that and explained to her how the website does no such thing and instead outwardly promotes the service as a partnership between US Bank and Zelle."
4536	October 15, 2019 7:02PM	stickguy	I can see there point about not being there problem. Nobody took money from or hacked your account. You gave it to them willingly. Not really any different than if you wrote a check that was cashed. Would you have asked the bank to refund that?
4537	October 15, 2019 7:03PM	pensfan83	"Uhhh, no. Zelle is a P2P payment platform similar to Venmo except it is managed by specific financial institutions, which your bank and my employer/my bank participates in. What she may have meant to say, albeit poorly, is that it's meant for family and friends you trust, which still doesn't make it any easier to hear.

Investigations into Zelle fraud are out of my space but given what needs to be supplied to enable transfers and the fact only limited banks participate, I would think it should be relatively easy to pinpoint the perpetrator."
4538	October 15, 2019 7:08PM	stickguy	Pens, conceptually, isn’t that something to help out the police, if the customer files a complaint with them? To help the cops find the thief. And not something the bank would track down on their own and take action on?
4539	October 15, 2019 7:10PM	stickguy	I really like the looks of the new ranger. Ford dealer by me has a row right on the road and I drove by them again today, and they always catch my eye. Might not feel same way if I drive one, from what I’ve read. Hopefully the updated model arrives soon. And doesn’t bloat up.
4540	October 15, 2019 7:22PM	Sandman6472	"Had the Golf re-aligned this am and got it back in worse condition with the wheel cocked more to the left than beforehand! Wasn't happy so stopped by another Tires Plus and they did it again, this time with better results. 2nd guy said it was out a bit which I found interesting as I had only driven maybe 40 miles in between alignments. I didn't hit nothing so guessing someone didn't do it right. Expires on the 19th but I'm done now and not sure I'm going to renew it. It's a bit cheaper if I do renew before it expires and did ask about a discount if we got three policies, figured one for the A3 and the other for the Accent. They are transferable one time to another vehicle, did it with the Civic and the Tucson and someone let me put the remainder on the Golf's first year...wink, wink! But it wasn't my high school friend who helped me out there.
The Cruze is coming down on Thursday and we're going to have them fix the radio problem she's having. Chevy store is super close, next to the Hyundai place, and she'll just use the Golf if they need hers over nite. It's her birthday weekend and her old company needs her to stop by as she's doing some special project for them remotely like when she worked for them from St. Cloud. The Accent is also coming in for the weekend so we'll have a full driveway.
Called Waste Pro and complained about their trash vehicle backing up on the fresh asphalt and taking a tire tread of it off. We waited a total of four days, only required two, of no driving on it and the only mark is a wider tire backing in like I've seen the trash truck do numerous times. Started a report and we'll see what they'll do to fix it. No other marks from our vehicles and it's been about three weeks since it was done. Hoping they'll do the right thing here and make it right as it looks bad really."
4541	October 15, 2019 7:24PM	pensfan83	"If a determination by the investigating unit determines it's fraud it could go down the path of law enforcement notification but in situations like this fraud can be hard to prove. Misrepresentation and financial loss are present but the false statements made by the sellers could probably be twisted around by them to make it seem more like a misunderstanding (i.e. they were selling tickets on behalf of someone else who didn't follow through).

There are banks who screen users against derogatory lists and those which match Zelle patterns (in and out) to historical account patterns and flag them accordingly, but the main problem with Zelle and other P2P platforms like Venmo is there are no consumer protections, the risk is 100% on the users and the agreement pretty much states that fact. If nothing else reporting the fraud gets it on the record."
4542	October 15, 2019 7:42PM	Sandman6472	"Ran out of vehicles on Saturday, have never seen that happen! Two folks made reservations Saturday morning but we only had enough vehicles for the reservations made by Friday afternoon. Folks weren't happy but it's really a computer error as one can't make a reservation and walk in an hour or two later and expect a vehicle waiting for them. Turns out that between 11:30 and noon, we had three folks return vehicles but one never knows. Felt kinda bad for those others but when I went to our other office to get my vehicle and clock ot, saw them both there waiting for a vehicle. The other store closes an hour later so they were sent over there.
There was some kind of festival in Miami over the holiday weekend and both us and Enterprise ran out of vehicles so I heard. The computers only close out the ""area"" when this happens and doesn't do the individual locations which really sucks. The program should be able to close out those branches that have no extra vehicles so it's a more real time scenario. Asked about why it can't do that and was just told the computer program isn't that sophisticated, but seems to me, should be real time.
I do know that some folks have argued because they didn't get the exact car in the pic that they ordered but if they had read the fine print, it would've shown, ""or similar vehicle"" as no way can we usually get exact vehicles. Honestly, we do the best we can and when we can, we do but it's not that easy. I know since I'm usually moving the vehicles around. We go to either maintenance or the new car area or the airport and we get vehicles if we can. Usually, one of these locations has a certain amount set aside for ""HLE"" locations, so we take those. But the logistics are quite interesting honestly. That's the main reason we go out of the area some times to get excess vehicles they have just sitting there. Ft. Myers, West Palm or Boca Raton are the usual out of area places we go but last week, it was Naples and a few months ago, Vero Beach. On those farther trips, we usually try to take as many folks as possible to make it worthwhile really. Going to Ft. Myers for just two vehicles sometimes really isn't worth it but if we're low on vehicles, usually end up with a short road trip, my favorite!
That job I turned down months ago at Enterprise was only for my county, Broward County. That, the out of place meeting location and the lower pay/hour led me to turn it down. Once they advertised for a driver position within 5 miles of the house almost two weeks ago, I again applied for and am still waiting on the call! Doubt they will which is a shame as the location is so much closer to our house that I said I'd take a slight cut in pay to drive less miles and have no more tolls to pay. Guessing the guy who interviewed me is still pissed I didn't quit Hertz and jump ship back when. Not fair really as this job has a much better location for me which I stressed when I resent my resume. Guess they're still pissed off or the job location wasn't what they advertised for. They have corporate offices where the position called for, very close to where we live. And I would've left Hertz for it as I want to wind down my working within the next few months or so."
4543	October 15, 2019 7:42PM	ab348	"The editorial side of Edmunds just today released their assessment of midsize pickup trucks. I watched the video where they laid it all out. Their ranking:

1. Ridgeline
2. Jeep Gladiator
3. Tacoma
4. and 5. Colorado/Canyon (tie)
6. Ranger
7. Frontier

I found it somewhat odd as they said the Ridgeline was #1 despite it not being real great offroad because it was good in the areas most users tend to find important, then put the next 2 choices where they did because of their off-road capabilities. I actually do think the Ridgeline is probably the best choice for most people given how folks tend to use these vehicles, but if you accept that as criteria #1 the next two don't deserve to be in those spots. Ah well.

The video laid out their reasons for ranking the Ranger below the others, but basically it came down to a dated feel to the vehicle and some less than sparkling design choices."
4544	October 15, 2019 7:47PM	kyfdx	"I've used it to send money to my son.

Doesn't the end recipient have to download their account info to Zelle, to receive funds?

I don't know if it works that way, because he's never sent any money back the other direction."
4545	October 15, 2019 7:47PM	xwesx	Well, the good news for Ford is that this does not keep the vehicles from selling! I see them regularly now.
4546	October 15, 2019 7:48PM	stickguy	Ridgeline is likely best overall option. I’m not likely to tow or off road. Canyon could be nice too as a compromise. I’m not worried about dates styling choices, if it looks ok. But handling ride and braking do matter!
4547	October 15, 2019 7:52PM	Sandman6472	"We have Colorado's/Canyons at work and they really are a blast to drive. Prefer them to the Silverado's any day. Drove a couple new Ram trucks last week and found them very enjoyable to drive. A bit too big for my tastes but fun they sure were. Brand new with the plastic still on the seats. But the Canyon/Colorado cousins are a much better size and easier to drive around town and especially park. Deep down, still lusting over a two door Jeep Wrangler hardtop to be totally honest. Know the mpg's suck big time, but they are a hoot to drive. Sure, too big for my side of the garage and super thirsty, but if those two issues were overcome, I'd sure love one as my d d.
We've been getting in a bunch more 2019 models lately and instead of all of them going to the airport first, the HLE's are getting our fair share now and folks seem to like 'em. Most of the 2018 and earlier models are either going to wholesale or to TNC for Lyft/Uber use. We all love getting to pick up new vehicles with all the plastic inside and just license plates installed and the Mulrooney stickers on the dash or in it. Very nice to get a vehicle with 5 or 6 miles on the odometer and having to go to the respective airports to get filled up so we can take them to our offices. And they get all different makes and models to."
4548	October 15, 2019 8:35PM	stickguy	2 door wrangler is real short. Would fit easily. Only 164 inches, so about the size of the golf. Just make sure your back can stand the stiff ride!
4549	October 15, 2019 8:40PM	suydam	Gotta disagree with you on one point, Sandy. If I made a reservation and was promised a car, and was told “they just ran out”, that would be the last time I’d use that company. And Hertz costs more too, so you expect better service. Not even the cheap companies like Budget or Dollar have done that to me.
4550	October 15, 2019 8:44PM	stickguy	I would lose my **** if that happened. Once they accepted the reservation, there better be a car there, or get me one real quick.
4551	October 15, 2019 8:48PM	laurasdada	"To paraphrase the great philosopher, Seinfeld: ""I know what a reservation is."" ""No, apparently you don't!"""
4552	October 15, 2019 8:50PM	laurasdada	IIRC, Motorweek ran the same comparo; Ridgeline also #1. Jeep further down the list...
4553	October 15, 2019 8:52PM	stickguy	They are ignoring the biggest factor. Tough guy image. Being better for what you actually use the truck for is less important for most people.
4554	October 15, 2019 9:19PM	ab348	No, I think that is why the Gladiator and the Tacoma are #2 and 3. Most people never take them off-road but like the image that they might. I don't understand the Gladiator at all. Expensive, paying for lots of stuff most will never use (removable doors, roof, and folding windshield) and as the Edmunds piece revealed, it needs some pricey aftermarket additions to make it actually work off-road.
4555	October 15, 2019 9:36PM	stickguy	The test results accounts for best for purpose. Sales results factor in image.
4556	October 15, 2019 9:54PM	marcogallo1986	@lorastata. Nice your son picks up his new ride tomorrow, and good you told him about all the clothes along with owning a vehicle. Yes you have to get on it and getting a new ride for yourself, I should speak for myself in here I’m worse.
4557	October 15, 2019 9:54PM	marcogallo1986	Nice write up from Edwins on the pick up trucks, every magazine has her own things with that but I mean they have the right idea what matters rough and tough image doesn’t matter to most, really wouldn’t matter for me.
4558	October 15, 2019 10:10PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest when the job went well and you are able to bleed the brakes on the Q7. Sorry to hear about the road rage incident you have this morning you did the right thing not worth reacting entertain them. Funny that his Tahoe stalled that’s what happens the crazy people like that I would’ve been funny if it wouldn’t start again I were really laughed Adam and just left and been on my way.

4560	October 15, 2019 10:14PM	marcogallo1986	@ sandman, wow good quite the weekend last weekend and having quite the week this week, I’m glad to hear everything is going well with you and the family. Nice on your daughter is coming home next weekend to visit and you being one of your daughters birthdays, and hopefully the Chevy dealer who you want to fix her cruise radio issue the same day, and I have to keep the car overnight. You’re such an awesome job that’s when I wish I was able to drive would love the job. Love you and all the cars transport and get to drive my cousins friends post to do that their college kids for one of them is in one store in college and then finish his offer The one did a semester of college at community college but does the job too I think one works for enterprise one works for Hertz by here but all the cars they drive to all the time I’ve been through all you guys do the job so awesome.
4561	October 15, 2019 10:16PM	marcogallo1986	That’s true for Ford Ranger two weeks ago with my cousin, he was upfront with a sales person, and I was in the backseat, drove fine to me, it was an ex LT, only thing I didn’t like it sometimes you felt the transmission downshift I’m slowing down probably cause it has so many years that’s the 10 speed they put in that. But other than that it was OK I mean material quality is not bad not top-notch either but not horrible. Wouldn’t mind a truck in red or blue they have an orange color they like also but red or blue or my things. Sounds like one of those older Toyota T sixes or Nissan be six years and it’s a four maybe at some sound sensitizer that they use to make it sound that way there’s no way they can make a force sound that good.
4562	October 15, 2019 10:34PM	kyfdx	That's what happens, when there is no penalty on the rentee for not showing up.

4565	October 15, 2019 11:41PM	ab348	The best part of that scene was Jerry pantomiming snatching pretend reservation slips out of the air as he delivered that line. Breaks me up every time.
4566	October 16, 2019 12:48AM	corvette	"Mixed bag on the BlueDriver dongle... Found nothing significant on the Tahoe. Bluetooth and OnStar both dead. There are a few references online to the VCIM (OnStar / Bluetooth module) having a bad backup battery, but I'm not sure that mine even has a backup battery, as many/most do not, and it appears that the other functionality still works when the backup battery dies. You can't probe specific modules with the BlueDriver, and it looks like even GM's own Tech 2 tool has limited functionality for diagnosing this type of issue. I'm not sure how far down the rabbit hole I'm going to go, here, since I don't make calls in the car, and the OnStar is of limited usefulness.

I was considering returning it, but the BlueDriver redeemed itself on the G37. Ever since I got it, it would randomly (1/50 or 1/100 times) delay to unlock when using the smart key, and sound the alarm instead. I suspected the BCM had water damage from the sunroof drain leak, but couldn't confirm. The BlueDriver pulled several codes, a couple of which relate back to BCM issues, so I reset them and will wait for the problem to recur to see which codes reappear when I replicate the problem."
4567	October 16, 2019 1:10AM	Sandman6472	"But one must be reasonable. One can not make a reservation after a certain point in the day and expect a vehicle to be waiting. At least one of these folks made the reservation at 8 am and wanted to pick it up at 10, on a Saturday when we open at 9. That's not reasonable as we do our darndest to get most vehicles at the location the night before the reservation is made for. Folks have to give us a reasonable amount of time to get the class of vehicle reserved and doing it a couple hours before we open is just not reasonable!
To be honest though, Saturday was the first time I saw that happen. But being a holiday weekend and a big festival down in Miami made things difficult. Even the airport was out of vehicles. And the prices for the weekend I heard were higher than normal because of the extra demand for vehicles. Just part of the game though. And as I said f you read the whole thing, those folks were sent to our sister office which closed an hour later and just had to wait for incoming vehicles. They were accommodated the best way possible due to the circumstances. Best to make a reservation enough time in advance to make sure you will get it is the best advice I could give."
4568	October 16, 2019 1:21AM	stickguy	Disagree Sandy. the reservation system technology is more than capable of knowing when there were no more cars, and should not take the reservation. It would be like a hotel renting rooms after they were fully booked, and telling you to go sit in the lobby in case someone decides to check out early.
4569	October 16, 2019 1:24AM	28firefighter	100% disagree, Sandy. If I make a reservation day of and the system allows it, there darn well better be a car.
4570	October 16, 2019 1:26AM	Sandman6472	"A good number of folks also just don't show up. My office usually calls folks when we know it's going to be a busy day to make sure they are still coming in. Totally rude when folks just don't bother to say they aren't coming after all. But have seen a lot of rude, nasty behavior from clients and so glad I'm not behind the counter. I have a low tolerance for mean and entitled folks who are just plain rude. I would not be able to hold back my mouth with some of the rude people I've witnessed act out. And please, don't get me started at how some folks are just real PIGS, no other way to say it...PIGS!!! Seen some trashed vehicles come back with chicken bones in the center console. Seen feces rubbed on a headliner and pee on the seats and floors. Pen marks on headliners, burn marks in seats where it says ""No Smoking"" on the windshield and dash. I could go on but think y'all get my drift. So many newer vehicles trashed. Seen some where the tires have been swapped, one where the trunk was re-painted...very badly.
I treat any rental like it was my own so don't understand the way some treat their rentals. But just part of the business and luckily, we now take actual pictures of every vehicle we rent so we know what dents were where or what body part with the dent before a renter takes possession. And just like the guy last week who parked his return in such a way that we couldn't see the damage right off. He ran in, threw the keys down and said he had to run before he could be waited on and cleared. Dumb [non-permissible content removed] must of forgot about the pics we take or that we had his cell and business phone in the contract. Plus his c c on file. No way he was gonna get away with it but obviously he thought he would be his actions on return. I just had to laugh as I watched it happen!"
4571	October 16, 2019 2:03AM	suydam	Well, some of them may be just tired, especially after they just got off a long flight trapped like sardines. All they want is to get to their hotel room and stretch out — and then there’s NO CAR for them. I’d flip too. And I agree that if there aren’t cars available the company should tell them that upfront. I know there are very rude entitled people out there and I’m sure all service industries see their fair share, but frustrations do boil over sometimes.
4572	October 16, 2019 2:15AM	fintail	Paraphrasing something I read awhile back: Trucks used to be used as tools, now they are used by tools. No offense to the Tacoma/4Runner drivers/lovers here, but those and Jeeps seem to draw in the shouty sports parent types like moths to a flame.
4573	October 16, 2019 2:18AM	fintail	I've had a few instances of not receiving the category I booked (I then play hard for an upgrade if they aren't offering it upfront, and always get it) but never arrived anywhere to zero cars. I recall at MKE after the poor Grand Cherokee was rendered not roadworthy, the agent told me I was getting the last car they had available. Although I have to imagine that was just for a short specific point in time, and in an hour they had more.
4574	October 16, 2019 6:08AM	xwesx	"Honestly, every time I have done a car rental, I always get a larger/different car from what I reserve. I don't mind, as usually it is better than what I would have had. In one case, I asked them for a Fiesta just because I wanted to give one a good long test drive since I was interested in buying soon (and I did!). So, I got a compact, but I reserved an intermediate. They originally offered to give me a full size.

The only bad rental experiences I have had were my first one, when I was still very young (maybe 24 or 25) and they tried to give me an ashtray packaged as a car. It was the holiday season and they were not very willing to swap me out. However, I out-stubborned them. I ended up with the same class of car, but non-smoked. It was just dropped off and not yet cleaned, but the car was clean enough for my needs and a far sight better than that first one! Eech.

Last one was the Santa Fe with the bald tires. Goodness that was an adventure. LOL"

4591	October 16, 2019 11:57PM	corvette	Got the bid from my contractor for the Trex deck (demo old deck and underpinnings and install new)... Hold on to your hats, folks! $76 per square foot.

Same guy I used for installing Hardieplank last year - his bid seemed high for that, too, but it was at least within shooting distance of the online calculators I had done. This one is not. To be fair, I picked the highest grade of Trex, but there's not a huge difference in materials cost between the cheap one and this. Trex actually tells you on their website roughly what the materials will cost. Getting another bid from a guy who exclusively does decks and nothing else.

Saved by Waze on the way down as there was apparently a horrible crash in Chattanooga that shut down both directions of traffic. It routed me to 41 and 5 miles later, I was on a very unbusy I 75.

After some reflection, I decided that the steering angle sensor made the most sense. Couldn’t find any specific info online telling me where the heck it is, but after looking everywhere that was exposed, I figured taking off the steering wheel was the next step. Removing the airbag made me nervous but I managed to not hurt myself. To my somewhat pleasant surprise, when I finally got to the sensor, I found the plug was not seated. Promising. But I swapped the sensor anyway while there.

Put it all together, reconnected battery, and turned her on. And ..... errors. Sigh. Clear the codes, reread the codes, and now they are totally different. Hmmmm... ok, different could be good. Let’s me know I at least did SOMETHING. I believe it may be an issue of initializing the sensor, which I have yet to find out how to do. I may need a GM scan tool."

Will try the local Chevy store and see if they can fix it under warranty as it's only 8 months she's owned it. Nice vehicle to be honest though I'd have gotten the hatch like she was supposed to. Said she felt it was too small though looks to be the perfect size for me. Shame Chevy is killing off the Cruze after this years run!

4618	October 17, 2019 3:58PM	Sandman6472	"No, something like a faulty infotainment system wouldn't qualify under the Lemon Law as the vehicle is functioning as designed, no mechanical failures to speak of. And there's no danger that could be caused by this issue. No, it's a warranty issue that Chevy will just have to deal with. Luckily it happened before the first year was up so they have plenty of time to rectify the situation. Besides this small issue, she loves the vehicle. Looks beautiful in the darker blue and since it's an ""RS"" model, much of the trim is blacked out as are the Chevy bowties front and rear. It's also a fun vehicle to drive and has a decent stereo. I would of preferred the hatch personally and she went in thinking of only the hatch but found it to be a bit on the small side and wanted a bit bigger. Now for me, the smaller the better. But, it just hasn't hit me that it's the vehicle for me so I'm not looking at one anymore. But in the right color combo with the correct options, I could be tempted to switch out but know after a little bit of time, I'd regret that decision. And am not doing ""a Tucson"" as I call it now, getting a new vehicle I really shouldn't be buying! I'll know it when I see it, drive it...just like happened with my first drive in my Golf. I knew within 5 minutes that this would eventually be mine. Maybe not that year but eventually, I'd be owning a VW Golf. To me, it was that good.
So far, haven't driven another vehicle where I got that same vibe besides that white Porsche I drove a few months back. It was pure joy and was magical once I mashed down on the accelerator. From a driving perspective, that Escape I drove yesterday was very impressive and fun. I got ""that smile"" on my face!!"

4631	October 18, 2019 3:45AM	28firefighter	Well, in fairness, you do have a commute.
4632	October 18, 2019 4:33AM	Michaell	And hockey...
4633	October 18, 2019 6:53AM	xwesx	The XT engine doesn't have the same issues as the EJ25 when it comes to head gaskets. But, agreed that it will need a going through on other items given the age. Quite a unicorn, especially if it doesn't have a brutal past. I went looking for one several years ago, and they were not easy to come by in good condition.
4634	October 18, 2019 12:03PM	stickguy	dang Bradd, you are going to be way over miles at this pace. And definitely not something that makes sense to buy at the end with an 85% residual (or something close to that)!
4635	October 18, 2019 12:10PM	nyccarguy	The commute is definitely part of it. Probably a little over 1,400 miles. My sons have had a few away games (West Haven - 100 miles RT, Newington - 150 miles RT, Bolton - 180 miles RT, Springfield - 205 miles RT) which is about 635 miles. Another 500 or so miles driving around town.
4636	October 18, 2019 12:37PM	tjc78	"You can average that back down though, can't you? Drive the Prelude on nice days?

My Volvo is actually a touch over already (150 miles) because of some trips to the shore and I also took it to MD on Wednesday. Swap cars with the wife for a few days here or there and it will get right back to where it should be or under. Her ride to the train station is 10 miles round trip."
4637	October 18, 2019 12:44PM	stickguy	Looks like I should be somewhere around 7,500-8,500 on the tlx at one year make. At about 6,600 at about 10 months. Depends on if I take another 600 mile RT to NY next weekend. Otherwise it sits around a lot during the week.
4638	October 18, 2019 12:48PM	nyccarguy	"The Prelude is a non issue for now. It will need a new timing belt/ water pump/ balance shaft seals soon as well as new tires. If I had to drive it in an emergency, I wouldn't hesitate. Right now it is parked in my driveway under a blanket, resting comfortably. Maybe I'll have those issues addressed in the Spring.

When I had the Pilot last week to put new tires on it, my wife drove the Tacoma. She wasn't too enthusiastic about it to say the least. In fact, she said to me when we were out to dinner something to the effect of: ""Enjoy your pickup for the next 2 years. I want you to get a car when the lease is up. I like having a car to drive.""

I took the 15K per year lease KNOWING that I would go over the mileage. TFS only charges $.15 per mile if you go over."
4639	October 18, 2019 12:53PM	tjc78	.15 isn't bad. I know Volvo and a lot of other makes is .25.
4640	October 18, 2019 2:03PM	ab348	Well, there. You've been TOLD.
4641	October 18, 2019 2:05PM	28firefighter	"@xwesx - Interesting regarding the XT engines - I've seen quite a few for sale locally over the last couple years that all seemed to have blown heads OR recently redone heads. Just assumed it was a Subaru thing.

I looked for one of these heavily when I was looking at the Viggen. I love all the hits in that series - the Legacy GT, Legacy GT Spec B, and Outback XT."
4642	October 18, 2019 4:03PM	breld	"My mileage has decreased dramatically since we moved.

But my wife's has gone the other way, as expected. She has put something around 4-5k miles on her Alltrack since acquiring it."
4643	October 18, 2019 4:13PM	jpp75	"Very nice! I'm about to hit 10k after 10 months of ownership. I have 15k/yr so there's some cushion there but I've put almost 3k on the C30 since January so if I didn't have that I'd be closer to my limit.

I got a Canyon SLE as a rental while traveling for work this week, it was a 2WD V6, bright red and had about 11k miles on it. It's definitely faster than the Tacoma, but otherwise I prefer the Tacoma overall.

The wind noise at highway speed was some of worst I've heard in a long time. It was somewhere near the top of the driver's side windshield. At first I assumed it was a poor replacement job, but the windshield seemed original. I still can't get used to the low rent interior, I don't understand how GM produces such horrible interiors. My coworker traveling with me (who has also ridden in my Tacoma a few times) mentioned that the Tacoma is much better all around. It's a shame because I do like the styling, but the interior and overall quality were just a big letdown."
4644	October 18, 2019 4:28PM	breld	"Got the winter wheel set on the A5 last week - the wheel spacers recommended by @mjfloyd1 made a huge difference in the overall look. Looks ""right"" now instead of last year when they looked just a bit funny.

Knowing I'll want to eventually replace said A5 with an SUV, I'm obviously browsing...

My brother has this same car in blue...Q5 3.0T:

https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/784798411/overview/

Or for a little more (and perhaps a little compromise on model year and/or miles) I could go back to an SQ5:

https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/785619483/overview/

Like most of us would be, I'm naturally drawn to the SQ5. But the somewhat more sedate Q5 with the 3.0T is attractive in its own right. If there was a larger price difference it'd be an easy decision, but since they're fairly close it's hard to ignore the extra touches on the S version."
4645	October 18, 2019 5:30PM	mjfloyd1	"Glad the spacers worked out.

I just remembered that while driving through Georgia, I saw a non-hellcat Charger with a license plate that read
HECKCAT"
4646	October 18, 2019 5:58PM	pensfan83	We have about 1,400 miles on ours, 12K/year allowance so already under the limit. That's funny about your wife not liking it, mine drives the Tacoma more than expected which is good because while I love the truck it is nice I don't have to wrestle the Acura from her.
4647	October 18, 2019 6:07PM	kyfdx	Close to 29K on ours, and not quite 28 months old, so over by about 1200-1500 miles, with 8 months to go.
4648	October 18, 2019 6:21PM	stickguy	If I got a PU of any Dort, I doubt my wife would ever want to drive it. Which could be an issue if I ever need her car.

4662	October 18, 2019 11:39PM	sda	I don’t recall if you’ve had a Q5 in the past, but we really like ours. It is beautifully put together, comfortable, quiet, drives great and is decently quick with the 2.0T. We do miss the room of the Pilot at times, but no regrets.

My friend at T's P put it in the computer today so since mine runs out tomorrow, we're in good shape. The price went up a bit but what stuff really comes down in price? He asked how long I plan on keeping the Golf and said at least a year but who really knows. The policy is transferable once so we're o k with that. But as long as the Golf is behaving, not looking to cut it from the herd yet. Do plan on testing a Corolla hatch and a Mini Cooper again just to see if they could work. At the Chevy dealer yesterday, saw a 2016 BMW 328i with just about 40K asking price was $18K. Car was a silver over black with the sports seats. Looked very clean and the CarFax is clean also. Figure the price is pretty good and the mileage per year ain't that bad. But do I really want a used vehicle with 40K on the odo as things will probably need changing soon enough considering I'm averaging around 13K/year with my small commute.
Still waiting on the Hyundai Venue to show up. Told it's been delayed because the new Sonata has been pushed back also and that one is coming out first. There's also the Hyundai Elantra GT but like the sportier model of that. Leaning towards a hatch again but that 328i keeps calling my name!!"

4670	October 19, 2019 4:24AM	breld	"I had an SQ5 of the previous generation and was certainly impressed with it, and not just for the extra power and sporty character.

So a Q5 like yours is high on my list.

Speaking of which..."
4671	October 19, 2019 4:31AM	breld	"I did get out this afternoon and drove these two vehicles:

https://www.audiflatirons.com/certified/Audi/2017-Audi-Q5-5725e5df0a0e0a6b739386e7ee467da5.htm

https://www.audiflatirons.com/used-inventory/index.htm?make=Mercedes-Benz&normalExteriorColor=&lastFacetInteracted=

The miles on the Q5 are a bit high, but it is certified. I really enjoyed driving it...it has a nice tight feel to it and accelerates nicely and is very responsive in sport mode. Compared to the A5, it’s obviously a bit outdated in the tech dept, but having owned several of the previous gen Audis, it was all very familiar...in a good way.

Didn’t someone here own a GLC (other than my wife’s 3 month experience)?

I really liked the GLC too. In a sea of black MBs, I like the bright blue. This one isn’t loaded with options, but has the ones I’d want - Burmester Sound, premium package, led lighting. For a 2018 with only 11k mikes, seems like a reasonable, if not good, price.

@qbrozen - what’s something like that going for at auction?"
4672	October 19, 2019 11:09AM	Sandman6472	"Drove in a new MB A Class today at work, we got 5 people in there! Drove very nicely and had ample power to move all of us quite briskly at times. Was a white over black unit. Saw another black over black unit at body damage later in the day. Starts at $33,400 which is a bit much for a base model. But think many will pay that and more to get their foot into the MB door. Would I...doubtful on a new unit...maybe on a lightly used unit.
But again, my garage side size leaves only a bunch of vehicles I can look at and then purchase. And leaving one vehicle outside everyday is just not going to happen here unless we move to a condo as we discussed the other day."
4673	October 19, 2019 11:43AM	ab348	"The thing with owning an ""economy"" luxe brand like M-B is that you still get to pay their high-end service rates once the warranty or service plan runs out. A friend was telling me of his recent sorry experience with his S-class W221 (I think it is a 2011 model). He complained of a rattle up front when turning the steering wheel. Dealer diagnosed it as a bad front control arm. $1200 later he had a new control arm but the rattle remained. He took it back and the dealer said it must be the arm on the opposite side and advised another $1200 repair. He resisted and complained that they had done an unnecessary replacement and wasn't going to let that happen again. Finally a different mechanic at the dealer went over it more carefully and found 3 loose bolts somewhere in the front end. Tightening them eliminated the rattle but he was still out the $1200."

4675	October 19, 2019 12:20PM	stickguy	"the blue on that MB really is something. The Audi is attractive, but the interior tech is a bit old fashioned. Kinda reminds me of a better quipped version of our RDX. At this point unless I was shopping the really cheap end of the spectrum (like QB with the Equinox) I don't want to get a prior generation model and regret not having the latest goodies. My wife even comments that the RDX looks/smells like an ""old car"" now. But she still likes it (paid for, and she knows how to use everything, since there is not much to use).

Same dilemma I had with the Volvo V60CC I found (2018). Compared to the new models, it looked like an antique inside. But it was a lot cheaper! Just hard to commit to something for a long time, if it already feels outdated at the beginning."
4676	October 19, 2019 1:12PM	nyccarguy	"@breld - I really like that Q5. Very sharp color combination. I am curious as to the Audi CPO warranty:

* Limited Warranty: 12 Month/Unlimited Mile beginning after new car warranty expires or from certified purchase date

You are only going to have it for a few months anyway, so what is the difference how long the CPO warranty is?"
4677	October 19, 2019 2:17PM	mjfloyd1	"MB CPO is unlimited miles and you can choose 1,2 or 3 years for extra cost. No deductible.

I happen to like green. Would happily buy another BRG shade."
4681	October 19, 2019 3:32PM	ab348	For me, the black interior on that M-B is a bigger turn off than the blue outside, though it does look a bit bright an un-Mercedes-like.
4682	October 19, 2019 3:34PM	stickguy	the Germans really do know how to make a black interior particularly dour. I have no desire to go down that path.
4683	October 19, 2019 5:02PM	Sandman6472	"I love my silk blue color on the Golf, don't see to many of them either and goes well with the ivory interior. I still really really like it and though was pretty pissed at the price to fix the front drivers door lock, it drives very smoothly and by putting the gear selector in ""S"" mode when merging into traffic, it does away with that slight turbo lag it has. The rpm's go down once I shift back into ""D"" mode and all is well. That turbo lag is quite annoying though and my only real complaint after almost 5 years of ownership.
Stopped by Tires Plus on the way in this morning and paid for the new 3-year alignment policy, a 4 wheel alignment, and it was $129 plus taxes and fees. Transferable to another vehicle one time which should work out just fine. I'd say at this point that within a couple of years, I'll have something else parked where ever we are at that time. Will be hitting 60K before weeks end which still puts me at about 12,500/year mileage, give or take. Just hoping nothing big goes wrong within the next 18 or so months.
But honestly, if I do find something that really blows my socks off between now and then, of course I'd swoop in and buy it. But it's gonna have to put that sh-t eating grin on my face like the Golf did during my first test drive. I knew within about 5 minutes that this was gonna be mine one day though it happened much sooner than I actually thought. No regrets even now. And the new Eagle GT's make it ride super smooth especially in the recent downpours we've been having...feel very secure in all kinds of driving truthfully. Probably would've ended up with Firestone Firehawk GT's if I had bought at Tires Plus but extremely happy with what I've got now."
4684	October 19, 2019 5:26PM	fintail	"I pity the fool who takes an out of warranty aging MB to a dealer for major repairs. These cars are why good indy shops exist. Those cars probably have more plumbing and wiring than the average house, and at the same time can be like caring for a stone Victorian era mansion built on a slumping hillside (and W221 is worlds easier to live with than a W220).

You are right though, old ones cost as much to maintain as new ones, just because they age doesn't mean they lose complexity. The price paid for pioneering bleeding edge tech."
4685	October 19, 2019 5:28PM	fintail	It'll be closer to 40K (MSRP anyway, and with these going into fleets, they won't sell near that) equipped like most would want. I do like how the LED gauges are standard. I'd expect depreciation like a CLA.
4686	October 19, 2019 5:55PM	rny421	That's me! We have a 2017 GLC - black on black. $33K seems very fair, as we paid $38K in 2018. So far it's been reliable - only one issue that required two trips to the dealer because the part was on backorder. I am still worried about the long-term reliability of it though, so will most likely get the extended warranty for $1,750.
4687	October 19, 2019 6:17PM	marcogallo1986	I know those bright blues I Toyota uses some other brands not crazy about them.

4693	October 19, 2019 6:34PM	marcogallo1986	@ Send a man, kind of figured purchased a radio doesn’t affect any other systems on the car, and yeah it’s just I think that Chevy has a deal with with the warranty, but figured I’d ask you never know. Ha ha but I’m glad it’s a good car for her. Yeah I remember you mentioning about that Porsche a couple of months back to me to smile that’s only car besides the golf team drive daily. Have to see on that venue want to check it out to when it comes out just cause I can. Hopefully maybe by the beginning of next year or the end of this year. It will come out!

4703	October 20, 2019 12:40AM	breld	"Did do a good amount of browsing today with @jpp75 and @michaell...
Grand Cherokee - drove a 2016 Overland model (V6). Love the rugged looks of the Jeep and the somewhat ""raw"" feel of the naturally aspirated V6 (like my first Durango). There's a lot to like in the Jeep, but not sure I want one out of warranty, much less with the air suspension.
X5 (xdrive 40e) - these PHEV models seems to be coming back from lease and at attractive prices. Not surprisingly, since we liked our previous X5, I found this very familiar (in a good way). A top choice for sure. Unfortunately, when you go back a few years, BMW was a bit stingy on safety features like BLIS, so hard to find a 2016-2017 model with those things.
X3 - took a 2019 (slightly used) model out. It's nice, but for my needs, I don't need to spend that much for the new model. I'd rather spend less on an older Q5 or the GLC.
Honda Passport - as expected, very functional. Drove very smooth. Just not that exciting. But a nice package for about the same price as a 3 year old X5.
All that just got me more undecided on whether I want to go with something a bit larger, like the X5, Passport or Grand Cherokee, or stick with the compacts I've been considering (Q5, GLC...maybe an XC60?)."
4704	October 20, 2019 12:48AM	stickguy	"New XC60 is very nice. But a lot more expensive then the prior generation since they are a big upgrade, and don't go very far back.

I really want to try out an X3. Something like you drove (maybe a service loaner) to help with the budget. For us though, it would be the primary do everything car, and a long term hold. I did park next to a prior version and it was nice, but I think the newest ones are a lot nicer. It is on the short list.

wife nixed the Passport. Too big and bulky. we definitely aren't going up into that larger class (well, OB is longer, but still a more compact car if that makes sense!)"
4705	October 20, 2019 1:17AM	breld	The X3 we drove was good looking - phytonic blue with a mocha interior. Very rich. Definitely lacked one thing you couldn't live without @stickguy - no sunroof!
4706	October 20, 2019 1:21AM	qbrozen	Just to throw a curveball... if I was looking at a V6 cherokee and passport, I’d at least take a gander at a Blazer.
4707	October 20, 2019 1:34AM	roadburner	"I drove an X5 xDrive40e quite a bit when I worked at BMW; I could average 30 mpg with judicious use of the various power modes. Too big for me however.
If I was buying an SUV to replace the 2er(fat chance) it would definitely be either an X3 M40i or an X3 M Competition."
4708	October 20, 2019 1:40AM	Michaell	"Long day, as @breld noted. My head hurt when it was all said and done, and I'm not even doing the shopping.

We decided that the interior by Playskool nixed the Blazer. In addition to the BMW and Honda stores- next to each other, how convenient - we also stopped at a CarMax and saw the V90 CC that was posted a week or so back. Beautiful car, marred by an odd exterior color. Wandered the lot, then I think we all hit a wall."
4709	October 20, 2019 1:43AM	Michaell	"I was fortunate enough to drive the A5 home from CarMax - I got picked up this morning. That is one nice car, but I sort of understand why the exchange may happen - it's like a bigger, slightly softer, automatic version of the GTI.

More diversity in the fleet is a good thing."
4710	October 20, 2019 1:44AM	corvette	Where there's a breld, there's a way! I can't imagine a small inconvenience like a vacation or a dealership being closed would stand in the way of you making a deal.
4711	October 20, 2019 1:47AM	corvette	"My mom is not really a car enthusiast. Her comment on the previous generation XC60, before they bought their Q5, was ""if we can buy a brand new one for half of MSRP, I'd be willing to take it."""
4712	October 20, 2019 2:00AM	breld	"As evidenced by some recent purchases here on the board, Audi did really well with the Q5. I wasn't shocked, but a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed the drive of the previous gen model yesterday. The new one naturally has some nice updates on the interior and tech options, but the overall driving experience is not noticeably better (which simply speaks well of the old version, which has been around for quite awhile).

The 2.0T had enough power, but my target could be the not as ubiquitous 3.0T version - the engine from my Q7 in the more compact package could be very engaging."
4713	October 20, 2019 2:23AM	stickguy	I might swing the wife by the Audi dealer to scope one out. I doubt she would ever go with it. Not a big VW or Audi fan to start with, and I am not sure I want to commit to one for 8-10 years. Cost is the other issue. Pricey to buy new, and not a cheap lease either. So that leaves buying CPO, which seem to still be on the expensive side, and she really would prefer brand new.
4714	October 20, 2019 4:10AM	fintail	"Around here anyway, for routine servicing, the dealer and a good indy might indeed be similarly priced, and the dealer might even be a better deal as it will be faster (I seldom wait more than 2 hours at the dealer, while the indy is ""we'll do it when we do it""). But for any real repairs, I think the labor rate at the indy is significantly less, it adds up. My local dealer is Autonation, who has had immense employee turnover since it changed hands from a family business, where I've been going to the indy for nearly 15 years, all that matters too."
4715	October 20, 2019 12:15PM	mjfloyd1	"@breld- have fun on your cruise!

You are a car buying machine - the epitome of CCBA!

I can only imagine what I would be like if I lived where there were so many car dealerships with nice cars but alas I live in a town of 60,000 plus 40,000 college students so I have my choice of Audi, VW, Subadoo, Honda, Hyundai, Chevy, GMC, Cadillac, KIA, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Ford, Lincoln, Chrysler, Jeep, Toyota, Mazda, or Volvo.

So only high end is Audi. They still have 9 2019 Q7 on the lot with over $9000 discount so I’m assuming that the 2020 vehicles are on the way. Is it just me or are the new model year cars showing up later?"
4716	October 20, 2019 12:57PM	qbrozen	So you did look at a Blazer? Any other opinions? I haven’t seen the inside of one yet.
4717	October 20, 2019 2:06PM	mjfloyd1	"I wondered the same. I saw one on the road and it looked pretty nice.

The description of “playskool” interior gives me pause"
4718	October 20, 2019 2:20PM	nyccarguy	Which platform is the Blazer built on? Is it an Equinox? Malibu?
4719	October 20, 2019 2:27PM	qbrozen	C1 platform that debuted in 2017 on the XT5 and is under the Acadia as well.
4720	October 20, 2019 2:27PM	stickguy	"I think the Blazer is on the Equinox platform. But don't make me swear to it. Pretty sure though it is just a butched up soft roader (like the Passport off the Pilot).

I thought that the Blazer kinda stole the Camaro interior look? But in any case, not something you are buying because you want the look and feel of an Audi or Volvo.

Floyd, you broke Lincoln and Cadillac's heart not counting them as high end!"
4721	October 20, 2019 2:38PM	mjfloyd1	@stickguy- I’m good with that!
4722	October 20, 2019 3:01PM	breld	We didn't look at or drive the Blazer. It's not something on my radar, but @jpp75 and @michaell took a close look at it at the car show earlier this year and were (obviously) unimpressed.
4723	October 20, 2019 3:03PM	breld	"Thanks (regarding the cruise)!

Not so much a buying machine this year, but I take that as a good sign that I may be getting a little less crazy and impulsive. Unfortunately, it probably has more to do with my consumer instincts being consumed for most of the year with the home buying and moving process."
4724	October 20, 2019 3:06PM	breld	"@mjfloyd1 - so how is the experience thus far with the Q7? Despite choosing to trade mine in, I still think it's about the best SUV out there.

It'd be easy to make the argument that I should have kept the Q7 and traded the A5 for the wife's Alltrack. But I think I'd still be in the same place - with the change in my driving routine and virtually no need for the 3rd row anymore, I'd be looking to reduce our car debt with a less expensive SUV anyway.

But man, that Q7 was a dream."
4725	October 20, 2019 3:15PM	mjfloyd1	The Q7 was great driving back home. It is for my wife and she is happy so now I have a chance at happiness
4726	October 20, 2019 3:20PM	stickguy	so if the Q7 was too much car/money, doesn't make much sense to be looking at an X5. The Q5 seems to be where this is headed (though a nice X3 for some variety sounds good too!)
4727	October 20, 2019 3:24PM	mjfloyd1	"As a proud dad moment, my oldest got a 1350 SAT which is good but looking at merit scholarships, the cutoff for another approx $5K per year was 1360 so she took it again and scored a 1360. They allow you to group your best math and best English scores and her new “super score” is 1420.

Also found out that she is a finalist for the Eli Lilly endowment scholarship for our county in IN so she has a 20% chance at a full tuition paid for four years to any public or private college / university in IN. That would be great but I’m not counting on it as there are 9 other great candidates. She has an interview next week!"
4728	October 20, 2019 3:26PM	corvette	And Volvo!
4729	October 20, 2019 3:32PM	mjfloyd1	My wife did think the XC90 was nice, but thought the Q7 was “sportier”. I don’t get that at all, but the Q7 was what she wanted so that’s what I got.
4730	October 20, 2019 3:36PM	stickguy	a full scholarship to a school you want to go to anyway would be amazing. Even a bit extra like $5k is a nice bonus.
4731	October 20, 2019 3:37PM	kyfdx	"Congrats on the SAT score!

Unfortunately, they have to perform, once they get there. Our scholarship joy only lasted one year."
4732	October 20, 2019 3:39PM	breld	That's great! Congrats!
4733	October 20, 2019 3:41PM	breld	"Maybe. Cost-wise, these CPO X5's off lease return are up to $10k less than what my Q7 was worth on trade, so a reasonable step down in that way.

Then I'm thinking...hey, if a Q5 is too similar to the GTI in driving dynamics, maybe the answer is to get the Q5 and change up the fun car...like maybe an M235i or something!

Oh, the wheels never stop spinning."
4734	October 20, 2019 3:56PM	mjfloyd1	"Ugh

It looks like she needs to keep a 3.5 to keep the merit scholarship at the schools. I honestly wasn’t expecting the Lilly to be in play so I have not even checked into that.

She takes AP and honors courses and has a 4.2 on a 4 point scale while being the #1 golfer and is on the cheer and competitive cheer teams. She already has some college credit from taking the exams for her AP courses. She seems to have a good head on her shoulders and knows that she wants to go to a smallish school near home so it looks like DePauw in Greencastle IN (although I think she would be bored out of her head there) or Butler in Indy. My wife is taking her to a cheer clinic at Butler today.

Time will tell what she chooses. It appears that DePauw is better with merit scholarships and she has many friends there, but Butler has a PA school so..."
4735	October 20, 2019 3:59PM	stickguy	Well, to me, a better plan is to keep the GTI and go with a hot rod X3 if the 2.0t isn't enough for you.
4736	October 20, 2019 4:00PM	mjfloyd1	"I am slowly learning to buy what I like and keep it. I used to read car magazines all the time and get “car envy”, but I’m older and hopefully wiser. But I still do stupid things well just because I can, I guess

Here is a link to where I bought the Q7. They seem to be pretty high volume. The sales lady said they get lots of lease returns and recently got some really low mileage vehicles from customers who could not afford the notes. That’s sad.

4737	October 20, 2019 4:05PM	stickguy	"I want to do stupid things. Just can't afford it! Keeping long term does have some benefits. Usually financial of course. But also less stress with searching and buying! the wife in particular likes that, since she gets stressed having to learn all new controls and tech. And the new stuff in particular might be too much for her. She hasn't figured out much of what the TLX does, and that is pretty straight forward for a loaded car these days. So she just drives it without touching anything!

key is, make sure you are getting something really nice and not compromising, so you don't get tired of it right away. And buy something that will last."
4738	October 20, 2019 4:07PM	mjfloyd1	@breld. - I can tell you that taking a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon to Chicago vs driving the Q7 from Atlanta was a night and day comparison. They wanted the GL to have less than 95K miles for some odd reason...

I went to the University of Evansville undergrad and kind of hoped that she would go there because they have direct admit to PA school or IU school of medicine if you keep your gpa up - assuming MCAT or Grad school testing scores are up to snuff.

But the facilities don’t compare to DePauw or Butler...

She never used the cruise contral or navigation in her former Forester. I don't know what else, but I suspect she never used the remote start either."

She can't stop herself from putting her thumb on that dimple when she is getting into the car. So, it unlocks and then re-locks as she is pulling the handle. Rinse and repeat a few times until she realizes what she is doing wrong. Naturally, without question it's the car's fault."

4783	October 21, 2019 6:50PM	28firefighter	The Tuscon does not lease well at all, either.
4784	October 21, 2019 6:59PM	tjc78	"I'm just not a huge fan of the Rogue.. and they are CVT too, right? She may never even notice, so probably wouldn't matter.

I haven't run #s on a Tucson. I remember getting a pretty solid deal on one for a buddy of mine but that was over a year ago and certainly programs have changed."
4785	October 21, 2019 7:00PM	stickguy	Rav 4 is CVT now isn’t it? Not sure if Tucson switched over yet.
4786	October 21, 2019 7:05PM	Michaell	What is it about the RAV4 that appeals to her? Better visibility? AWD? Toyota reliability?
4787	October 21, 2019 7:08PM	tjc78	"av 4 is CVT now isn’t it?

No it's an 8 Speed."
4788	October 21, 2019 7:11PM	tjc78	"She hasn't had anything but a Toyota since the late 90s when we she gave up her 96 Thunderbird. She does like her current RAV and told me she likes the new style.

I'm going to show her some things tonight. Personally I think she can come down a size class. She only ever has one passenger or my kids in the back.

Not many decently equipped SUVs hitting mid 300s with only first month OOP it seems."
4789	October 21, 2019 7:15PM	corvette	If the lease programs are that awful, would she be better off buying and possibly keeping it longer than 36 months?
4790	October 21, 2019 7:17PM	corvette	Weirdly, after I cancelled Onstar, the red light indicating a system malfunction went out, so I think it's at least getting a cell signal... Still no Bluetooth, though, so I'm still guessing there's something bad in the module.
4791	October 21, 2019 7:19PM	stickguy	But out the current one and keep it forever. Problem solved.
4792	October 21, 2019 7:54PM	carnaught	
4793	October 21, 2019 8:02PM	tjc78	"All solid suggestions guys! She really likes having a new car and can afford it so probably going to stay on the hampster wheel!

I’ve thought about the Encore, nice little Ute. I like the Equinox and Terrian as well. There usually can be deals on those."
4794	October 21, 2019 8:08PM	28firefighter	"I'm looking at a GLA250 loaner for my in-laws. MB doesn't hit the residual if it has less than 3000 miles.

I'm getting a $1200 OOP and $310/month including 10.5% tax and crazy WA registration fees for a $41k GLA. I hate the car but it hits all the things they wanted..."
4795	October 21, 2019 8:48PM	stickguy	"I would drive a GLA for that money.

Tom, is it that crucial to hit a certain price point? I know I always go through this, and eventually (within reason of course) end up going with something I actually want, even if it is a little more money. If you are willing to do the lease after lease plan, saving money can't be the #1 requirement, so if $50/month is not going to be noticeable in the long run, get whatever it is that she really wants.

Just about everyone here at one point has shopped and taken a ""deal"", and ended up regretting it (or at least, hated the car for the duration).

at least the new RAV is a lot sharper looking than the old ones. Seems bigger too but that could be an illusion. Someone in my neighborhood just got a white limited, and it is actually pretty sharp."
4796	October 21, 2019 8:58PM	Michaell	"I'll admit I like the looks of the current RAV4 as well.

But, AWD is not a ""need to have""?

The next size down for Toyota would be the CH-R.

A neighbor across the street from me just got a Kona - in white. Not the most favorable color, with the black wheel arches. But, I like the concept of it.

With a 3 years lease, long term reliability isn't that big of a concern.

A GLA for $310/mo would be pretty good.

The Nissan Kicks packs a lot of features into a pretty reasonable price - if you can live with FWD only."
4797	October 21, 2019 9:01PM	28firefighter	The GLA is not for me - at $40k, it has halogen headlights and no Nav, which is mindblowing to me. But it hits the requirements in other areas - power passenger seat (hard to find), dual zone climate control (hard to find in entry trims), CarPlay etc.
4798	October 21, 2019 9:08PM	stickguy	"if it comes with Carplay, I don't care about not having Navi built in.

and from Mom, I bet that she would never know it had FWD instead of AWD. I know my wife never would on her RDX (and quite possibly, neither would I!)

so going with the FWD cheaper model makes sense.

the Kona is really nice, but definitely smaller. But roomy enough for me."
4799	October 21, 2019 9:31PM	ab348	"I like the Kona too in certain colors - as Michaell says, they have a lot of black plastic on the exterior (son of Aztek?) and it doesn't look great in light colors. I prefer the Kia Niro in terms of looks.

A Sportage is a step up but I have no idea what those go for."
4800	October 22, 2019 12:56AM	jpp75	I had a new RAV4 for a rental in Houston this week. I think it was an XLE. I like the looks and while it wasn't anything exciting to drive it was more than competent.
4801	October 22, 2019 2:36AM	28firefighter	Looks like my in laws will end up with a GLA. It’s a former loaner with P01 Premium, Smartphone Pack, and matte wood trim. MSRP is just over $40k so fairly stripped.
4802	October 22, 2019 12:43PM	corvette	Whatever floats their boat. Are these in laws the ones who planned to borrow your spare car, when you had one--don't they live out of town?
4803	October 22, 2019 1:30PM	fintail	Matte dark wood I bet, it's always that blackish wood.
4804	October 22, 2019 2:10PM	28firefighter	Yes, but they're here WAY more than they originally had planned - initial thought was 6-8 weeks a year. So far this year it's been like 17 or 18. Which is great for Sam and getting lots of family time, but untenable for us in terms of sharing.
4805	October 22, 2019 2:54PM	Michaell	"Wouldn't it be less expensive for them to rent a car when they are in Seattle?

The way I'm looking at it is this - $310/mo for 12 months is $3720. Divide that by the 18 weeks they are in town and that's just over $200/week. I'm sure they could rent something for that rate.

Not to mention insurance and storage costs.

What am I missing here?"
4806	October 22, 2019 3:07PM	28firefighter	"They ran the numbers and came to the conclusion they could not.

In the off season $200/week is doable. But from May-September during cruise season, rentals can run as high as $500/week, esp for an SUV. They're here quite a bit during the summer."
4807	October 22, 2019 3:12PM	Michaell	"Do they need to rent an SUV?

Hey, it's not my money, and I've got no skin in the game, I'm just genuinely curious.

But, I'm glad Sam gets to see his grandparents as much as he does. I only saw my paternal grandparents a handful of times in my life - I grew up in CA, while they lived in NY."
4808	October 22, 2019 3:15PM	ab348	@28firefighter , where will the car be stored when they are not in Seattle?
4809	October 22, 2019 3:16PM	28firefighter	"Believe me - I've had this same conversation because I think its a bit much, but their perception is they need an SUV to ""move things.""

I'm glad he gets so much time with them - but its hard, as he only sees my parents in person a few times a year. Thankfully we FaceTime 4-5 times a week with them and my siblings, but it is still hard."
4810	October 22, 2019 3:16PM	28firefighter	In their condo garage - which is why I lost my Saab parking space.

4814	October 22, 2019 3:29PM	nyccarguy	How much is one of these new? $50K?
4815	October 22, 2019 3:46PM	28firefighter	Closer to 60k, I think, depending on options.
4816	October 22, 2019 4:34PM	kyfdx	"I’d guess closer to $50K in 2016.

Price seems high to me, for a 4 yr old car..

Of course, I want RWD and a stick..."
4817	October 22, 2019 6:04PM	nyccarguy	"Then it would be more expensive due to the fact that it is a ""RARE 6-SPEED!"" + ""LOW MILEAGE!"" + ""EXTRA CLEAN!"" + ""CERTIFIED!"""
4818	October 22, 2019 6:07PM	qbrozen	Seemed high to me, too, but auction results are about $29k. Yikes.
4819	October 22, 2019 6:23PM	jmonroe1	"HUH? How much darker do you want it? If it was any darker it would be black. I call that 'old man's gray'. I otta know because my '15 Genny is that color also has a black interior. Being in that thing is like being in a cave when someone turned off the lights. I don't like it to this day but I ain't getting rid of it anytime soon, it just turned 8,600 miles yesterday. Mrs. j would kill me if I even mentioned that.

jmonroe"
4820	October 22, 2019 6:27PM	Sandman6472	"That gray 328i is gone already which is not surprising. Great price with average miles for the year. Car looked very clean though I never even got to sit in it. I knew before Stick said anything that it's a bit too long for my requirements and I still prefer a hatch right now, very versatile for my needs currently.
Got to drive the kids Cruze last night and I like it. It does everything she needs...and then some and is nicely equipped. Think the 18"" alloys are a bit overkill but they do look great. She's thrilled with it and getting excellent mpg's!"
4821	October 22, 2019 6:35PM	pensfan83	If the price is right I'm not going to protest too much but I'd really like to move away from a black interior after the Acura goes back. I may or may not have mentioned this before but the last non-black interior I had was my 4th gen Accord.
4822	October 22, 2019 6:41PM	kyfdx	I need black carpets. Beige interior with beige carpet and beige dash? No thanks.
4823	October 22, 2019 6:51PM	stickguy	"I keep saying no more black interiors. then I get another one. I rationalized this one because it is Alcantara seating surfaces. And has some red trim (Elantra did too). Plus, that was the only way to get it (wife was never approving the lipstick red leather).

I do like the dark carpets and lower dash, with lighter seats and upper dash and headliner. That is a good mix"
4824	October 22, 2019 7:22PM	pensfan83	I couldn't do that combo either but I would like at least a splash of some color whether it be seating surfaces, headliner, dash, etc. If I could have customized my car I would have taken a TLX in red with black carpets, but the espresso leather and lighter headliner.
4825	October 22, 2019 7:25PM	laurasdada	I'm gonna look for non-black interior next, too. While my XF has black, it's a bit broken up by a wide swath of aluminium and wood veneer on the dash and doors. Lighter headliner, too, so not as sepulchral as black interiors of many BMWs, MBs, Porsche and Audis I've seen.
4826	October 22, 2019 7:55PM	nyccarguy	If it was any darker it would be black Exactly! That's what I want!
4827	October 22, 2019 8:00PM	kyfdx	My wife's car has black carpets and dash, and a caramel color leather seating. Looks great, I think.
4828	October 22, 2019 8:10PM	ab348	"DOWN WITH BLACK INTERIORS!!! Who's with me?!?

I was actually pleased to see a very nice, very light interior (with some black accents incl. carpets) in the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride."
4829	October 22, 2019 8:35PM	tjc78	"That looks just like my car interior.

First car I had like that was my 09 Genesis. I too like the dark carpets, light seats and dash."
4830	October 22, 2019 8:54PM	Sandman6472	"The new Hyundai Revue will be out soon, saw it on a commercial last night. I'm kinda interested in it also to be honest. Especially the ""denim edition"" model. A bit smaller than what Ive got now but has that ""cheap to keep"" that I'm after. The long warranty is nice to.
Drove a 2019 Tucson yesterday afternoon and it had push button start. Drove very nicely but prefer the looks of the Sportage. The Rogue Sport is o k, a co-worker's wife has one in gray over black and it's a good looking CUV. Like the Kicks also and do plan to drive one soon. The CH-R has a pretty large blind spot in back and pretty dark with the black interior, a lighter interior might brighten things up.
I'd love a new Rav4 but again, a bit too big for my size requirements I'm thinking. And keep in mind on the GLA, it's pretty damn thirsty and I brought mine back to Enterprise after 3 days and got a Rav4 which was better with the petrol.
Have discussed leasing but still doing around 13K/year of driving so makes more sense to buy. Will be at around 61K by December 12th, when I'll have had my current Golf for five years."
4831	October 22, 2019 9:02PM	Sandman6472	My Golf has a similar interior and love it. A few smallish marks in almost five years but not too bad really. A black pleather interior down here in South Florida is super hot in the long summers we have and one tends to sweat a lot very quickly. My ivory seats don't do this and are much more comfortable. I don't mind a gray interior either but if it's all black, it's not coming home with me.

I actually want a better set-up to create an extra off street parking spot that does not block the garage."
4834	October 22, 2019 10:01PM	Sandman6472	Want to downsize but keep a 2-car garage. Minimal lawn for lawn guy to cut. Still keep two vehicles. And enough parking when the kids come home for weekends/vacations. Would like a 3/2.5 with around 1500 square feet, condo or house. Probably stay in Florida but west coast or around Orlando. Spend around $260K, give or take.
4835	October 22, 2019 10:31PM	tifighter	The X has black leather with carbon fiber inserts, and a black alcantara headliner. It avoids cave status by having a ginormous windshield combined with glass on the roof. It actually looks pretty nice IMHO.

First they said ""go straight to your car"" but it turned out it wasn't mine, but some guy with the same name from TEXAS! My name isn't even that common! Then they claimed they were 150 cars short! Tried to set me up with some other off-brand company that was across two Interstates, and when I got out there they told me they would be closed on Xmas Day so we wouldn't be able to return their Daewoo then. Soooo they hauled us back to the airport, and instead of calling a hotel shuttle and dealing with car rental the next morning, I decided to try my luck as a walk-up and Budget had me leaving their lot in a car in 20 minutes. Thrifty sent me a check for the difference in rental costs, and a voucher for a free weekend rental which is the only other time I would ever use them. Since then I think I have rented a couple from Budget and one from Avis, but it's been almost entirely Hertz."

How’s everyone’s week been going? So far so good, Jim, job searching and making the best of every day.

4855	October 23, 2019 6:38AM	Sandman6472	"+2 Stick. Think my Golf would look just great in that same combo but the red VW uses is really more of a Candy Apple Red and didn't appeal to me at the time. To be fair, they didn't have a Golf SE or SEL in that color over the ivory when I was looking or I might've been tempted.
@Marco, have seen that same commercial on the tube but nothing in person. The Hyundai store is right across the street but nothing there or in their online inventory as of late. Again, the guys at the Hyundai store in Weston Florida that we service told me since the new 2020 Sonata was having some issues so it's debut was pushed back which pushed the start date of the 2020 being introduced. The Miami International Car Show starts on the 1st, a Friday which is also my 65th birthday, down at the Miami Convention Center. Seriously considering going this year, will be the first in many years. Plan on taking that day off, already got the green light, and going to the show. Did that back in 2009, the last show I attended as I recall. The wife mentioned coming with me but wold have to go on Saturday or Sunday. Not sure how serious she really is about joining me but if she really is, I'll just wait for her. Really want to see the new 2020 Hyundai Venue and the 2020 Honda HR-V...both on my short list. Sitting in the 2020 Toyota Corolla hatch rounds out the top 3 of that same list. Like the ""denim edition"" of the Venue and want all the safety nannies and a rocking audio system. I think one of these three vehicles cold make me trade my Golf in for it but we'll have to see after some extensive time behind the wheel. Am genuinely excited about these three vehicles and really the first time since I picked up the Golf in December of 2014. Really genuinely excited. Love the size and interior of the Honda in either the EX or EX-L models with an ivory interior.
But some good seat time behind each wheel is needed before I even think to pull the trigger on something new. A better plan is probably to wait till I finally retire from Hertz and then purchase one, be it a 2020 or 2021 model. My commute is averaging 13K/year which is a lot even though it's 98% highway plus the tolls I have on the nearby Sawgrass Expressway. Would rather not put that many miles on a brand new vehicle or even a loaner if I go in that direction."

If you want I can break it down for you..

Just post in the appropriate discussion."
4872	October 23, 2019 7:41PM	28firefighter	Actually seems pretty good - most desking software doesn't provide MF on the customer facing quotes because no one knows what to do with it.
4873	October 23, 2019 7:41PM	28firefighter	Also, that discount seems abysmal. 3250 overall including a $2k rebate?
4874	October 23, 2019 7:45PM	qbrozen	I'd have to say that's pretty helpful. You could easily back into the MF using those numbers.
4875	October 23, 2019 7:54PM	kyfdx	"Add the $650 acquisition fee.. Re-calculate the sales tax for the lease (that's a little harder to hit, exactly)
Go to the Santa Fe discussion, and ask for the money factor. Presto!"
4876	October 23, 2019 7:55PM	tjc78	"Yes, I could (and did) but wanted to see it structured with everything rolled in.

Here is the quote with all info. Agreed discount is dreadful and this is an awful lease as quoted. @kyfdx heading to the leasing forum to check MF, I have a feeling it's marked up."
4877	October 23, 2019 7:58PM	tjc78	Their math is spot on.. at least!
4878	October 23, 2019 8:02PM	kyfdx	Money factor markup adds approx $20/mo.
4879	October 23, 2019 8:14PM	tjc78	"Yeah, as @28firefighter has been telling me many of these similar models just don't lease well.

Backing into some numbers even with a 10% discount that puts me at $355 with just first DAS. Not getting 10% off a Hyundai before rebate"
4880	October 23, 2019 8:31PM	xwesx	Interest rates are on their way up, so that is going to reflect in leases as well. We cannot expect the lease rates of a couple years ago, or even last year, to apply in the current market. I'm sure there will be those that pop up now and again when manufacturers are just trying to give away a slumping model, but UVs are hot right now, and most of them are relatively new to the market (e.g., current or last model year introductions on their generation).
4881	October 23, 2019 8:41PM	tjc78	"Very true.

I asked the sales person if the MF was marked up. The response I got was My system automatically populates that from Hyundai Finance LOL"
4882	October 23, 2019 8:54PM	28firefighter	Yeah right. Automagically from the SM's desk.
4883	October 23, 2019 8:55PM	corvette	Quite a non-answer.
4884	October 23, 2019 9:00PM	xwesx	Oof. My brother just purchased a 2020 Camaro SS 1LE. He's been itching to make a move like this for years now, and he finally just had to pull the trigger.
4885	October 23, 2019 9:57PM	jmonroe1	"Hey wise guy, the Genny has an excellent wax job because I waxed it myself right around the time that Mrs. j got her Subie in April. The Subie has the wax job that the dealer gave it, not bad for the freebie it was, but not equal to what I do, so it has to be the color.

jmonroe"
4886	October 23, 2019 10:00PM	stickguy	good thing that the next car )CUV) is almost definitely going to be a purchase, not lease.
4887	October 23, 2019 11:29PM	tifighter	Just heard that the 3 will be getting another 5% power increase via an upcoming OTA update. X will get a 3% increase. Whew, I was really thinking they were underpowered.
4888	October 24, 2019 1:09AM	Sandman6472	"Kid's Cruze is at her local Chevy store in Orlando so they can figure out the issue with her infotainment system. Guys down here were a waste! But did find out that Chevy still owes her a free oil change so that's something. Guess the first one is supposed to be on GM's dime. The store she bought it at in New Smyrna Beach gave her her first one and never mentioned the free Chevrolet one. Turns out it does take synthetic oil and with her at about 11K on the clock, she's still got a good way to go until her next one. The oil life monitor shoes 53% oil life left on the current synthetic so she's going to wait until she gets down to either 15% or 10%. I'll be going there on December 23rd until the 29th, so maybe we'll just get 'er done then. She starts her new job on Tuesday, going back to Goodwill Industry's but in Osceola County. She's pretty excited as she did like working for them in Palm Beach County those few years.
About the Miami International Auto Show, haven't been in awhile due to my spinal issues, as it's hard to be getting in and out of all those vehicles but will make an effort to go on the 1st or the 2nd if my wife and middle girl wants to go. Her '08 Accent just hit 40K but hey, next month she'll have had it 11 years so having her sit in many different vehicles could maybe help her rule out some. She really likes her current Accent so I suggested she just get another one. Sure, she can afford a much more expensive vehicle but it's just an appliance to her and luckily her commute is maybe 10 minutes each way. For her, the long Hyundai warranty is a great thing. Did drive a brand new 2019 Kia Forte at work yesterday and came away quite impressed so either could work for her. She also doesn't want any vehicle drama since she lives an hour away from us and I hate getting phone calls that my car won't start. Luckily, she lives in a building with indoor parking."
4889	October 24, 2019 1:54AM	corvette	Nice! Is he in Alaska? That doesn't seem like a very Alaska-friendly car!
4890	October 24, 2019 2:54AM	suydam	And how! I just asked for a lease quote on a Nissan Leaf Plus and was shocked that the monthly payment was listed at $585, when I leased the Volt for a similar price in 2017 for $325! Ruled that out for sure. Now I’m thinking we will buy out the Volt, hold on to the Encore for another 3 years till we pay off the Volt, and then look at buying a used Leaf Plus coming off a lease (and selling the Encore). The residual for the current Leaf Plus is around $18,000 so that seems the way to go.
4891	October 24, 2019 2:57AM	stickguy	If I wanted to commit to a sedan long term, buying out the TLX in 2 years for right about $20K, when it only has low 20s miles most likely, might make more sense.
4892	October 24, 2019 3:08AM	Sandman6472	The Hyundai Ioniq is starting to look better and better to me. Just need to drive one to see if it can get out of it's own way. Want any vehicle to have some get up and go to be honest! Not that I drive fast, just want it to go when I push my right foot down!
4893	October 24, 2019 3:12AM	stickguy	not super fast 0-60, but a hybrid can be a different experience than you are used to. Instant torque off the line so snappy initial tip-in, but going to run out of steam at higher speeds.
4894	October 24, 2019 3:14AM	Sandman6472	We like Hyundai's and Kia's to be honest. The new Forte is a nice looking vehicle. And i like them to. And my kids Accent has been very reliable in the 11 years she's owned it. Only the brake light switch went out in year 4. Was in and out, back home within 4 hours. We live right across the street also. Also close to VW, Audi, Volvo, Chevrolet, Mazda, Toyota, BMW/Mini Cooper, Lexus & Mercedes. So much to chose from actually, really way too much. Much to choose from which is great.
4895	October 24, 2019 3:25AM	stickguy	"My 2 Hyundais (4 straight years of them) were both excellent cars, and very good values. No issues at all really with either one. A few recall/TSB for silly stuff on the Sonata, nothing on the Elantra in 14 months. I would have no qualms about getting another one, and we actually have the Santa Fe on our short list to take a look at. Could be a good compromise for us. Cheaper than a luxury nameplate, but snazzy looking, and fully loaded with goodies. And my wife should be able to handle using the tech!

the 10 years of warranty coverage will be nice too, since we would be looking to keep it that long."
4896	October 24, 2019 1:14PM	tjc78	"Both of our Elantras were completely perfect in the time we had them.. The 2009 Genesis certainly had some teething problems and stranded me twice. Kudos to Hyundai on that one they did fix it correctly with the help of corporate but I always was leary of it after.

I wouldn't hesitate to buy any of the Hyundai models, I think they are as reliable as any other brand now."
4897	October 24, 2019 2:25PM	carnaught	Amazing the strides in design and reliability Hyundai/Kia have made in a short time. Isn’t their 10. yr. warranty a powertrain one rather than bumper to bumper?
4898	October 24, 2019 2:38PM	benjaminh	A positive review for the all-new 2020 Sonata....
4899	October 24, 2019 2:46PM	stickguy	"5/60 is BtoB. The out to 10/100 power train.

Good enough for me."
4900	October 24, 2019 5:15PM	marcogallo1986	@ Sandman, that’s right I figured probably the spinal issues kept you from going all these years, I hope you’re able to go with the wife in the middle daughter this year though. Hey if she wants another accident on the road whatever she likes if she sees something at the auto show that she likes great. And eventually once the venue comes out, you definitely have to check them out. Nice on your older daughter going back to work with a goodwill starting Tuesday, but she worked couple years back and loved it. Well Sharee has 11,000 miles on the cruise how long has he had it not even a year right? Hard drama is hard to avoid who wants it but happen sometimes just life it’s a machine have to Put up with it at times unavoidable yet, some brands might have a little more than others but trust me we will do. We’ve been pretty lucky with Hyundai, my dad Senat is still going strong who has almost 200,000 miles on it and he drives it in the Bronx in New Jersey weekly. It’s a 2009, that we got in 2008 new. So he got his money‘s worth out of it, Peter off couple of years ago so eventually it’s going to buy something used some SUVE. He probably will go with Hyundai and Kia again I think as of right now but we’ll see. Kiersten out or use the RDX was saying my dad asked about the RDX are used one probably like what stick my house, I was looking online for him and found him a few nice cool mileage used ones too. So we shall see.
4901	October 24, 2019 5:16PM	marcogallo1986	@zwest Nice on your brother getting a new Camaro that he always wanted. He bought it or list it? Does he live in Alaska somewhere near you, or elsewhere?
4902	October 24, 2019 5:17PM	marcogallo1986	Yeah and all these lease numbers that people are getting these days are insane when is a buy a nice slightly used car you’re better off makes more sense. Probably always did just now more so than ever. or buy something that you can afford the monthly payments on paid off and keep it till the wheels fall off literally for a bunch of years. But it’s hard to do in here ha ha Ha.
4903	October 24, 2019 7:09PM	xwesx	"No, he is in North Carolina. He bought it as a ""weekender,"" so he can pick and choose the best times to use it. He has a Cruze for his daily driver.

Oh, and @marcogallo1986, he purchased. When he told me about it and shared details, I had to scrape my jaw off the floor."
4904	October 24, 2019 7:10PM	Sandman6472	Just came back from a lunch with my retired co-workers at the Boca Raton post office. Saw some folks I hadn't seen in over nine years and seems a whole larger group shows up monthly. About 15 of us came so the group is usually closer to thirty folks. Lots of laughter and catching up. Saw a couple folks I didn't care for way back then but was cordial so all was good. A nice way to spend a couple of hours. Seems like I'm in the minority as I'm still holding down a part time gig, most of the others just enjoy their lives having fun or attending to family business. A few are dealing with older parents that need care from them so glad we're past that as I know from experience, it ain't easy when the parent becomes the kid again. I thank G-d for my Hertz gig after hearing some of their stories!
4905	October 24, 2019 9:40PM	qbrozen	YESSS!!! New tool arrived today. Used it to tell the Chevy about its new steering angle sensor and now all is right with its brain and zero warnings or codes are present. Woohoo!! Gotta wonder what the neighbors think when they see a man in his driveway with his arms up in the air in triumph.
4906	October 24, 2019 10:12PM	Michaell	Signaling a touchdown?
4907	October 24, 2019 10:48PM	corvette	@qbrozen what tool was that?
4908	October 24, 2019 11:09PM	xwesx	Fantastic! That is such a great feeling. Congrats!
4909	October 25, 2019 12:07AM	qbrozen	"I got the Foxwell NT510.
https://www.foxwelltech.com/product/item-169.html
$129 brand new from ebay"
4910	October 25, 2019 12:22AM	pensfan83	That's what I have as well! Only used it once so far but it seems pretty intuitive.
4911	October 25, 2019 1:27AM	qbrozen	It was easy enough to poke around in, but I was getting worried it would not do what I needed. Took me about 20 mins of methodically clicking through each menu to find the SAS. I know it reports to the BCM, but it was not in that menu of this tool. I forget now where it was, I believe maybe the transmission menu, of all places. I know it isn’t a prepopulated menu, and the tool is only reporting back what it finds as it scans modules, but I’d venture a guess what it was translating as “transmission” was not the transmission at all. Something along those lines.
4912	October 25, 2019 1:38AM	stickguy	that tool is cool. I should get one. Other than the fact that I have no actual need for it, and probably would never use it. But that never stopped me before!
4913	October 25, 2019 2:37AM	corvette	Hmm, how does that compare to the Bluedriver I bought a week or so ago? I know the Bluedriver doesn't do programming (like the Foxwell does), but does have repair information available for specific codes. Does the Foxwell let you get into the various specific modules like the Bluetooth/Onstar? I had a VAG-COM back when I had my first Jetta, and you could capture a lot of data and do a lot of programming with it.
4914	October 25, 2019 2:51AM	roadburner	I have the same scanner loaded with BMW/Mini?RR software. Between it and the Carly app I can scan, diagnose, and code- as well as register batteries, reset AT adaptations, etc.
4915	October 25, 2019 3:38AM	28firefighter	"Another CL find locally:
https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/cto/d/tacoma-1997-honda-prelude-5066-miles-sh/7005786623.html"
4916	October 25, 2019 3:44AM	fintail	As that era comes into its own, that Prelude might not be a crazy thing to buy and hold. I notice it was sold new locally, too.
4917	October 25, 2019 3:52AM	28firefighter	I just can’t help but think it’s wasted sitting that much. But yes, I think this would be one to hold. It’s basically a Honda museum piece.
4918	October 25, 2019 4:17AM	qbrozen	That is pretty much the difference. I needed the ability to register sensors.
4919	October 25, 2019 5:08AM	nyccarguy	I wish my car still looked like that. Wow!
4920	October 25, 2019 11:18AM	pensfan83	That's my thought. The car is a blast to drive but I'd be afraid of driving that anywhere.
4921	October 25, 2019 11:51AM	stickguy	"Bradd, if you never street parked it and only drove about 230 miles per year, it would!

seems like a waste, and at that price, something for a museum. So no reason for any normal person on CL to buy it.

That one seems like a BaT special."
4922	October 25, 2019 11:57AM	ab348	"I see it still has its original tires, which makes me wonder if it still has its original engine oil and coolant as well. Do these have a cam belt? If so it is no doubt original as well.

Could be great, or could be a time bomb I suppose."
4923	October 25, 2019 12:00PM	tjc78	"Buy it, put in garage, rub it with a diaper.

The minute you start driving it the value goes down and things break.

Agreed BAT would fetch stupid money for that car."

4926	October 25, 2019 1:00PM	corvette	I cross shopped the M37/M56 before I bought the G. The flat seats on the larger car killed it for me. If I wanted to slide off the edge of my seat, I'd take an aggressive corner in the Tahoe.
4927	October 25, 2019 2:05PM	fintail	"That's the dilemma. If you want a gem that might appreciate, you have to waste it. This car with 200K, even in pristine condition, is worth a fraction. But it won't get the oohs and aahs this thing will bring in another 5-10 years.

And yeah, I'd bet a lot this has a timing belt, maybe something to look into to be safe."
4928	October 25, 2019 2:06PM	kyfdx	Very sad that no one got to enjoy driving that vehicle... and, now, they never will.
4929	October 25, 2019 2:07PM	fintail	Last updated when, 2010/11? Infiniti letting a product age out again, without CUVs they'd be gone. I see more late model Rolls-Royce than these larger models , I am astounded the sales figures passed 3 digits, and I am suspicious of the claim. The real rarity is the LWB model, answering a question for the US market asked by the Chinese market, a hen's tooth.
4930	October 25, 2019 2:52PM	corvette	@qbrozen hmm... I'm going to return the Bluedriver to Amazon and may check the Foxwell out.
4931	October 25, 2019 2:54PM	corvette	The QX80 I rented in Tampa is their flagship SUV and did not have CarPlay or blind spot monitoring.
4932	October 25, 2019 3:06PM	28firefighter	It's funny. I love looking at time piece cars in museums and at car shows, but cannot imagine being the person who owns it and basically never drives it. Perhaps because I'll never view any car as an investment and always as a depreciating asset meant to be used up.
4933	October 25, 2019 3:20PM	tjc78	"The QX80 I rented in Tampa is their flagship SUV and did not have CarPlay or blind spot monitoring.

Infiniti is stingy with the BSM, you almost always need to have a fully loaded example to get it. IMO that should be made standard equipment on anything in that class of vehicle."
4934	October 25, 2019 3:44PM	marcogallo1986	20 fire fighter, wow that’s a rare find but I wouldn’t want it, you got to enjoy these cars not let him sit like that that’s not good for all the seals and everything. The timing belt has to be done regardless of all the mileage it’s Robert it breaks down, drive belts to Empire‘s. The tires too so you got a put some money into it even though it has under 6000 miles. And probably change the coolant and transmission fluid to and brake fluid. That’s the stuff you have to do regardless the mileage. And oil.
4935	October 25, 2019 3:44PM	marcogallo1986	@ Send man, glad you got to spend some time with your coworkers are used to work with at the post office yesterday. They get together once a month that’s awesome.

Does it have a talking function so I’d be able to use it? I should look into that.

You could tag along with us We might be out and about hitting some lots this weekend!"
4941	October 25, 2019 4:32PM	nyccarguy	Have a fantastic weekend @marcogallo1986 . No car shopping for me, but my Mom is on the hunt. Originally she had her heart set on a 2019 Porsche Macan, but the lease payment comes out to be just too high for her liking. She test drove a Cadillac XT5 yesterday afternoon and liked it. She is scheduled to test drive a Lexus RX350 on Saturday AM.
4942	October 25, 2019 4:35PM	tifighter	I don't know. Let's say $20k brings it home. Someone keeps it as a fun car for 5 years, puts another 10k miles on it. Don't we think this would get at least $20k on BAT five years from now with 15k miles?
4943	October 25, 2019 4:39PM	Michaell	"You could tag along with us We might be out and about hitting some lots this weekend!

Always happy to offer an opinion and help someone spend their money!"
4944	October 25, 2019 5:00PM	stickguy	Bradd, either of those options will certainly save on maintenance costs!
4945	October 25, 2019 5:02PM	dad23	I could probably use some opinions/suggestions, feel like I'm all over the board looking at options...
4946	October 25, 2019 5:05PM	Michaell	We should talk before hitting the lots.
4947	October 25, 2019 5:07PM	stickguy	We have nothing special planned this weekend, so I’ll arrange an errand outing that conveniently passes a couple dealers I want to stop at. And a brewery.
4948	October 25, 2019 5:08PM	stickguy	Now we’re talking! What are the basic criteria?
4949	October 25, 2019 5:14PM	nyccarguy	I'm hoping she takes a liking to the RX.
4950	October 25, 2019 5:33PM	stickguy	They are nice. We did like the NX a lot, but it was just a bit small in the back.
4951	October 25, 2019 5:34PM	dad23	I'm currently driving a 2013 Pilot which I like, have had no issues with it, it's just being handed down to new drivers in the household. I've had trucks in the past so was originally thinking a new Tundra or F150 but then thought I'd never really use it as a truck and don't want to be lending it out either I started looking at the Tahoe/Yukons for more room but figured we'd still have the Pilot if we ever needed to all go somewhere. So now I'm looking at the 4Runner, MDX/RDX, something along those lines. I've had back issues in the past so easier for me to get in and out of a bigger vehicle, otherwise the midlife crisis Corvette would be on the list! And I'm thinking lease as in another two years, it'll just be us, boys off to college (fingers crossed) and we may not need more than one vehicle. I'm thinking right around $500/mo or, again three off to college in a few years...
4952	October 25, 2019 5:43PM	stickguy	"Consider a ridgeline I think. Other than that, the RDX is very nice, just a size class smaller. Fun to drive. Volvo XC60, can’t beat the Seats! x3 is nice. Maybe cheaper option, a Santa Fe 2.0t limited.

And yes, I just named my current short list, minus the new outback XT!"
4953	October 25, 2019 6:13PM	Michaell	"I went through this exercise with @breld last weekend. I reviewed the options by manufacturer

GM - Enclave, Acadia, Traverse, Yukon, Tahoe
Ford - Explorer, Edge, Flex
FCA - Grand Cherokee, Durango
Honda - the Passport is nice; do you want another Pilot?
Acura - MDX, RDX
Nissan - Pathfinder, Murano, Armada
Infiniti - QX60
Toyota - 4Runner

Plus all the trucks.

I think the challenge will be to find something in the $500/mo range; you might surf the lease threads of the vehicles that interest you and see what others have done. I seem to remember a couple of 2019 Ram truck deals under $500/mo recently."
4954	October 25, 2019 6:27PM	fintail	I had an Armada rental late last year, effectively the same vehicle with maybe less complex suspension. Same thing, it was like going back to 2010 in tech (which is when I think the design debuted). I was almost surprised it had Bluetooth. To its credit, I recall build quality seemed high.
4955	October 25, 2019 6:46PM	dad23	Thanks @stickguy and @Michaell, a few of those are already on my list, a few new ones to consider!
4956	October 25, 2019 6:51PM	corvette	Oh, my QX was a base model which didn't have the fancy suspension, so probably the same as the Armada you rented. Brake dive was worse than my 10 year old Tahoe (with the original suspension and 130,000 miles). I really liked the interior other than the dated infotainment. Also, a pet peeve with Nissan/Infiniti products (including my G37) - the sound the doors make when you close them does not have the same sort of solidity as the German makes, and exterior door handles make a tinny, hollow sound when you release them. A little sound deadening would go a long way in fixing those issues, I think.
4957	October 25, 2019 7:05PM	kyfdx	I can guarantee the brewery part for this weekend...
4958	October 25, 2019 7:25PM	jmonroe1	"If I were you I'd just go to the brewery. It's probably free which is a hellava lot better than fighting off the hot-pants urge which could result in taking the chance of writing a check or signing up for lease payments. Deals are always better at the end of the year. You're almost there don't screw it up now.

4963	October 25, 2019 10:12PM	qbrozen	Depends on your needs. I did buy Bluedriver hoping it would fix my Chevy problem. But, truth is, I'll keep it because it covers all vehicles, while the Foxwell is (currently) ONLY for GM across certain years. This is the first issue I've had that a generic reader did not help me fix.
4964	October 25, 2019 10:37PM	xwesx	Bluedriver is great for code reading on basically anything. The Foxwell is brand-specific, IIRC. So, for example, I imagine that qbrozen's is for GM. I am not sure whether you can register additional manufacturer data on the same device or not.
4965	October 25, 2019 10:41PM	xwesx	Oh, whoops. Oh well. That's what I get for responding as I'm reading.

4967	October 25, 2019 11:20PM	pensfan83	Unfortunately I'm not as knowledgeable or mechanically inclined as you so I was mainly looking for a reader that would give me an idea of what the issue was and what the expected repair cost would be. In thankfully limited use so far its been good.
4968	October 25, 2019 11:36PM	stickguy	"wife and I (and the daughter when she is hanging with us) like to go to the various craft places near us. Some are quite good (beer quality wise) but they are all a fun time.

that scanner QB brought, from looking at the link, comes with 1 software package installed. and you can buy more. If can handle up to 5 packages at a time."
4969	October 26, 2019 12:35AM	ab348	JM, you’re forgetting that this is stickguy we’re talking about here. No chance of him getting something yet. He hasn’t made his short list of 47 possible choices yet nor gotten lease numbers from at least 5 places on each of them.
4970	October 26, 2019 12:39AM	stickguy	"hey, I already cut the short list down to 5. and then took one more off, so it is down to 4!

Remember, this is the wife's car, so the pool of possible options is much smaller. and almost positive this one will be a purchase, not lease."
4971	October 26, 2019 1:12AM	corvette	"May just keep it, then.

Second deck guy came in at $67 a square foot. Cheaper than my regular contractor but not a huge difference either way. Ugh."
4972	October 26, 2019 1:18AM	stickguy	"materials not cheap these days. and labor eats you up.

do you have an elevated deck? Any option to take most of it down and go with a patio of some sort?"

4974	October 26, 2019 2:09AM	stickguy	I saw a bunch of updates on that on FB. Looks like a fun time. Fattening and causing a headache maybe, but fun.
4975	October 26, 2019 2:12AM	jmonroe1	"Now you know why I do my own decks. Material costs are not marked up when I buy them and I don't charge myself to put it all together. Deck building is not the rocket surgery professional deck builders would have you believe it is.

4976	October 26, 2019 2:33AM	stickguy	"when we bought our first single family house (after a condo) it was a new build. I put the deck on myself (with a little help a few times from friends/family). But it was really not that hard. Just a simple box, maybe 15x20? Nothing overly fancy, but way overbuilt. One beam. Called for 3 posts, I think I put in 4 (maybe 5).

worst part was digging the post holes by hand, In august. In dirt recently packed down by construction equipment. nasty. Did that part after dark.

sold the house after about 7 years. Last time I drove by, sucker was still standing and looked pretty good, at least 25 years later.

only scary part was putting lag bolts into the house sill."
4977	October 26, 2019 2:35AM	stickguy	"if you can read instructions and use a tape measure and speed square, and a saw, and do basic math of course.

I imagine it can get complicated if you start getting into multiple levels and lots of angles. Mine was barely above grade (probably only had 2-3 steps off the far end to the yard)."
4978	October 26, 2019 3:31AM	xwesx	Building it is the fun part! After that, it is all work.
4979	October 26, 2019 3:56AM	jmonroe1	"When I built my first deck in the Summer of '89 (it was on my second house) and it was an extension off of a 7 by 9 foot covered porch. So I made the deck one step down from the existing porch. I guess you could call that a multi-level deck. I used a couple 1/2 lag screws to hold the deck ledger board in place at that point, then used about six 5/8 inch galvanized carriage bolts for the real support at that point. I know that thing was not coming down at that point after all that support. Since the deck was one story up I used six 6 x 6's to build two piers parallel to the house. You were a lot more energetic than I was about the digging because I rented a two man power 12 inch hole auger to drill down 5 feet for each 6 x 6. And yeah, I hit a few bricks that were thrown in as fill when that house was built (I was the second owner). Had to use a manual digger bar to get those bricks out of there but there was NO WAY in hell that I was going to dig six 12 inch diameter holes 5 feet deep manually with a digger bar. That damn sure was not going happen.

That house is just 2 blocks away from where I live now and I see the deck still standing when I ride by. The guy that bought that house when we moved to SC in '92 was true to his word about taking care of the deck because he knew he didn't want to pay to built another one.

Where there is a will there is a way. I mean, c'mon man, we're not talking about performing heart surgery on ourselves; it's just a measly deck.

4980	October 26, 2019 3:56AM	fintail	I think I recall something quirky on the Armada, like closing the front door hard and seeing it reverberate in the front fender. Interior materials were nicer than expected, no odd rattles etc, but I found the seat uncomfortable for long drives. I imagine when those find retail buyers, they sell at a nice discount. The Escalade I rented last month was exponentially more advanced, but you pay for it.

4982	October 26, 2019 12:24PM	kyfdx	That's why I recommend PVC decking and aluminum rails... no maintenance.

As for the GABF event, I suggest you put off helping others do car shopping for a couple minutes so can get us tickets before they're gone. Do you really want to try explaining how you screwed this up for all your poster buddies in here?

4984	October 26, 2019 1:27PM	stickguy	Unless it is elevated, when I finally move if the new house is not already deck equipped, I will be putting in a stamped concrete patio instead of a deck. Probably need a small landing platform though, unless the back is really close to grade level. But I have no intention of putting another deck on. And it definitely won't be wood if I have to.
4985	October 26, 2019 2:46PM	tjc78	I did a patio. No maintenance, I even had created with a semi circle at the end to place a fire pit in the middle and chairs around. Nothing glamorous but a nice place to chill with the only maintenance being a power wash once in a while

She said it “felt” too big and it was difficult for her to judge the front of the car while making right turns. The sales woman she is dealing with showed her an NX300 in the showroom. She sat in it and liked it, so they went for a test drive. Mom liked that better anD the sales woman will email me a quote for her based on the parameters I discussed.

She’s going back to drive the Cadillac again now."

5000	October 26, 2019 7:57PM	ab348	Yeah, I agree that the latest Caddy numerology is pretty obscure. I suspect that will not last long. Though given they are supposedly GM's flagship line for electrification I guess they will need something other than displacement to proclaim.
5001	October 26, 2019 8:30PM	qbrozen	It makes far less sense to me when you have only one engine option.
5002	October 26, 2019 8:46PM	fintail	Regarding Caddy naming weirdness, DeNysschen seems to leave a little chaos in his wake, and also has an ability to fail upwards. Good old boys club.

5007	October 26, 2019 11:30PM	stickguy	"Snuck a test drive in today. Wife wanted to go to the giant ""at home"" store a few towns over to look for baskets for the coffee table (my idea was get rid of the dead crap in them and don't have any baskets, was not well received). So, since we had nothing special to do and wife was grumbly about doing something, I offered to take her. Knowing that we had to pass right by a couple of my favorite dealers to get there, so made a quick detour into the Subaru dealer parking lot at about 3:30ish. Surprised (probably good for Subaru) that the place was hopping, but a salesguy greeted us out in the parking lot. Told him we wanted to drive an OB, so got taken inside to see one on the floor and then off to his desk for interrogation some questions.

Oh, did I mention that they pop up a ""come in to test drive, get $50"" promo when you look at inventory? Of course, I printed that off, and handed to him at the beginning. so in a few days will get a $50 Visa gift card. Not a bad days work. Whenever we can finally get out to Hyundai, they have the same thing, and I definitely will be bringing it! May have to put Cadillac back on the list (they have one too), Hey, cars are expensive (so are baskets), gotta pay for them somehow.

anyway, as to the car. Drove a nice blue OB limited, base engine. Turns out the wife liked the color, a good start. Car is really, really nice. Superb seats, with a nice thigh extension for the driver. we both were comfortable with how we could set them. New giant center screen was very nice, and excellent graphics. The map looked better than having google maps up on my iPad. Puts my TLX to shame. Tons of room in the back seat. Quiet, good ride, nice handling, and being more carlike, great visibility especially to the front. Feels smaller than it really is, especially in tight quarters.

only negatives (admittedly it was a short drive) are that the engine was kinda weak (wife mentioned it had much less oomph than her RDX). Not an issue, since I would get the XT anyway, but always good to test the base engine first to make sure you need the HiPo one. In this case, you do. And the wife really hates the auto stop/start. Normally not a big deal, since you can turn it off. The salesguy did it, but instead of a dedicated button, it was buried about 4 menus deep. Which would be a problem, since per him, it reset every time you start the car to be active. Need some research on that, but could be a deal breaker for her!

anyway, outside of that one quibble, it was a seriously impressive package. No wonder they are selling like hotcakes. And one interesting tidbit. SG said that while in the past the H6 had a very small take rate (>10%) on the new one, the XT seems to be the engine everyone wants, so can't get enough of them for inventory."
5008	October 26, 2019 11:45PM	suydam	Excellent visibility has always been a hallmark of Subaru. Glad they’re sticking with it.
5009	October 26, 2019 11:52PM	stickguy	one thing I hate about a lot of the CUVs now. Not just the giant rear blindspots and tiny rear window, is they have oversized, big blocky noses, so feel like driving a PU, where you can't see what's in front of you.
5010	October 26, 2019 11:56PM	ab348	The ATS has stop/start but it has a button to switch it off on the console. Like the Subie, you need to do it every time you start the car. That's a pain. I eventually got used to the stop/start so I don't bother switching it off any more. It is only slightly intrusive.
5011	October 27, 2019 12:07AM	corvette	I keep a roadside emergency kit in both cars and a set of extra-long heavy duty jumper cables in the Tahoe. Put the scrapers and a container of salt in them during the winter months.
5012	October 27, 2019 12:08AM	stickguy	I would be fine with a button that you just poked right after starting the car. Becomes muscle memory. Just don't want to have to deal with scrolling through multiple menus. Or more accurately, the wife won't want to. And not sure if she will just get used to it!

5017	October 27, 2019 4:00AM	fintail	The 350T thing yes, but IIRC he was 100% behind the XT5/CT6 etc idea, which as a one trick pony, is exactly what he did at Infiniti, who has cars that make Caddy look like the pillar of relevancy. I wouldn't want him managing my car company.
5018	October 27, 2019 5:48AM	xwesx	"Interesting note about the stop/start. I didn't realize that Subaru did that with their cars. We have had a couple of rentals with that feature - the first being an Escape a couple years ago. It was certainly alarming/annoying at first, but I quickly figured out how to manipulate it to either, 1., not happen just by the way I operated the brake pedal, or 2., turn the engine on just slightly before I anticipated actually needing the engine to operate (such as at red lights). Once I had it sorted out, it didn't bother me at all any more,, and I never bothered hunting for how to turn off the feature.

I agree, though... having the option to turn off something like that, but then having the car auto-reset it to the choice you do NOT want each time you shut off the car, is really, really, REALLY frustrating."
5019	October 27, 2019 12:25PM	roadburner	I think that the Eco Gestapo at the EPA now requires stop/start to be on at startup- unlike my X1 and 2er; I think that the feature can be coded to stay off on later BMWs and Minis.
5020	October 27, 2019 12:35PM	ab348	"I think the business about naming was very overblown. You had the die-hards who wanted them to bring back old names like Eldorado and Seville which were utterly meaningless, old-fashioned and could be very confusing. Prior to his time they went to the ""TS"" series for sedans - starting with the STS and DTS, then CTS and ATS. Confusion reigned when they went to the XT5 and XTS, one a SUV and the other a sedan. So there is at least some logic now, with CT# for sedans and XT# for SUVs. The Escalade is the lone holdout because that is the one ""wordy"" name that has significant brand equity, so they are scared to touch it.

I find it strange how some continue to lambaste Cadillac for its naming convention while other makes like Infiniti, BMW, Lexus, Audi and even M-B can be even more confusing."
5021	October 27, 2019 1:09PM	stickguy	"my son figured out how to disable it automatically on at least 1 of his Genesis/Audi. If you kept it in a performance driving mode (sport or sport+) it disabled the auto start/stop. Though I would not want my wife driving around at 5,000 RPMs all the time instead.

I assume the Santa Fe has the same set-up as the Gemesis (dash looks similar). Dedicated button by the shift lever. Just get in the habit of pushing that when you put it in gear. Becomes muscle memory, like pushing the button to turn the parking brake off."
5022	October 27, 2019 1:17PM	ab348	I really believe you do get used to it if my experience is anything to go by. It is jarring at first but that goes away quickly. It is actually nice in certain situations.
5023	October 27, 2019 1:21PM	tjc78	"My Volvo once you turn it off in the settings it’s gone forever... thank goodness

Closing up the campground today. No more weekends away until April! (Well here anyway) Luckily my buddy who has a place here is a pro at winterizing and has the pump for the antifreeze!"
5024	October 27, 2019 1:42PM	stickguy	"the Sube was not the best I ever drove in terms of not noticing, but far from the worst. Could probably get used to it, though I still believe it will have LT durability issues. Not a problem on a lease, but since I would like to keep that car 10 years, could be an issue!

I did tell the wife that like anything, you will get used to it (along with a whole lot of other differences going to a ""modern"" car). Turns out it is largely mental. She is worried that it won't turn back on when it needs to, and she will be stuck at a stop not moving! I politely pointed out that she was over thinking this. And that pushing the button was not a big deal (assuming there is one) though she seems to be adamant that it is a huge problem to have to do that. I think she is becoming a Luddite. Maybe should just keep the RDX forever for her, even without navigation of any sort or blind spot, etc., since she seems to know how to use what she needs to. Though can't make a call without picking up her phone to do it, that I know."
5025	October 27, 2019 2:49PM	kyfdx	"We had our 2011 X3 up to 94K miles... not one issue with stop/start.

Currently at 36K on the 2017 model, and again.. no issues.

We leave it on, almost all of the time. Except in very slow stop/go traffic (where it would constantly cycle, like a freeway traffic jam)

Ours is easy though.. a button next to the stop/start button. Doesn't re-set, that I've noticed. Stays where you leave it."
5026	October 27, 2019 3:28PM	corvette	"I think the Freestar and Exploder both had ""Advancetrac RSC"" badges after Ford scurried to put stability control on their vans and SUVs after the Firestone tire fiasco."
5027	October 27, 2019 3:30PM	corvette	"I thought they would run the MPG test with it off, if it doesn't default to ""on"" at startup, so there's no benefit to the manufacturers installing it unless it defaults to on."
5028	October 27, 2019 4:29PM	stickguy	I think that is it corvette. I can't believe it makes that much of a real world difference, but every ounce counts to the car companies. Restarting all the time has to eat into the savings.
5029	October 27, 2019 6:01PM	fintail	"I think Caddy would be well-served using some traditional names. Caddy's differentiation needs to be that it is American - few have even marginally succeeded at truly emulating the Germans (Lexus LS comes closest by far), eventually it becomes time to try a new game. I find Fleetwood to be more compelling than CT6.

I just find it funny that deNysschen played the same game at two companies, both of which now are dearly striving for relevancy. Coincidence? Hard to believe. He's the Brian Burke of the automotive industry suit set - has a few mediocre-at-best laurels, which he rests on heavily, sometimes leaves chaos in his wake, and because of a network of similarly barely filled-out suits, can always find a job and no doubt helps find similar for friends and/or family too.

The Germans may now have numbers more linked to power than displacement, but the basic convention remains the same, MB has been using a number/letter ideal for about 90 years now."
5030	October 27, 2019 6:01PM	carnaught	Some stop/starts on cars are more intrusive than others. Surprisingly, my late model Mercedes’ had very noticeable sound and shutter with each re-start.
5031	October 27, 2019 6:03PM	fintail	For stop/start, I know there are MB software hacks to get around it. It doesn't bother me - the button for it is right on the console, and with traffic around here, it might actually save a teacup of fuel now and then. I usually switch it off if I know I won't be stopping for long periods, or will be going quick stop maneuvers like tight turns in garages etc.

5034	October 27, 2019 6:32PM	stickguy	I am more than fine getting it if the button is right there on the console/center stack to disable. Just one more thing to push on start up. Would end up doing it without even looking or thinking about it.
5035	October 27, 2019 6:57PM	ab348	I knew I wasn't imaging it - discovered that 1971-72 Chevy (and presumably GMC) pickups had this decal applied to the top left of the tailgate if equipped with disc brakes.
5036	October 27, 2019 7:43PM	stickguy	"3rd base coaching my SILs attempt to trade in her expiring RDX lease on a new RDX lease. Quite messy financially it seems, though I imagine the dealer would have no problem playing games to make all that work out. She is intending to just extend month to month until year end (allowing for a job change to happen in a couple of weeks) but of course, the dealer would much prefer just get her butt into a new seat instead.

can't wait to see how this one ends up. Though if they let her keep the current car at the same payment (considerably lower than what a new one would go for) it makes sense to keep that as long as possible, and take advantage of year end holiday incentives."
5037	October 27, 2019 8:31PM	stickguy	"well, that did not go as planned (but probably as expected). She texted that a deal is inked, will pick up Thursday.

2020 RDX, AWD base (I pushed Tech, but $ ruled). Red over beige (color combo my wife would likely get, could be a problem!). Not sure all the details, but ended up being $379/month, $2,550 total OOP DAS. 36/10 I think. MSRP just about $41k.

Should be a nice upgrade. In since the 2017 she turned in was also a base car, won't be losing anything (and gaining a bunch of safety nannies, laser cruise, and car play giving her the Navi she missed having)."
5038	October 27, 2019 8:36PM	nyccarguy	Got an email from the sales woman at the Lexus dealer. Had to check the date to make sure it wasn’t April 1. 36/15K per year with 1st & DMV DAS is $645 per month. I emailed her for a specific breakdown this AM. She’s off today (dealer is closed) and will get back to me tomorrow.

Just checked Rodo. In my zip, an NX300 premium, MSRP $46,382, 36/15, 1st payment DAS is $554/month.

same car, sticker $43,082, (moonroof package/comfort package/parking package, the exact way I would have gotten it) is $516 month/ $516 DAS.

so I think you got some room to negotiate."

5041	October 27, 2019 9:26PM	kyfdx	Agreed
5042	October 27, 2019 9:58PM	nyccarguy	The NX300 is out. She re-drove the XT5 and likes it a lot better.

5044	October 27, 2019 10:43PM	stickguy	if the NX was big enough, how about an XT4? That is the comparable model, and definitely still roomier. I liked the one I sat in! the 5 is as big as an RX, though probably more appropriate to replace a Cayan.
5045	October 27, 2019 10:47PM	stickguy	"from my poking around it really was a very strong deal. I would have grabbed it if I wanted that model.

heard back from her. Deal is in limbo with the finance office. Not sure they will get it through or what will happen (might end up in a cheaper sedan, ILX or TLX, to smoke and mirrors a deal together that AFS will approve). Won't know until Tuesday but the finance guy likes her (3rd time customer) and when is is back in will start working angles, and promises they will get her in ""something"" so she is not carless."
5046	October 27, 2019 10:53PM	nyccarguy	Yes. She currently drives a 2016 V6 Porsche Cayenne
5047	October 27, 2019 10:54PM	nyccarguy	"She liked the way the NX drove, but thought it might be tight in the back. So she went to drive the Caddy again.

1st time in I don’t know how many years my parents will have 3 GM cars"
5048	October 27, 2019 11:13PM	stickguy	using my quick and dirty Rodo research, XT5 @46K is about same lease as the NX300 @46K sticker.

NYC, take mom to Darien, show her an F-Pace... gee, no one saw that coming from me. Treat her to Duchess."
