Certainly my T&C did not go into limp mode when the O2 sensor failed. And down through the years, I have helped quite a few with bad O2 sensors, and I do not recall any of them going into limp mode.

And ""would not drive"" does not compute. ""Limp mode"" is short hand for ""limp home mode"". The car will still drive, but you will have reduced power.

I suspect your ""friend"" misrepresented things."

6	June 11, 2019 2:19AM	28firefighter	"Punch for me. But it isn’t a car and doesn’t have a motor. 

Think I mentioned that I WFH full-time and when we bought our house 18 months ago, the plan was to use the “formal” dining room as my office. Only problem was it wasn’t enclosed and I’ve just had things in the open. 

3 months ago we custom ordered a set of French doors to enclose the office that would allow us to retain the natural light we get through the window in that room and match the house like it was from new. 

May not seem like much, but trying to find doors to fit a nearly 8x8 opening is harder than you’d think. 

Voila:

10	June 11, 2019 2:55AM	mb_enthusiast	I went to check out a 2016 Cayenne GTS, 2019 Cayenne S, and 2019 Macan S. I hated the 2016 Cayenne GTS. I felt that the 2019 Cayenne S was a ripoff and didn't handle much better than my Q8 or really much of anything else on that platform, but definitely better than the 2016 Cayenne. I really liked the Macan S. Are Porsches worth it?

14	June 11, 2019 3:49AM	stickguy	"nice looking doors. We have a similar set up (standard center hall colonial) where the ""formal"" LR is to the right as you come in the door, behind the stairs, with the opening, well, open. Useless room. We have a desk (and desktop PC) that we never use, and a couch that gets sat on at Thanksgiving maybe. Would be much better set-up like yours, with doors to create an office space. Even though it is probably 2x as big as it needs to be. If I was able to redesign it, I would make it a more compact office in the front, and add the rest to the family room that is behind it.

easier to just move of course and get what I want!"
15	June 11, 2019 3:49AM	nyccarguy	Since we are on a Pittsburgh Lovefest, my 10 year old son’s Flag Football Team won the league championship on Sunday!  His team?  Obligatory trophy pic:
16	June 11, 2019 3:53AM	corvette	"Same, even though I file single--that's going to be a common refrain for a lot of the middle class. Really reduces the potential value of the mortgage interest deduction for a lot of people. On the other hand, my fixed interest rate on my primary residence is something like 3.75%, so not awful even if it's not deductible.

A lot of the state-specific deductions in our fair state's income tax got eliminated in 2018, too.

Looking at the last few years of my late, widowed, great-aunt's tax returns, she paid around $6-7,000 in federal taxes and close to zero state with an AGI of about $55,000 consisting of mostly taxable SS benefits, interest income, a pension, and some state tax-exempt bonds. My goal is zero fed and state tax by the time I stop working and draw SS... fortunately, I have quite a long time to plan that!"
17	June 11, 2019 4:02AM	stickguy	my goal is to have so much money flowing in when I retire I need 2 accountants to keep track of it all. Sadly, I don't think that is likely to happen.
18	June 11, 2019 4:09AM	corvette	LOL, yes, obviously I want that with the zero taxes!
19	June 11, 2019 4:20AM	28firefighter	Now now, @nyccarguy, I never said I was a Pittsburgh sports fan. I still bleed green. 
20	June 11, 2019 11:40AM	au1994	"Our X6 went into 'reduced power' mode once. It was still fine and safe to drive, IE would do 60 just labored to do it. Pulled off and turned it off and on and it was fine.

My 335 convertible had a water pump issue and went into that mode and I pulled over and left it. It wouldn't do 30. Not that I would have wanted to run it with a bum water pump anyway. 30 would get you flattened around here."
21	June 11, 2019 11:56AM	kyfdx	"@28firefighter Nice doors!
@nyccarguy Cute kid!

@corvette Zero taxes? Hilarious. The KY state changes have definitely not helped seniors. My 91 yr old uncle owed state income taxes for the first time in years. Also, once RMDs hit when you are 70? If you've been a big saver and user of 401K and traditional IRAs, you are going to get a huge tax bill, each year. I'm starting to see why so many people move to FL, where there is no state income tax. Still trying to figure that out (but, nine years left until RMDs)"
22	June 11, 2019 1:31PM	Sandman6472	"Nice doors...and stairs. Gave up stairs over 30 years ago when we sold the townhouse. Now, so glad we have a one story home.
RMD's I think have to start once one is 70 and 1/2 but would have to ask my CPA wife to find out for sure. I just hope I make it to that age so I can start pulling out some funds. Looking to start putting more into muni bonds so if I do pass earlier than I'd like, the kids will have something. Not really necessary to leave them anything, but since my grandma and dad did for me, feel I should do the same for my 3 no matter how large or small. Since I'll be turning 65 later this year, have a lot to think about such as Medicare and deciding how long I stay at Hertz. Thinking that mid 2020 might just be the right time to make a quiet exit.
And hoping to move by the end of 2020 or early 2021 up to central or southwest Florida. Getting way to crowded down here...been here almost 50 years!"

25	June 11, 2019 2:40PM	corvette	@kyfdx I’ve been doing Roth conversions for a while. Didn’t do any last year because my income was abnormally high, but every little bit helps. They are talking about raising the RMD age to 72. 
26	June 11, 2019 3:02PM	kyfdx	"We've been doing some Roth conversions. Unfortunately, KY dropped the exemption for retirement income from $41K to $31K. I can still fit some conversion in that window, without triggering state income taxes, but my wife's pension puts her over the limit. That reduces some of the incentive for doing that.

Federal income taxes are very low, in general. But, if you get a big investment return in one year, it just kills you."

28	June 11, 2019 4:19PM	Sandman6472	"Need to start doing the Roth conversions but figure I'll wait till I retire again and then start since our income will be lower.
The Medicare issue is complex as my government health insurance is a secondary insurance, not a supplemental kind. My wife is under my insurance and always has been, and always will. Have been told that since I've started taking my s s benefits, I'd be automatically enrolled in Medicare. But thinking I'd like to put it off a year until she she turns 65, and then both of us use Medicare. Since my current health insurance is a secondary one, kind of muddies up the waters so just not sure what to do at this juncture? Guess being a retired federal employee under civil service complicates things. All I know is that once I pass, she'll get my pension though at a reduced percentage, probably half, as I recall. Filled out so much paperwork back then that it's hard to remember it all."
29	June 11, 2019 5:00PM	carnaught	Consider yourself lucky you don’t/didn’t have to deal with the high deductible, high premium debacle of health insurance the rest of us had to.
30	June 11, 2019 6:28PM	kyfdx	So, I should be complaining about my $2200 monthly healthcare premium?
31	June 11, 2019 6:59PM	carnaught	I think our wonderful legislators should have to deal with health insurance that we peons have had to.

Turning 70 and a half next year . . ."
33	June 11, 2019 7:40PM	kyfdx	Don't wait until the next year.... you'll have two RMDs that year. No grace period on the 2nd year.
34	June 11, 2019 8:12PM	rayainsw	"Agree - from a tax perspective...
- Ray
Plan to take my 1st RMD next year."
35	June 11, 2019 8:16PM	stickguy	lots of people screw up that first one. you can take it before 1/1 to spread them out into 2 different tax years. But once you wait until 4/1 you have to get the second one too by 12/31.
36	June 11, 2019 9:07PM	mjfloyd1	Is RMD a required minimum distribution?
37	June 11, 2019 9:26PM	stickguy	yes.
38	June 11, 2019 10:07PM	corvette	As opposed to RWD. 
39	June 11, 2019 10:12PM	corvette	We’re at 3100 pages of CCBA discussion. My first car had a GM 3100 V6. That engine didn’t have the following that the 3800 did, but you could hear the pushrods thrashing around just as well. 
40	June 11, 2019 11:58PM	ab348	I never liked the 2800/3100/3400 series of engines. They all had a clattering sound like a sewing machine.

42	June 12, 2019 11:43AM	nyccarguy	At the end of March 2017, I purchased my 2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD as a CPO car.  The person who leased it originally drove only 7,468 miles in 2 1/2 years.  I have put significantly more miles on it since then.  
43	June 12, 2019 11:53AM	qbrozen	"Is that the only car you drive?

miles like that is why I have my wife in more than one vehicle."
44	June 12, 2019 11:55AM	au1994	I've driven quite a few of the 3.8 GM engines and while it may be loud and a little rough, it makes good power. My mom had a Cutlass Ciera with it and that would move nicely when driven by a 17 year old.
45	June 12, 2019 11:58AM	tjc78	"I just looked at the miles on the Enclave (it's usually hidden, by miles to empty) and we just crossed 20. Sept is 2 years so pretty much on point with the 12K /yr lease.

The Elantra still hasn't crossed 17K and goes back in November.... guess we should drive that one more.

Wife has been using that for her 10 mile round trip commute to the train. She likes how easy it is to park. So, I have been mostly driving the Enclave. As nice and comfortable as that thing is I just prefer a car."
46	June 12, 2019 12:30PM	ab348	My only experience with the 3800 was in my first-gen Lacrosse and it disappointed me. But I concluded that was due to a faulty transmission they never did get fixed properly and which led me to unload the thing. I based that on the performance of a loaner Lacrosse with the same engine I got one time the dealer was tearing my transmission apart again. The loaner was much more zippy than my car.
47	June 12, 2019 12:46PM	stickguy	"my TLX turns 6 months old (time flies!) next week. Should be sitting right about 4,000 miles by then. The Sonata went back at the end of the 3 year lease with 20.500 on it. The RDX turns 7 in September, and that is still just under 54,000.

we need to get out more!"
48	June 12, 2019 1:58PM	nyccarguy	"@qbrozen

Pretty much. Since I had the clutch replaced last year for a tidy sum (It is almost time for the 2nd timing belt replacement and my tires are shot), I've pretty much kept my Prelude parked. Also I have to park on the street here at work and I know one day it is going to get hit (It is inevitable, like Thanos). I could take my wife's Pilot a few days per week. Besides the miles, the Q40 sucks down 93 at a rate of less than 20 mpg. Gas is expensive in CT and I'm filling up to the tune of about $57 - $60 once a week (ish).

Ideally I'd be looking to get into a 2 year lease of something where they don't kill you if you go over the miles or let you buy the miles in advance at a significant discount. I've toyed in my head to see if it would be financially advantageous to lease 2 cars with 10K per year, but that's way more expensive than leasing a car and paying for the extra miles up front. I'm open to suggestions as always!

Part of the reason I was looking at the Tacoma is due to the fact that I could take out a 12K per year lease in order to take advantage of the high residual value, put down the MSD (which lowers the monthly payment by about $50/month), and then use the MSD to pay for the extra 16,000 miles (plus the disposition fee) I'd drive during the 2 year lease (TFS only charges $.15 per mile if you go over) when I turn it in at the end of the lease.

If I were to take a 15,000 mile per year lease on a car that charges $.25 per mile over, then I would go over my miles (and likely be out of warranty at some point during the lease). It would cost me an extra $3,750 over 3 years (plus tax) or $104.17 per month. On a 2 year/15,000 mile per year lease, I'd only go over my miles by 10,000 which would cost me the same $104.17 per month, but $2,500 total."
